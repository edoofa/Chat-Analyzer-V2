14/08/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Greetings. Rumbidzai is now available to do her sessions.
29/08/23, 10:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
That is great. I would like to schedule a session with you on Monday i.e. *04-09-2023 from 8:30 am to 9:30 am*, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
29/08/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 300 3401: Good morning. I will be available as the parent but Rumbidzai will be going back to school on Sunday 03/08/2023. Schools are opening on the 4th of September. Is it not possible to have the session between now and Friday. I apologise for the inconveniences this might cause. In Zimbabwe candidate classes go to school during the holidays to prepare students for examinations.
31/08/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon
Thank you for letting me know. May I know from when Rumbidzai will be available? <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Good afternoon Jasmine. Rumbidzai is commencing her final examination this september and finishes mid November. Thereafter she will be free.
31/08/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 300 3401: She starts her examinations on the 18th September and finishes on the 10th of November.
01/09/23, 8:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Mr. Zimusi
I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing Rumbidzai's schedule with me. I can see that she will be occupied till the 10th of November. 
So, May I know that can we resume our sessions from 11th November?
01/09/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 300 3401: Good morning Jasmine. Yes we can schedule our sessions on the 11th November. My apologies for any inconveniences this might have caused. Thank you.
01/09/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you for reaching out to me Mr. Zimusi. 
Have a nice day ahead!
15/09/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:47 am - +263 77 300 3401: Greetings Jasmine. I am doing well, thanks. Rumbidzai is at school right now. The major challenge we have is the school doesnt allow students to bring phones at school. I will have to try and talk to the school authorities. I will update once I get response from the school. My apologies for conviniences this might be causing.
21/10/23, 5:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening,
I hope everything is going well for you. I understand that your child isn't currently available to begin the "Earn While You Learn" program. However, I'd like to suggest if you could complete the initial orientation part with me today.

Could you let me know if this is possible for you?
21/10/23, 7:24 pm - ~ Mai Two was added
21/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 312 3999: Good evening. Its ok if it's doable
21/10/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 312 3999 left
21/10/23, 5:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since I will be connected to your child for the longest period and I will be their mentor, the guide, and a friend throughout the journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when they are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
21/10/23, 5:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 5:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: In case you face any problems while viewing the video, please let me know.
21/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 300 3401: M having challenges downloading, keeping on trying though
21/10/23, 6:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, You can watch it when your network is good.
21/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Noted thanks
21/10/23, 6:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/10/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I will be grateful if you can take us through the objectives
21/10/23, 6:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure, Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Rumbidzai is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
21/10/23, 6:28 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Noted, thank you.
21/10/23, 6:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees
21/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 300 3401: If you can explain how the student earns these scholarship credits and how they are converted into money to reduce the fees.
21/10/23, 6:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, we have scholarship programs that allow students to earn credits. We'll discuss these programs in detail during our session. As an example, let's consider Rumbidzai's university fees. Her semester fee is $1,000, but she's been able to earn $500 through the EWYL PROGRAM. As a result, she only needs to pay $500 directly to the university, and we will cover the remaining $500 on her behalf to ensure her semester fee is fully taken care of.
21/10/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Noted thank you.
21/10/23, 6:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 

Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
21/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 300 3401: M pleased to know Ms. Sanjana. It's always great to know that you are all concerned about the students' wellbeing. I thank you.
21/10/23, 6:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
21/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Noted
21/10/23, 6:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
21/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Ok thank you.
21/10/23, 6:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Rumbidzai to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
21/10/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I have taken note, thank you.
21/10/23, 6:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
21/10/23, 6:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I have gone through the newsletter, quite insightful and inspirational.
21/10/23, 7:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Rumbidzai’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
21/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Big objectives, noted thank you.
21/10/23, 7:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
21/10/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 300 3401: It's fine
21/10/23, 7:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 7:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I know if is it clear?
21/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 300 3401: It's clear, what time is the next session
21/10/23, 7:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You can answer these questions till Monday.
21/10/23, 7:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if is Rumbidzai available for the sessions that will be held twice a week.
21/10/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Rumbidzai is not available at the moment. She is in boarding school. Unfortunately the school does not allow students to bring phones to school. This is primarily because of historical events where some unscrupulous students shared leaked examinations. This was an unfortunate incident which went on to ruin the life of these students. They were suspended from all educational activities. She is currently sitting for her final A'level exams. Like I indicated she will finish these examinations on the 10th of November.
21/10/23, 7:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to draft a mail to me stating that:

Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because  _  from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Jasmine as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - ewyl@edoofa.com, and jasmine.edoofa@gmail.com, sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com.

 Once you are done, kindly let me know so that I can confirm.
21/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Thank you, I will do that. I am sorry for any inconveniences that this might have caused.
21/10/23, 7:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Don't worry about that. It was lovely talking to you.
21/10/23, 7:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a great evening ahead!
21/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Same to you Jasmine.
23/10/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 300 3401: Good morning, Irequest for postponement of EWYL program for Rumbidzai Zimusi.
28/10/23, 8:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good evening_,* @263773003401 
I trust you're doing well. It has indeed been a while since we last communicated. The Edoofa Community has been bustling with activity, and I, as Rumbidzai's mentor, believe it's essential for you all to stay informed about the latest developments.

*To facilitate this, we've devised a timetable where I'll be sharing updates and content with you once a week*. In return, I kindly request that you acknowledge and provide your feedback. May I know if is it clear? 
Please feel free to discuss.
29/10/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 300 3401: Good morning Jasmine. We are ready and await for the updates. Thank you.
31/10/23, 5:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good afternoon, our cherished Rumbidzai and the wonderful parents,*

It's been a while since the arrival of our 2023 batch, and this week, I'm delighted to share the fantastic adventures these students are embracing, with us right there to celebrate alongside.

*_1. We have stationed our dedicated team members in every university, not just to provide support but also to add an extra layer of joy to their journey._*
*_2. And the excitement doesn't stop there! Our spirited students are diving headfirst into a whirlwind of activities, from passionate debates and thrilling chess♟️ showdowns to high-flying basketball 🏀 matches and much more._* 

Get ready to be captivated by the colorful snapshots of their joyous journey.

31/10/23, 5:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I'd love to know about your personal interests and the hobbies you'd like to see your child pursue during their time at university. Also, don't forget to share how you felt after watching the videos and the photos.
31/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 300 3401: It was amazing seing how much effort you are putting in making the children feel at home. The activities are team building and children from diverse backgrounds will not feel out of place. I really don't have a definitive hobby, I like to spent much of my time at home watching soccer on tv.  Rumbidzai appears to love public speaking, though she is more of an introvert. It has been a pleasure watching the videos, it makes us feel good to know children will be under such caring people.
14/11/23, 12:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263773003401 
I trust everyone is doing well. I hope Rumbidzai has successfully completed the exams. 

Could you please update me on whether *Rumbidzai is prepared to resume the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM?*
14/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Good afternoon Jasmine. Yes I can confirm that Rumbidzai successfully completed her exams. She is home now and ready to resume.
14/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 300 3401: I have network challenges
14/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 300 3401: Please add Rumbidzai to the group +263779969746
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa added +263 77 996 9746
17/11/23, 7:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening Rumbidzai*, 
I trust you're in good health, and your exams went smoothly. I'm delighted to learn that you're back to participate in the Earn While You Learn Program.
_Session Schedule_
_*Monday and Thursday from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm*_
The sessions will be conducted on the *EWYL LINE*

May I know that are you comfortable with the new schedule?
17/11/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 996 9746: Good evening ma'am 

Yes I'm comfortable with the schedule thank you.
20/11/23, 10:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Rumbidzai*
How are you doing today? You know, while I was traveling to the office today, I thought that we were already late to begin our EWYL journey and work on the project, as you were occupied with your exams. So, I was thinking of connecting on a daily basis here in your EWYL group.

This way, I can ensure proper guidance and an effective path to work on your project, maximizing scholarship credits. *Therefore, from now on, let us connect at 8:30 am in the morning in your EWYL group to proceed with your EWYL journey*!
May I know will that is okay?
20/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 996 9746: That is okay
20/11/23, 12:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That sounds fantastic! We will begin following this timetable starting tomorrow, and it's important that you are punctual.

 Additionally, I'd like to give you a little homework. Kindly scroll through our previous conversations, and afterward, share what you recall from our past discussions. 
Can you complete this before our session tomorrow?
20/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 996 9746: I lost the chats so it might be impossible for me to complete that by tomorrow
20/11/23, 2:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Will you be able to use your Dad's phone for this?
20/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 996 9746: Yes ...I will be able to do that
20/11/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay
21/11/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Rumbidzai
I hope you are in great spirits. 

Are you ready for the session?
21/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 300 3401: Good morning Jasmine. Rumbidzai is at the government offices processing her passport at the moment. She might not be able to attend the session. My apologies for that.
21/11/23, 9:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I appreciate your update, but it's important to note that this session was pre-scheduled. If Rumbidzai had plans to visit the office for her passport, do you think it's her responsibility to inform me in advance about her unavailability?
21/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 300 3401: Yes it's her responsibility, maybe she will respond. When I checked on her she then indicated that they have been advised not to be on phones. We didn't anticipate that it might be difficult to be chatting while doing her business. Apologies for that Jasmine
21/11/23, 9:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Thankyou for letting me know Mr. Zimusi
22/11/23, 5:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you done your homework Rumbidzai?
22/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 996 9746: Yes I did ....looked up onto some things that we discussed previously
22/11/23, 6:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Kindly go ahead and let me know.
22/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 996 9746: Okay I will start with the EWYL program which is the most dominant part of the program where students earn scholarships credits by doing various projects and this would make their tertiary education a whole lot affordable for example if I'm supposed to pay 600 for this term and I earn 300 worth scholarship credits I would pay half the school fees since Edoofa would cater for the remaining half .
It also helps students acquire new skills by taking part in jobs which would make it easier to perform these jobs in the future since they will be mostly associated with the career the student is bound to pursue.it also helps students to boost their entrepreneurship skills
22/11/23, 6:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Are you aware of the program structure Rumbidzai?
22/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 996 9746: Secondly I want to talk about the newsletters that the founder Mr Anghad sends every week to Edoofians .This newsletter includes some inspirational quotes which helps students to keep on going to achieve their dreams and the newsletter also includes the Edoofa hall of inspiration where students share their experiences in the community they are in ....how they are making it a better place and how they will benefit from various things you will be contributing towards them
22/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 996 9746: No im not
22/11/23, 6:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress
22/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 996 9746: Okay
22/11/23, 6:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
22/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 996 9746: Okay noted
22/11/23, 6:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
22/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 996 9746: Got that

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
22/11/23, 6:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 996 9746: Yes its clear

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
