Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
24/08/23, 8:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 8:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am dropping a video that will help you know me a little better.
24/08/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 096 7585: Ok. The video we take quite a long time to download because of poor Network
24/08/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You can watch the video after the session. So Priscillar, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
24/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 096 7585: I would like to become a pharmacist and to own a pharmacy. I think EWYL Program will help me in achieving these long term goals of mine through helping me to get the best studies and assisting with the payments needed
24/08/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I'm truly excited to hear about your aspirations to become a pharmacist and eventually own your own pharmacy. It's a commendable goal, and I'm here to support you every step of the way on your journey. All the Best!
24/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 096 7585: Thank you very much for the support
24/08/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, have you heard of the EWYL Program before? If so, can you provide me with some information about it?
So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
24/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 096 7585: Yes l have heard quite a lot about the program. I have heard that l will be given tasks so that l can earn scholarship credits which will assist me with the university payments
24/08/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct!
The EWYL (Earn While You Learn) Program aims to provide accessible, affordable, and employable higher education. Through this program, you will acquire 21st-century skills, enhancing your employability for future job opportunities. Additionally, you will earn scholarship credits that will help lower your expenses. 

Now, I am delighted to inform you that I have two documents that will provide you with comprehensive information about our program. These documents have been carefully crafted to offer insights into our vision, the courses we offer, and how your entire journey with us will unfold.
24/08/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The session is coming to an end now. It has been wonderful conversing with you, and I look forward to our next meeting tomorrow at 8:30 a.m.
Take care until then!
24/08/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 096 7585: Thank you for clearly explaining about the program. I am glad to hear that there are documents which can help me to understand more about the program
29/08/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
30/08/23, 3:13 am - +263 78 096 7585: How are you. I had a problem with my phone but it's now fixed

08/09/23, 8:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good morning*
I hope this message finds you in high spirits. I want to begin by sharing my excitement about the recent orientation program we organised. Meeting all the students in person was a truly delightful experience. It's been a journey of 7-8 months of staying in touch, and finally having the opportunity to meet face-to-face added a whole new dimension to our connection.
_*I can't express how much I'm looking forward to the day when we can meet in person as well. That moment will surely be something special.*_

Now, let's seize the day and dive into our session. Are you all ready?
08/09/23, 8:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you shared the mail Priscillar?
08/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Very true ,it will be a special moment,we haven't sent the mail but will do so soon, will let you know
14/09/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Priscillar, 
How are you doing? It has been quite a while since we have had a proper detailed conversation. I am bothered that you will be left behind from the rest of the students so if you are facing any challenges then I would really appreciate it if you come to me and let me know. 

I am here to help you and take out the solution in the best way possible. So, what is actually stopping you from taking one hour in a day out for your sessions? Please feel free to discuss them with me.
15/09/23, 9:47 am - +263 77 807 4436: Good morning,we managed to send the email on Monday l am sorry for the delay we were having electricity problems
15/09/23, 10:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 10:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 807 4436: Since Priscillar is at school l can do the sessions on her behalf,preferable Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday 1.30 pm to 2.30
18/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 807 4436: I am ready but l did not see the text on time because of poor network
19/09/23, 11:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning*

09/10/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.

Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
09/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Thank you very much for the video, l have learnt a lot from it .it has also made me aware of some of the challenges that may be faced by students learning  abroad

Are you ready?
12/10/23, 1:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263778074436 @263780967585 
I trust you're in good health. 

Is it possible for us to commence our session now?
12/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Good afternoon,how are you,yes it is possible
12/10/23, 1:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
12/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Welcome 🙏🙏
12/10/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
12/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Thank you very much ,it's pleasing to hear that.you are doing a great job
12/10/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 

Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
12/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Thank you very much,it's pleasing to connect with her
12/10/23, 2:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
12/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Its fine thank you
12/10/23, 3:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 807 4436: It is fine
12/10/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Priscillar to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
12/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 807 4436: I understand the procedure but it's unfortunate that Priscillar is at a boarding school where they are not allowed to have phones,she will be available on 17 November after sitting fo her examinations
13/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 807 4436: It is very fine thank you
13/10/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
May I know that are you available for the session now?
13/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Yes l am available
13/10/23, 1:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once Priscillar forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough. <This message was edited>

16/10/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Priscillar and Parents* @263780967585 @263778074436 
I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
16/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 807 4436: Thank you very much for the newsletter we will learn a lot from it
16/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 807 4436: I agree with the plan

It has been a while since we have connnected and I can see that you have not even replied to my above message. I hope everything is alright. 

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *Priscillar*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that.
18/10/23, 10:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In light of the circumstances, I am eager to go the extra mile to ensure that *Priscillar* remains on par with fellow students. *I'd like to propose scheduling a session with you on Saturday, running from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.*
Kindly confirm your availability so that I can arrange the session accordingly.
18/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 807 4436: I am very sorry for not responding to the above text,l typed the response but l don't know what happens,l have just noticed that l did not send it

21/10/23, 5:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
21/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 807 4436: It is very fine
21/10/23, 6:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
