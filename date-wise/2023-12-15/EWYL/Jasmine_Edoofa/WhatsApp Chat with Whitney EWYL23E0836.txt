20/11/23, 9:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Ideally, our initial orientation involves a comprehensive discussion with students about the mission and vision of the EWYL PROGRAM, followed by a detailed discussion of the various projects. 

However, since Whitney is not available for morning sessions, we will conduct a brief orientation with you. We will provide you with an overview of the program during this short session. We kindly request that you share this information with Whitney or ask her to review the conversation at her earliest convenience. Our full initial orientation process typically spans 2-3 days. May I know if will you be able to attend the session for the next 3 days?

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.

Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Not quite sure about those two objectives

20/11/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Whitney is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.

22/11/23, 6:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Whitney’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that her academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
22/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Well received...
22/11/23, 6:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
22/11/23, 6:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

22/11/23, 7:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options. First of all, I would like to know if is Whiteny available for the sessions that will be held twice a week.
22/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 374 9598: They are closing the schools on the 1st of December so from there she will be able to attend the session
22/11/23, 7:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to draft a mail on behalf of Whitney to me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because  _  from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Jasmine as soon as I get over with my school.

 Once you are done, kindly let me know so that I can confirm.
22/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 374 9598: Does this mean that l as a parent l won't stand on behalf of her on her absence
22/11/23, 7:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I've finished the initial orientation with you. Now, as we're gearing up for the Earn While You Learn Program, I'd like Whitney to be involved. Since I'll be sharing lessons and activities weekly, it's crucial that she reads and learns from them. Without her active participation, I don't believe it will fulfill its purpose. I trust you comprehend the importance of this
