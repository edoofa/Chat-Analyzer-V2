*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️

29/08/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

09/10/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Dear Taonga_*,
I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I understand the challenges you face with classes, tests, and assignments that can make our meetings difficult.

To provide more flexibility:
*1. We will now have our video calls on alternate Saturdays.*
*2. We'll also connect on alternate Wednesdays through WhatsApp for more accessible interactions in sessions.*
09/10/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it more clear -
*First Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday 
*Next Week*: Call on Saturday 
*Next Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday and so on.

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile. I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
09/10/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know is the schedule is crystal clear to you. If not, feel free to discuss.
09/10/23, 4:11 pm - +260 96 9697706: It's clear
10/10/23, 2:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, ⭐
_*SESSION TIME FOR TOMORROW here on the EWYL GROUP- 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm*_
Make sure you are present and please acknowledge your availability.
11/10/23, 3:37 pm - +260 96 9697706: Yes I am
11/10/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us don't have a good understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, we expect that the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
11/10/23, 3:39 pm - +260 96 9697706: Yes I do
11/10/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 3:41 pm - +260 96 9697706: We are
11/10/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, the purpose behind creating this video is to ensure that you provide accurate and precise information to the students. Once you submit the video to me, I'll review and approve it. After that, you can share your video with the students. Does this clarify things for you?
11/10/23, 3:47 pm - +260 96 9697706: Yes it does
11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - +260 96 9697706: I don't think I can do it by tomorrow
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: But you have to submit the video by 13th.
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - +260 96 9697706: I will

I want you to make the video and submit it to me by Tomorrow. Is that okay?

25/11/23, 1:29 pm - +260 96 9697706: From the last Wednesday wisdom, I understood that The power of competitive spirit is truly remarkable. When we embrace competition, it can serve as a catalyst for growth and success. It pushes us out of our comfort zones, encourages us to set higher goals, and motivates us to work harder to achieve them. Competition fosters innovation and creativity, as we strive to find new and better ways to outperform our rivals. It also teaches us important life skills such as resilience, perseverance, and teamwork. So, we can harness the power of competitive spirit and use it to fuel our personal and professional growth. With the right mindset and determination, we can achieve incredible things.
25/11/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am truly delighted to hear that you resonated with the recent Wednesday wisdom on the remarkable power of the competitive spirit.

1. You have become eligible for the grant as of November and it is something really big, however, I want to ask you what extraordinary you wish to do for December to sustain where you are and achieve something even bigger?
2. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that and it is the primary goal that I have for you. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
3. I sincerely think we both are a great team and I want to know the key areas that you have identified for yourself after reflecting on your performance until now, where you need more assistance from my end?

When people hear that it isn't fully funded they stop replying.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.
