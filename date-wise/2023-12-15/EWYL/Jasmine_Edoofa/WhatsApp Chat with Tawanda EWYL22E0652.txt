I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Jasmine your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Jasmine's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

06/12/23, 8:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
06/12/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 738 8531: For now I'm satisfied unless  there something else that is crucial that I have to know ?
06/12/23, 8:59 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
06/12/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 738 8531: Okay I understand, but in any case ,is it possible if we start with project 3 and return to project 2

08/12/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
08/12/23, 8:40 am - +263 77 738 8531: I'm coping 👌
08/12/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
08/12/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _Through WhatsApp community groups_

Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
08/12/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 738 8531: Okay I'll get to it
08/12/23, 9:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio, Tawanda?
08/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 738 8531: Im going through it
08/12/23, 9:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay
08/12/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 738 8531: U should create a WhatsApp group to link my different  friends and people that will be interested in the Program  so in this group I should inform them about edoofa I should also out you in the group though you won't be participating much you will be just advising and observing what I say as I explain to the people
08/12/23, 9:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am impressed with your understanding.
08/12/23, 9:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
08/12/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. As the weekend is approaching, I would want you to take a break, relax a bit, and get all charged up for the next week.
