As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

So Patience has just briefed me about your discussion with her about the Community Building Project.
She told me that If she tells someone about edoofa and joins she's nolonger getting the $20 or $25 per student,  rather she's now getting 💰$300 per student and the breakdown is now as follows 

If the student pays the enrollment fee of $350 he'll get the first 💰$100

And then if the student pays the Registration fee she'll get another 💰$100

And Finally when the student arrives in India she'll get another 💰$100  and this is the 💰$300 plan for the Community Building Project 
Thank you

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

14/12/23, 12:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Patience,*

I trust you're doing well. It was disheartening not to see you on the call yesterday. I want to emphasize that our meetings occur just once a week, and yesterday's call was scheduled for only 30 minutes. I believe it's reasonable to allocate at least 30 minutes from your week.
Moreover, I've noticed your absence from several recent sessions, and it's raising concerns about your commitment to the EWYL Program and earning credits. 

Do you want me to assume that you may not be as serious about it?
