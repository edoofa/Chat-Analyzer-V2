17/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 854 1770: Yes l am
17/08/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 854 1770: Well explained màm. Thank you
17/08/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
17/08/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 854 1770: No Màam
17/08/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
17/08/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 854 1770: That's wonderful. I am glad to hear these great news 😊
17/08/23, 4:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
17/08/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 854 1770: Alright Ma'am. Let me inform them
17/08/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
17/08/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 854 1770: Can you explain number 1.
17/08/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: See, there are two things
17/08/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You earn Scholarship credits by working in the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM. 
Now, when ever you are supposed to pay the fee. We will see that your Scholarship Credits are more or the Grant amount.
Whichever will be higher you can use that to lessen your fee.
17/08/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 854 1770: Alright. That means I should use one of these two right. If l use the grant then the credits would not be added right?
18/08/23, 6:16 am - +263 77 353 1456: l have read and understood about the grant. I am glad that my daughter is doing well that she deserves it. I agree with the terms and conditions on it. I will definitely sign it. Thank you Ms Jasmine

18/10/23, 1:55 pm - +91 77197 22701: Wooow that's wonderful. Felix Baumgartner's attempt is a great inspirational story. I learnt that l should have courage and confident enough to be the first one to do new things even if it sounds impossible. There's only one way to extract the best out of myself is to go beyond the limits.
18/10/23, 1:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, His feat clearly demonstrates the incredible heights that can be reached when one possesses the courage to dream big and the ambition to pursue those dreams. Right?
18/10/23, 2:02 pm - +91 77197 22701: Yes, absolutely Ma'am
18/10/23, 2:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, So how's college, Progress? Are you keeping up well with your classmates and academics?
18/10/23, 2:08 pm - +91 77197 22701: Yes Ma'am. I am happy that l managed to pass all my exams. Everything is just good and l also made Indian friends. I am just worried about one thing , they did not finalise about my Program yet.
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you discussed the same with Mr. Rithvik?
18/10/23, 2:17 pm - +91 77197 22701: Yes, he said he will talk to Mr Sandeep but there's no a clear reply yet. It's now 5 weeks and they keep saying that I should come after 3 or 5 days. I am now tired of it😌.
18/10/23, 2:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, now that you've shared it with me, don't worry, it won't be a lengthy process.
18/10/23, 2:25 pm - +91 77197 22701: Alright Ma'am

18/10/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now, I would like to ask if you are in the loop about the WhatsApp group, "Career Launchpad"? 🚀 This group is an absolute game-changer, and it's packed with fantastic opportunities waiting just for you!


Have you explored the boundless potential this group offers? It's not just a group; it's your personal launchpad to success, loaded with resources, insights, and connections that can supercharge your career journey! 🌟

18/10/23, 3:45 pm - +91 77197 22701: I am glad to be informed 🥰
18/10/23, 3:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now, I'd like to discuss our "Star of the Month" initiative, which is our $300 plan. Let me clarify why we introduced this plan. It's designed to help you achieve maximum results with minimal effort.
18/10/23, 3:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us need a better understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
18/10/23, 3:56 pm - +91 77197 22701: Yes Ma'am
18/10/23, 4:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
Are we both on the same page?
18/10/23, 4:16 pm - +91 77197 22701: Alright Ma'am. I understand
18/10/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 21-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Saturday. Will you be able to do that?

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

24/11/23, 10:52 am - +91 77197 22701: The power of competitive spirit. A catalyst for growth and success.

The competitive edge.
When the desire to outperform others becomes a driving force it creates a culture of excellence. Apple's founder, Steve Jobs, was renowned for his relentless pursuit of excellence and innovation. Apple's success story is a testament of the company's competitive spirit demonstrated through products like iPhone, iPad and MacBook.

Fostering innovation.
Competitive breeds innovation as the desire to to stay ahead compels individuals and organisations to think outside the box.

To examplify, Tesla's competitive spirit goes beyond making electric cars but it goes beyond space exploration and artificial intelligence.

Economic Growth.
On economic level, nations that embrace a competitive spirit experience growth and development such as China. China transformed itself from a primary agrarian society into the world's second's largest economy.

Overcoming challenges.
A competitive spirit gives individuals the resilience to overcome challenges. For example Michael Jordan was widely known as the best basketball player. Although there were numerous setbacks including being cut from his high school basketball team,  his competitive spirit and determination drove him to work harder.
24/11/23, 10:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Your exploration of the power of competitive spirit is well-articulated and insightful. 
Keep it up Progress
24/11/23, 11:10 am - +91 77197 22701: Thank you Ma'am

25/11/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_
I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

09/12/23, 7:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 7:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 9:38 am - +91 77197 22701: Ok Ma'am
09/12/23, 9:38 am - +91 77197 22701: Which grant are you talking about Ma'am?
09/12/23, 9:41 am - +91 77197 22701: Ma'am can you please explain
09/12/23, 9:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening! Let me clarify the situation. There are two distinct aspects:

$1. *300 Plan for Community Building*: You had the chance to earn $300 by working on the Community Building project. The more effort she puts in, the more credits you can earn.

2. *21-Day Grant Challenge*: When you were back home, you participated in a grant challenge that lasted for 21 days. Following the grant, certain terms and conditions were outlined in the grant letter. One condition specified that you must maintain attendance of more than 75% in both the EWYL sessions and webinars. Unfortunately, you had not met this requirement until November. As a result, you are currently ineligible for the grant.
09/12/23, 9:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
