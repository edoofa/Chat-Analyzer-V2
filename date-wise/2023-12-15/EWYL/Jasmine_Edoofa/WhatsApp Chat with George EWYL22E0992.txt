15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 691 4904: Good morning Ma'am
15/09/23, 9:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 691 4904: Thank you Ma'am
15/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 691 4904: Saturday ma'am
11/10/23, 1:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
I hope you are doing well. 

It is time for the session. Are you ready?
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 487 1749: Yes
12/10/23, 1:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I trust you're in good health. 

Is it possible for us to commence our session now?
12/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 487 1749: Yes
12/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 487 1749: Afternoon let's proceed
12/10/23, 2:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
12/10/23, 2:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 487 1749: Nice to meet Ms Jasmjne
12/10/23, 2:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.

Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 487 1749: Yes I understand
12/10/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 487 1749: Let's proceed am following
12/10/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 487 1749: Yes I understand...but I have a question
12/10/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Please
12/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 487 1749: what if the student does not do the EWYL program
12/10/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, George, there is an option available. However, if someone chooses to go down that path, it comes with a significant consequence: all the valuable benefits associated with the Earn While You Learn program will be forfeited. This includes the opportunity to acquire 21st-century job skills, exposure through webinars and industrial visits in India, and the chance to self-finance your education. All of these advantages would be lost.

I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?

It has been a while since we have had a quality conversation.

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *George*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that. <This message was edited>
