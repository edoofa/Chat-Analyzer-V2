29/08/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

This scholarship not only makes quality education accessible but also equips students with essential skills for a successful future in an increasingly competitive world. I firmly believe that your students should have access to similar life-changing opportunities. By offering such opportunities, we can empower them to realize their dreams and provide them with the tools they need to succeed.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you.
03/10/23, 3:50 pm - +27 83 470 2027: As a former Rio Tinto Student I saw it fit that other students should benefit from this scholarship. Let me know your thoughts ndini weeny Abraham Mukokanduku
03/10/23, 3:50 pm - +27 83 470 2027: Takambotaura pafoni about the Edoofa Program so neat nduye ndiite official communication
03/10/23, 3:51 pm - +27 83 470 2027: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 3:51 pm - +27 83 470 2027: Had to say some words in my language so they can see its not a scam
03/10/23, 4:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Now it is time for me to wrap up but we will discuss more about this in our session tomorrow. 
Take Care
03/10/23, 4:33 pm - +27 83 470 2027: Thanks for your patience
04/10/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Tanatswa
How are you doing?
04/10/23, 12:43 pm - +27 83 470 2027: Afternoon 
I was driving couldn’t connect
05/10/23, 8:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Morning Tanatswa*_
I hope you are doing fine. Since we were unable to have our session yesterday. I would want us to start early today. So, are you ready for the session?
05/10/23, 8:33 am - +27 83 470 2027: Morning 
Yes am ready
05/10/23, 8:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So last time we were discussing about Project 3. Do you remember?
05/10/23, 8:34 am - +27 83 470 2027: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 8:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, So we were talking about the messages and information that you can use while talking to the headmaster.
05/10/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Tanatswa, May I know that are you here?
05/10/23, 8:43 am - +27 83 470 2027: Yes exactly
05/10/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
05/10/23, 8:44 am - +27 83 470 2027: The fees are around 565usd
05/10/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I am just telling you that when the school fees is less than 100$, then we don't do the call.
05/10/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
05/10/23, 9:09 am - +27 83 470 2027: Okay noted item 2 can be done
05/10/23, 9:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Tanatswa- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
