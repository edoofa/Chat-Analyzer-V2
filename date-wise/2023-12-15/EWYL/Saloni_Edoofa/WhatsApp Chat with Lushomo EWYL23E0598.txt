21/09/23, 10:58 am - Look Good and Feel Good: Lushomo will not be available for any of these. She is in boarding school far away from home.

04/10/23, 11:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know the reason of the delay in attending the session?
04/10/23, 11:11 am - Look Good and Feel Good: The problem is sometimes the time confuses me. Currently am not in Zambia, am in India. So I miscalculated the time.
04/10/23, 11:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am sorry, I just failed to understand it. May I know how come you are in India since you are expected to come next year?
04/10/23, 11:17 am - Look Good and Feel Good: My dear I told you that Lushomo is at school in boarding in Zambia. I am the mother to Lushomo  I  am just representing her in these programs. I am in India because I escorted my sister for medical attention.
04/10/23, 11:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I remember you told me that Lushomo is in boarding school but never mentioned about your availability in India.
04/10/23, 11:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, now as per Indian time, tomorrow we will have the session from 04:00-05:00 PM IST.

Let's begin with our session📍
05/10/23, 12:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: @260977117478
05/10/23, 12:42 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Yes please
05/10/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Lushomo will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
05/10/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 7:07 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Good evening,  I have read the document.  Wao!! I like these projects. This is a great initiative.
09/10/23, 8:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?
09/10/23, 8:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad that you have liked it, we will soon discuss this in our session.
09/10/23, 8:18 am - Look Good and Feel Good: 🙏🙏🙏
09/10/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our sessions?
09/10/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: @260977117478
09/10/23, 1:12 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Sure
09/10/23, 1:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Lushomo can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 1:21 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Yes.
09/10/23, 1:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
09/10/23, 1:24 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Okay
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
09/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
09/10/23, 1:47 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: Okay, understood.  So what am I supposed to do at this point?
09/10/23, 1:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to do this.
17/10/23, 8:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day to our proud edoofian and parents!

I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read the above-shared newsletter.
Even parents can do it on behalf of the student.
17/10/23, 8:22 am - Look Good and Feel Good: Okay thanks, will do so.
17/10/23, 8:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Waiting for the same.
17/10/23, 9:39 am - Look Good and Feel Good: Good morning, I have read the newsletter. I really love the quotes given in there especially the first one which says don't worry about being successful but put in work first and success will follow. This is very true, you need to add value first, you need to give out first before you expect a return. I have learnt about this principle and also about the importance of having a clear goal from the book I am reading which is entitled "Think and grow rich."

Thanks to Edoofa, the students under your care are learning the real stuff which will really empower them in life.
17/10/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: I wholeheartedly thank you for investing your valuable time in perusing our newsletter. Just as you've shown your support, we are committed to continuously delivering extraordinary newsletters from our side. Your engagement and enthusiasm are truly inspiring!

17/10/23, 10:04 am - Look Good and Feel Good: 🙏🙏🙏
26/10/23, 5:50 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: These similarities just show that human beings are all one. It doesn't matter where one comes from. The underlying factor is that we are one people and all created in the image of God.
27/10/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Waiting for this message
27/10/23, 12:52 pm - Look Good and Feel Good: 🙏🙏🙏

07/12/23, 10:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Lushomo, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
07/12/23, 10:46 am - +260 97 6560282: Tomorrow I will be early

07/12/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any questions about this, Lushomo? I can help you.
07/12/23, 10:50 am - +260 97 6560282: Ok madam understood.....today I am going to begin searching for companies
07/12/23, 10:51 am - +260 97 6560282: For now I don't have any
07/12/23, 10:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
07/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Lushomo, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Lushomo!

08/12/23, 10:27 am - +260 97 6560282: Ok madam😊
08/12/23, 10:28 am - +260 97 6560282: Ok madam understood
08/12/23, 10:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
08/12/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
08/12/23, 10:36 am - +260 97 6560282: Okay
08/12/23, 10:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Lushomo/Saloni/8DEC2023*
08/12/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
08/12/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
08/12/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
08/12/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
08/12/23, 10:58 am - +260 97 6560282: Ok I will go through everything
08/12/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 10:00-11:00 AM 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then, have a great weekend🌺
08/12/23, 11:29 am - +260 97 6560282: Alright thanks you too
11/12/23, 7:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

12/12/23, 11:00 am - +260 97 6560282: Yes please
12/12/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 11:02 am - +260 97 6560282: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 11:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 10:00-11:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
12/12/23, 11:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: No, you have to form just one group.
13/12/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Lushomo,
How are you doing?

I apologize for the delay in my response. I was caught up in an urgent meeting that required my immediate attention. I regret any inconvenience this may have caused. 
We will continue tomorrow in the slot 10:00-11:00 AM⏳
13/12/23, 12:20 pm - +260 97 6560282: Ok ...it's fine madam. understood 😁 
See you tomorrow then
14/12/23, 10:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Lushomo,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
14/12/23, 10:13 am - Look Good and Feel Good: Yes madam
14/12/23, 10:13 am - Look Good and Feel Good: We may begin
14/12/23, 10:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
14/12/23, 10:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zambia*, where tuition fees range from ZKW 16,000 to ZWL 21,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K5000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K1200 per month↗
14/12/23, 10:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: On average, parents in Zambia spend between ZKW 35,000 and ZKW 40,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course💥
14/12/23, 10:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 10:27 am - +260 97 6560282: Ok let me just go through
14/12/23, 10:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you go through it, do let me know.
14/12/23, 11:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled about our upcoming session starting on Monday since I will be unavailable tomorrow due to a prior meeting also no sessions are held on Saturday and Sunday. During the next three days, I have an exciting and creative task for you🎭, and you can choose from three options:
14/12/23, 11:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Option A*: Design a captivating poster that visually represents your current position in terms of your goals and illustrates where you aspire to be with the support of Edoofa📈

OR

*Option B*: If you've been involved in any community-building projects, create a poster highlighting your experiences and discussing Edoofa's role in these initiatives🎯🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

OR

*Option C*: Produce a video detailing your journey so far, starting from the counseling phase, progressing through the admission process, and concluding with your encounters with me as part of the EWYL Department📽️

I am eager to see your response and the creative output from your chosen option. Looking forward to our session on Monday.
