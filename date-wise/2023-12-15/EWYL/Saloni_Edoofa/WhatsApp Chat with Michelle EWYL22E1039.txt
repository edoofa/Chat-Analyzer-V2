Well they say the way to the heart is through the stomach! 
Food has the power to bring people together, to create memories, and to forge lasting bonds. It can be a way to show love and appreciation, and it can bring comfort and joy. It is often a central part of special occasions and family gatherings.
I therefore suggest apart from the perfect orientation above, I am more than eager to get to know the food culture and tastes of your home country!
I'm looking forward to that too!😂
08/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 305 5181: But most importantly, I'm really looking forward to the messages from my  mentor and the orientors in person to guide us through our academic journey

11/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 305 5181: Noted!
11/12/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
11/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 305 5181: I'm following
11/12/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
11/12/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Michelle/Saloni/11DEC2023*
11/12/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
11/12/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
11/12/23, 9:40 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
11/12/23, 9:40 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
11/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 305 5181: It's clear
I'll surely ask if I have any questions
11/12/23, 9:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you have learned from the process?
11/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 305 5181: You earn 20 dollars for every student enrolled
And 30 dollars upon completion of admission formalities
And the best way to do this creating a WhatsApp group
Finding the right student is also crucial
11/12/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 09:00-10:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
12/12/23, 7:57 am - +263 77 305 5181: Good morning Ms Saloni. 
My apologies, I don't think I'll be able to make it for our 9 to 10 am session. Is it possible to reschedule it to any other day and time of your choice?
12/12/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,
How are you?

May we have the session from 10-11 AM?
12/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 305 5181: Yes
That's possible
12/12/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Do you want the session time to change just for today or for all our coming days?
12/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 305 5181: I would like the session time to remain the same (from 9am to 10am) for all our coming days. Today was just an exception
12/12/23, 9:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay Michelle, no worries.
12/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 305 5181: Im ready for my session
12/12/23, 10:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have got the just of it.
12/12/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/12/23, 10:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
12/12/23, 10:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

12/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 305 5181: Im following
12/12/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

12/12/23, 10:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Michelle. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
12/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 305 5181: As for now I dont have any
