10/08/23, 11:10 am - +263 71 931 0305: The Founder Mr Angad Singh is encouraging us the edoofian students to be hard workers and the future is in our hand.The teacher opens the door but we must enter our selfs which means l must work hard in order for me to enter through the door if l don’t work hard l will remain on the door steps.When we are setting our goals if they are big goals we need to break them into smaller goals because if we try to archive big goals it will be difficult and we will be demotivated leading to failure. Small steps help us develop good habits and builds a strong foundation for success.
I also liked the Hall Inspiration words from Praise who was aging us to think out side our comfort zone and do wonders . She said you can archive anything as long as you set a goal for it and make it be your target to complete it.It only needs us to put effort for our goals to be successful.
10/08/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Good afternoon

17/08/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have said it correctly, let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
17/08/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
17/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay well understood
18/08/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

23/08/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/08/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.

We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

We will continue tomorrow in the slot 09:00-10:00 AM.
14/12/23, 9:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Arthur,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
14/12/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 931 0305: Am fine thanks and how are you
14/12/23, 9:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing fantastic, thank you!
14/12/23, 9:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: Have you understood till here?
14/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 931 0305: Yes l have
14/12/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
14/12/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Mentor-  *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ARTHUR/Saloni/14DEC2023*
14/12/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
14/12/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
14/12/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
14/12/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
14/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
14/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
14/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 931 0305: Okay noted
14/12/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 931 0305: So in the group l create l also add you as my mentor right
14/12/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 931 0305: Well understood
14/12/23, 9:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you have to add me as well.
14/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
14/12/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
14/12/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
14/12/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
14/12/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
14/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
14/12/23, 9:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
14/12/23, 9:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 931 0305: The last project is about me reaching out to the schools in my region educating them about Edoofa.Having a conversation with the head master of the school telling them about why l joined Edoofa and the reason why l wish all students must join to archive their goals
14/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
14/12/23, 9:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Arthur. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
14/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 71 931 0305: At the moment no well understood
