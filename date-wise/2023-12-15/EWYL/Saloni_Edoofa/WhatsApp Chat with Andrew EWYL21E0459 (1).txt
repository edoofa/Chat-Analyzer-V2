Through this lesson, I learned that Video blogging, or vlogging, has transformed how we share stories and insights. With just a camera and a creative mind, individuals can transport audiences into their world, adding a visual and personal touch to their narratives. Vlogging blends entertainment, education, and authenticity, allowing creators to connect with viewers on a deeper level. From travel escapades to cooking tutorials, vlogging's dynamic nature captures attention, fostering a sense of community and fostering a global conversation through the power of visual storytelling.

In this session, I want to learn what all you grasped about *VIDEO BLOGGING* and yes, *PROJECT UPDATES*
14/08/23, 1:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details.

Let's set up a session on *16/08/2023 from 07:00-08:00 PM IST | 03:30-04:30 PM ZIMB TIME*  to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀 <This message was edited>

14/08/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 649 1882: Greetings of the day Ms Saloni. How's everything going with you?
14/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 649 1882: I'm so glad to receive this incredible news Ms Saloni. Let me go through the documents. I will be available to discuss the same with you my mentor. Thank you so much.

Hope you are well.

Final *grant discussion* will be done today on the EWYL Group from 07:00-08:00 PM IST | 03:30-04:30 PM CAT.

Please make sure you have read both the document carefully:

A. Grant Certificate 
B. FAQ
16/08/23, 1:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am happy to hear that!
16/08/23, 1:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
16/08/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 649 1882: Yes my mentor I had managed to go through both the documents and yes I do have some questions to ask.
16/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 649 1882: You are welcome.
16/08/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 649 1882: Ms Saloni may I know if you are available to discuss the Edoofa grant with me?
16/08/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have any concerns regarding the same?
16/08/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 649 1882: Well, let's say a student have received a 100%  scholarship both on tuition and accomodation right, so in the issue of an on campus student if they satisfy the grant availability criteria the grant can be used to offset accommodation fee so  can be the grant used to pay my accommodation since the university covered the same for me?
16/08/23, 4:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well Andrew, so far no student has been offered such a scholarship.
And to those students, we won't offer any grant.
16/08/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 649 1882: Another question is that my grant certificate states that I received the Edoofa grant totalling $600 right so how much will the grant pay as per my semester tuition fee?
16/08/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 649 1882: I'm the one who has been offered such a scholarship Ms Saloni. Let me show you my offer letter from the MNV university

I hope you're having a wonderful day.

I wanted to express how genuinely intrigued and excited I am after our Wednesday lesson. It was not just interesting but also incredibly amusing. As I delved into the material, I couldn't help but ponder my own hidden talents and how I might use them to bring smiles and magic into the lives of others. It's a thought that has been lingering in my mind ever since.

Now, I'm very curious about your talents, those unique gifts that undoubtedly define who you are. I'm eagerly anticipating hearing about them because I'm sure they're something special.

19/09/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 649 1882: *Saturday Activity*

 *Tip and strategies for exam preparation.*


Our mission in exam is not merely to survive, but to thrive and to do so with some passion ,some compassion, some style and some faith.

Here are some unique tips and strategies for exam preparation.

1) *Pray and Read*
A positive prayer causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events and outcomes. It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results.  I think it of paramount significant for students to pray before they begin to study. Prayer gives hope, confidence and faith that everything is possible. It makes everything easier even to the topics seems to be hard. If you continue to feed yourself from that food , God will assist you to read the areas that are likely to come in the examination. 

A heartfelt prayer gives faith that you are going to make it in your final exam. 

So I think is very important for students to pray about their examinations and not forgetting to read and have enough faith . It the glue of life . It's the most essential ingredient for a victorious life.
21/09/23, 10:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Andrew!

13/12/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofians, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Team EWYL
