I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in plans. Instead of having our session tomorrow, I will be conducting it today from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm. The reason for this change is that I'll be on leave tomorrow as my mother has come to town, and I'd like to spend some time with her.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

29/09/23, 12:05 pm - +91 78273 08969: Dear Alson,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

Starting with the corporate alliance project , this is when l will be searching for large scale organization inwhich l will identify decision makers in those organisations and link them with the Edoofa .
I will be given scholarship credits for each and every step of the way .
Coming to Community building , this is where l will approach school friends and relatives and propose to them about the Edoofa and also to persuade them to fit in the program . The last one is African schools education reform mission in which l will be engaging to schools and meet with the decision makers so that they partner with the Edoofa and plan for a meeting for the two .
