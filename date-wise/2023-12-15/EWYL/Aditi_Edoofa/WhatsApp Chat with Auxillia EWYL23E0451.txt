Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest.

09/10/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am well, Thanks for asking.

09/10/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 392 5961: Yes please .
09/10/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
09/10/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 392 5961: *EWYL* , yes I understand but *two key objectives* no .
09/10/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay,  Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
09/10/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
09/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 392 5961: I have understood maam
09/10/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
09/10/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 392 5961: So nice to know them .
09/10/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you.
09/10/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
09/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 392 5961: Yes ma'am.
09/10/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

18/10/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 392 5961: Yes maam
18/10/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that you have crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
18/10/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 392 5961: I'm listening maam
18/10/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you were contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
18/10/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 392 5961: Yes maam
18/10/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries
18/10/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 392 5961: Oky ma'am.

18/10/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
18/10/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
18/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 392 5961: You mean here , Everytime before the lesson .
18/10/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: Auxillia, on this EWYL Line.
18/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 392 5961: Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am Kudzai Auxilia Pick  and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is  Auxilia EWYL23E0451 .
18/10/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Auxillia, you have to send this message here.
18/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 392 5961: I am a proud EDOOFIAN .
18/10/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Auxillia, I am repeating myself again, that you have to send the above messages on the EWYL Line *NOT* the EWYL Group.
18/10/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 392 5961: Alright ma'am I have understood ma'am...I'm sorry
18/10/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: It's aright!
18/10/23, 9:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: @263783925961 I've noticed that you've been leaving my messages on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.


If you're facing challenges or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Our communication should be a two-way street, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
18/10/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 392 5961: So now should I message the line
18/10/23, 9:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you may.
18/10/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 392 5961: I'm sorry ma'am
18/10/23, 9:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: And keep these pointers in mind.
18/10/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 392 5961: Alright maam
18/10/23, 9:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Since you will be busy with your job, make sure that you share the lesson and activity before the session, okay?
18/10/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 392 5961: Oky ma'am , you mean on the project
18/10/23, 9:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: Auxillia, first off please go through our conversation again I am talking about the Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity that you would be receiving according to the program structure.
Here I am reiterating the program structure to clear the confusion.
18/10/23, 9:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: Our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
18/10/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 392 5961: Alright  maam
19/10/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good morning! ☀️
May your day be filled with positivity, productivity, and moments of joy.

Are you ready to begin today's session?
19/10/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 392 5961: Good morning ma'am
19/10/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
19/10/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 392 5961: Yes ma'am.
19/10/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
19/10/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 392 5961: Counselors plays a role in highlighting a student about Edoofa . Admission Officers helps a student with the admission. The mentor now is there to guide you about your career throughout .
19/10/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's correct!
19/10/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding.
Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
19/10/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries
19/10/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 392 5961: Yes maam
19/10/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Auxillia, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions.
19/10/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 392 5961: Ma'am sorry explain to me about EWLY Line , I really do not understand it
19/10/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so basically EWYL Line is where we will be connecting from now on.
19/10/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 392 5961: Alright ma'am thank you .
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: You have to message on this, we call it the EWYL Line.
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line. <This message was edited>

I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
14/11/23, 10:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
Hope you are well

I hope you enjoyed your Diwali break, may I know what you learned about Diwali's significance also do share the picture of the activity with me on the EWYL Line.🤩
15/11/23, 10:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
I trust this message finds you in high spirits! 😊 I wanted to touch base regarding our missed session on Monday, and I hope you had a fantastic Diwali break.

Given the festive spirit, it seems our schedules got a bit tangled. No worries at all! How about we reschedule our session today between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM? 
Looking forward to connecting and picking up where we left off!
