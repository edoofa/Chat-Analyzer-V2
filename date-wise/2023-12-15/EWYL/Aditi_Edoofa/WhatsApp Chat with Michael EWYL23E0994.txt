13/12/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
13/12/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 355 8896: What are the two objectives
13/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
13/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
13/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 355 8896: So what kind of work do your Edoofians do to earn maximum credits
13/12/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am happy to see your excitement, have some patience we will discuss everything in our sessions one by one.
13/12/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
13/12/23, 9:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session tomorrow onwards from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
13/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 355 8896: I look forward to it
13/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 355 8896: Yes I will try my best
13/12/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
That would be highly appreciated!
14/12/23, 8:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning🌅
Hope you are doing well.

Let's dive into today's session🚀
14/12/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 355 8896: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 355 8896: Good morning
14/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: So beginning today's session I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
14/12/23, 9:00 am - +263 71 355 8896: Yes. It does
14/12/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
14/12/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 355 8896: I have read both of them. I must say they are quite informative
14/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
14/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 355 8896: Yes I noticed the Hall of Inspiration. And it's quite an honor
14/12/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
14/12/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
14/12/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 355 8896: It Sounds great and exciting
14/12/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day,I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.*Are you ready for the questions?*
14/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 355 8896: Yes go ahead please
