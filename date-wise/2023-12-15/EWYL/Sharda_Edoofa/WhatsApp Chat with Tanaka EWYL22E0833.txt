15/09/23, 9:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tanaka

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 633 1349: Greetings, lam doing well

21/09/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Tanaka’S EWYL journey:
21/09/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure Tanaka is given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
21/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 849 9737: For sure that is what iam what we are fighting for as Tanaka's parents. Thank you for the encouraging words
21/09/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Tanaka will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
21/09/23, 2:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please!

21/09/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits

2. Do not miss the EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency

3. Ask for support, share the challenges and the things one is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make the mentor trust the student fully
21/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 849 9737: Will comply with all these demands inorder to meet the required standards.

You are most welcome.

As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:

Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room
Now, what does this mean to you?
Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.

So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.

Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!

Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
