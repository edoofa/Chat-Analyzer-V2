Firstly is the application stage... following this is when one gets in touch with career counselors through one on one sessions... after this... one is expected to pass the eligiblity check interview at by the edoofa program directors and academic board... once cleared one will receive an acceptance letter... after receiving the acceptance letter the student gets in touch with the admissions team and a statement of purpose is drawn out and University admission is finalized all while working with the EWYL mentors to earn credits... lastly is the preparation to travel which can be assisted by the admissions team

4. The testimonial I'll be writing about is from Prince Dhilawayo a Zimbabwean who's been in India for two months (as per the video)... he strongly appreciates the edoofa team for taking him thus far and also appreciates the country and it's education system

12/12/23, 8:51 am - +260 97 8133366: What is an "MOU" ❓
12/12/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: An MOU stands for "Memorandum of Understanding." It's a formal document that outlines the terms and details of an agreement between two or more parties.
12/12/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Imagine you and a friend want to work on a project together. You sit down and discuss all the important details: what each of you will contribute, how you'll share responsibilities, and any specific rules you want to set. To make sure everyone is on the same page, you decide to write all these things down in a special document. That document is like a roadmap for your project, helping you remember what everyone agreed upon.
12/12/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: In the adult world, when companies, organizations, or even countries want to work together or collaborate on something, they use something similar – an MOU. It's a way to make sure everyone involved understands their roles, responsibilities, and the terms of their partnership. It's not a legally binding contract like a formal agreement, but it shows that everyone is committed to working together in a certain way.
12/12/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: So, in a nutshell, an MOU is like a friendly agreement on paper that helps people and organizations work together smoothly by putting their plans and expectations in writing.
12/12/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Is that clear Faith??
12/12/23, 8:58 am - +260 97 8133366: It is yes.... Thank you
12/12/23, 9:01 am - +260 97 8133366: Am I supposed to fill this in❓
12/12/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, but you can do that later on too.
12/12/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
12/12/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
12/12/23, 9:03 am - +260 97 8133366: Okay... I'll do it later... I'm working on getting LinkedIn but my network is quite slow
12/12/23, 9:07 am - +260 97 8133366: Can I know why it's on hold❓
12/12/23, 9:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: It has been put on hold due to some recent developments t our end.
12/12/23, 9:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: We are done with Project 1.
12/12/23, 9:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let us now move to Project 2.

12/12/23, 9:42 am - +260 97 8133366: No problem... I'll let you know
12/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 8133366: The audio projects the project to be one that fosters a positive and cohesive community promoting social interaction and participation.... it helps one to develop persuasion skills and networking skills

12/12/23, 10:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project. Are you ready?

Subject Combination in Grade 12:-
Current Class ( Grade 11/ Grade 12/ Grade 12 Appeared):

I will be appearing for my Grade 12(Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
12/12/23, 11:20 am - +260 97 8133366: Thank you
12/12/23, 11:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)


Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
12/12/23, 11:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
12/12/23, 11:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 11:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/12/23, 11:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zambia*, where tuition fees range from ZKW 16,000 to ZWL 21,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K5000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K1200 per month↗

On average, parents in Zambia spend between ZKW 35,000 and ZKW 40,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course💥

*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zambia, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.*

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

12/12/23, 11:23 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
12/12/23, 11:24 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 11:24 am - Sharda Edoofa: This is very valuable information that you can definitely use while communicating with the students. Do you agree?
12/12/23, 11:26 am - +260 97 8133366: I am in full agreement yes...but I don't think a WhatsApp group can work in my case... Because your team already went to my school so everyone who was interested in the program applied for it
12/12/23, 12:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Faith, this is understandable. But you can definitely add students who are not from your school. People who are in your contacts, people who are relatives or people who are from different schools.
12/12/23, 12:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let us now move to project 3.

'
14/12/23, 9:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.
14/12/23, 9:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: School Form

14/12/23, 9:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
14/12/23, 9:39 am - +260 97 8133366: Most schools do O-level... That's when the national exams are
14/12/23, 9:39 am - +260 97 8133366: As in... You want me to write the school I was at❓
14/12/23, 9:40 am - Sharda Edoofa: yes Faith
14/12/23, 9:43 am - +260 97 8133366: 1. Fatima Girls' Secondary School... Yes it is

2. First and foremost... An introduction and then how I got the edoofa scholarship...the program details... and my future plans 

3. The Copperbelt province
14/12/23, 10:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
14/12/23, 10:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
14/12/23, 10:52 am - +260 97 8133366: Yes I agree
14/12/23, 10:52 am - +260 97 8133366: Yes I'm ready

Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
14/12/23, 11:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Faith, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*
14/12/23, 11:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will help you out.
14/12/23, 11:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All. EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations.

14/12/23, 11:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

14/12/23, 11:21 am - +260 97 8133366: So all this information can be altered to add more emphasis yes❓
14/12/23, 12:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, of course Faith. Definitely this can be done.
14/12/23, 12:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
14/12/23, 12:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
