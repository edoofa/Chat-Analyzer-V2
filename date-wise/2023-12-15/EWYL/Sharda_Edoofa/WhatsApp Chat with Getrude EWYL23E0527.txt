25/08/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In this group, we have *Miss Deepali* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.

She is not online right now, but she will definitely be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
25/08/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
25/08/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 825 6111: Ok thankyou thankyou Ms Sharda
25/08/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 825 6111: Ok thankyou for the information
25/08/23, 3:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.

Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. from Monday to Friday*
25/08/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey
25/08/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.

2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.
25/08/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
25/08/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Now, I would like you to tell me about what you have understood from the Program Structure.
Please go ahead.*
25/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 825 6111: Ok you said that as for now we are maintaining the usual timetable but after we completed the current phase of learning about all the projects the timetable will change in the way that l will be meeting you two days a week either Monday and Tuesday or Thursday and Friday and l will be getting the lesson of the week known as the Wednesday Wisdom
25/08/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Good Job*, Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
25/08/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 3:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We've covered the fundamentals of the program, the key team members, and the program structure in today's session. Please review the newsletters we discussed today and we'll pick up from where we left off tomorrow. Before we end, I'd like to recognize your active participation, which has added value to our conversation. Our next session is at 02:00 pm on *Monday*, so please be on time.✨ 
Have a great day ahead.
25/08/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 825 6111: Ok thats awesome thanks

28/08/23, 2:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?

29/08/23, 3:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 3:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
29/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 825 6111: Wow ok Ms Sharda may your day tommorow be blessed  ...its my pleasure to know about this festival ...its so nice ..thankyu

A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session
Are you ready for it?
14/09/23, 2:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/09/23, 2:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, 
I hope you're doing well today. 
I noticed you have not been available for our sessions since last 3 days. 

May I know what is the challenge exactly?
20/09/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon, *Gertrude*

I hope that you are doing well. It has been a while since we last connected. 
I have been reminding you to come for the scheduled so that we can proceed with our scheduled sessions so that you don't miss out on the opportunities to earn scholarship credits and learn from the industrial academia that has been specifically curated for our Edoofians.

May I know what exactly is the challenge?
10/10/23, 10:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented Every Wednesday.

Every Wednesday, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. starting from tomorrow*
12/10/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, *Gertrude* and parents @27629873350 @27716825189 
I hope you are doing well.

I've observed that neither *Gertrude* nor parents have been available for the scheduled sessions, which are crucial to ensure *Gertrude* doesn't miss out on any learning opportunities. 
Kindly share the specific challenges you're facing so that I can provide the necessary assistance.
12/10/23, 2:06 pm - +27 62 987 3350: How are Ms Sharda the challenge we are having right now is we didn't finish to pay registration fee i am out of job also Gertrude's phone was not okay
12/10/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am doing well, dear parent @27629873350. Thank you for asking.
I am sorry to hear that you are out of employment. I am sure that it comes with a lot of uncertainty & challenges, considering Getrude would want to move to India next year for his higher education. 

May I know how are you planning to complete the formalities for Getrude in this case and if you had a chance to discuss the same with the admission officers? I am sure if you would have transparently shared the concerns, they would be more than willing to find alternate and feasible solutions for you. 

As EWYL program is also a crucial aid in helping you earn scholarship credits and reduce University/travel fees later on, you should be rest assured that if Getrude is able to work efficiently on the program, he would himself be sufficient to manage finances further.
12/10/23, 2:56 pm - +27 62 987 3350: Ok thank you for advising
12/10/23, 4:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome!
16/10/23, 3:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Warm Greetings, Gertrude!
I trust you are in good health

Since you mentioned about your challenges earlier, I wanted know if things got better by now.
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Gertrude
I hope you are doing really well.

I am aware of the ongoing examination, and I wish you all the very best for the same. Given that you will be keeping busy the examination I want you to complete the fast-track EWYL training session which will not take more than 2 days if attended regularly.
These sessions can also be attended by your parents on our behalf.

During these sessions, I will share a procedure through which we will be able to put your EWYL Program on hold and then we will resume it once your examinations will get over.

Do let me know if we can get started with the sessions from today onwards.
20/10/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning
