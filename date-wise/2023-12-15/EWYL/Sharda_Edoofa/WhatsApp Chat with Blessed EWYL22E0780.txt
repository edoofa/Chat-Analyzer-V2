03/08/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings and a lovely morning to you my dear student!
15/09/23, 9:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Blessed

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Every Wednesday, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. starting from tomorrow*
17/10/23, 1:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Blessed and parents 
I hope you are doing well.

I've observed that neither *Blessed* nor parents have been available for the scheduled sessions, which are crucial to ensure *Blessed* doesn't miss out on any learning opportunities. 
Kindly share the specific challenges you're facing so that I can provide the necessary assistance.
18/10/23, 2:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Blessed
I hope you are doing really well.

I am aware of the ongoing examination, and I wish you all the very best for the same. Given that you will be keeping busy the examination I want you to complete the fast-track EWYL training session which will not take more than 2 days if attended regularly.
These sessions can also be attended by your parents on our behalf.

During these sessions, I will share a procedure through which we will be able to put your EWYL Program on hold and then we will resume it once your examinations will get over.

Do let me know if we can get started with the sessions from today onwards.
20/10/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
