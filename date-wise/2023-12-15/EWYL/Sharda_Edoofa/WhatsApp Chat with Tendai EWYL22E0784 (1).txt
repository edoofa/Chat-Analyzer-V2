"Every day, think as you wake up: Today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, and I am not going to waste it." - Dalai Lama
It is time for your session.
21/08/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 101 5949: Good morning
21/08/23, 8:32 am - +91 78273 08969: How was your weekend?
21/08/23, 8:33 am - +263 78 101 5949: It was great thank you.
And yours
21/08/23, 8:36 am - +91 78273 08969: I had a great weekend.
21/08/23, 8:38 am - +91 78273 08969: May I know if you have any queries before we begin?
21/08/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 101 5949: No ma'am I don't have
21/08/23, 8:41 am - +91 78273 08969: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
21/08/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 101 5949: Okay
21/08/23, 8:42 am - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
21/08/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 101 5949: Okay
21/08/23, 8:45 am - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
21/08/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 101 5949: Okay Iam following
21/08/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 101 5949: Maam we agreed that I will do all this things when Iam in India right
21/08/23, 8:48 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, Tendai.
Just Understand it.
21/08/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 101 5949: Okay
21/08/23, 8:53 am - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
21/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 101 5949: Okay maam
21/08/23, 8:57 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 101 5949: So I will have to share the information in the group
21/08/23, 9:01 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, Tendai.
21/08/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 101 5949: Okay
21/08/23, 9:03 am - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
21/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 101 5949: Okay
21/08/23, 9:05 am - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
21/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 101 5949: Okay . Thank you it makes everything easy .

Q3 . Masvingo province
22/08/23, 9:23 am - +91 78273 08969: Tendai, Please answer the question one fully.
22/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 101 5949: Ma'am I think the school is connected with edoofa
22/08/23, 9:25 am - +91 78273 08969: TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.

May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
22/08/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 101 5949: Okay . Maam that's a huge task . I will have to look for the contacts first and get back to you

With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
22/08/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 101 5949: Okay
22/08/23, 10:06 am - +91 78273 08969: We will discuss this further tomorrow.

23/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 101 5949: I wanted inform you that we are currently having our elections in the country so connecting with headmasters right now will be difficult . 
Most of them will be busy and might ignore or delete the messages without reading them thinking they are political .

23/08/23, 9:08 am - +91 78273 08969: That is completely okay, Tendai.

Here is the message -
29/11/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
