15/09/23, 8:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/DKwzcPpQY20JzOmJFGgzZ2
15/09/23, 8:26 am - +91 73031 08177: Thank you so much for the warm welcome and sharing some heartfelt words, it is a pleasure being your mentee.
15/09/23, 8:26 am - +91 73031 08177: Just shared the link with both my parents.
15/09/23, 8:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
15/09/23, 8:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/09/23, 8:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: Your welcome please!
15/09/23, 8:28 am - +91 73031 08177: You could explain the two key objectives for clarity's sake.
15/09/23, 8:30 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding
15/09/23, 8:30 am - Sharda Edoofa: the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/09/23, 8:30 am - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/09/23, 8:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: I hope it is clear now?
15/09/23, 8:33 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
15/09/23, 8:33 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
15/09/23, 8:39 am - +91 73031 08177: Yes it is
15/09/23, 8:40 am - +91 73031 08177: Alright, it's also a pleasure to be working with Ms Sanjana too
15/09/23, 8:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts
15/09/23, 8:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
15/09/23, 8:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
15/09/23, 8:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: How does that sound, Praise?
15/09/23, 8:46 am - +91 73031 08177: That is absolutely great, at the end of the day it is bringing the best out of me to becoming the best version of myself.
15/09/23, 8:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yess.
15/09/23, 8:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
15/09/23, 8:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly skim through the document for five minutes. And let me know when it is done okay?
15/09/23, 8:48 am - +91 73031 08177: Okay sure, I will let you know.
15/09/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: do not spend more than five minutes, okay?
15/09/23, 8:48 am - +91 73031 08177: Okay
15/09/23, 8:53 am - +91 73031 08177: I'm done
15/09/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
15/09/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
15/09/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: You can answer these question later on.
15/09/23, 8:54 am - +91 73031 08177: Alright that's fine with me .
15/09/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: But for now let us begin with our first project
15/09/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Are you ready?
15/09/23, 8:54 am - +91 73031 08177: Yes
15/09/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: *PROJECT 1: CORPORATE ALLIANCE*
15/09/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
15/09/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: so very quickly  summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
15/09/23, 9:13 am - +91 73031 08177: From the audio I have understood that , on the first project I'll have to be exposed to the market i plan to deal on in the future so that I get know and understand about it more right now through technology since most of companies are technologically driven. I will have to start small from the family members, neighbours or family friends- I will have to enlighten them on how  Edoofa is helping me to develop necessary skills for future employability and I will have to share my objectives for the project as well. People that are targetted by this project are managers, human resources managers and  head of organisations and I will have to connect them with Edoofa through a meeting. One of the platforms that can help me get some exposure in regards to the project is LinkedIn.
15/09/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Praise. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
15/09/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 9:23 am - +91 73031 08177: In regards to looking for potential companies that want to be involved  in this project, factors that should be considered are : nature of company, financial stability, scale of company, background founder. All these factors if considered will guide me to get the most suitable and great companies that would play a major role in helping align the partnership(with Edoofa )activities with it's overal strategy.
15/09/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: You know what Praise, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
15/09/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
15/09/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me

This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
15/09/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: *If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.*
15/09/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-*

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

15/09/23, 9:40 am - +91 73031 08177: I understood that, on the 2nd project that is community building, to start off i got to know that it's all about establishing and strengthening connections, relationships and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community. This brings a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals feel safe and are able to communicate towards a common goal. This projects will help me  with the following- networking and persuasion skills. In this project i should be able to identify opportunities and be able to share them. I'll also have to reach out to African students who have finished their high school or about to finish their high school so that I introduce them to the edoofa scholarship program.
15/09/23, 9:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: That’s awesome- Praise, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not

Here is the message -
15/09/23, 9:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
15/09/23, 10:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

15/09/23, 10:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Where did you go in between?
15/09/23, 10:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
15/09/23, 10:10 am - +91 73031 08177: Network tripped, we are using back up now.
I was using WiFi before.
15/09/23, 10:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay okay
15/09/23, 10:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:

Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
15/09/23, 10:16 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:

It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
15/09/23, 10:16 am - +91 73031 08177: 1.Girls' High School Harare

For questions number two, should I write a sample or just a summary of what I'll send to the school heads - introduce myself, how I got my scholarship, future aspirations then later on share the details of my program.

3.students are aware of edoofa but I'm not sure about the administration of the school.
15/09/23, 10:17 am - +91 73031 08177: I do agree
15/09/23, 10:18 am - Sharda Edoofa: I think let us leave question 2 for now and continue.
15/09/23, 10:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
15/09/23, 10:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
15/09/23, 10:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
15/09/23, 10:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group

There has been technical discrepancy in my device due to which I was unable to connect with you yesterday.
As per today, we do not have any call, but I would be more than happy if you can suggest any time tomorrow after 6:30pm.
18/10/23, 8:28 am - +91 73031 08177: Good morning Ms Sharda, we can connect tomorrow at 7pm
18/10/23, 9:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: Sure Praise, let us do that. 
Before that I hope you are aware that we have our session scheduled at 6:00PM.
18/10/23, 9:35 am - +91 73031 08177: Yes I'm aware of it, the link will be shared later on today?
18/10/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is not a call rather the session is scheduled on the EWYL Group. Hence, there is not a need of any link.
18/10/23, 10:35 am - +91 73031 08177: Ohh I understand, that's alright
18/10/23, 3:31 pm - +91 73031 08177: That's alright 😊
18/10/23, 3:36 pm - +91 73031 08177: Cant wait to meet you in person, this is amazing
18/10/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad you liked it praise.
18/10/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let's talk about something important - *the quality of referrals*. 
Now that you have submitted the student application forms/ sooner or later be submitting  them for the Community Building Project  -
18/10/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.
18/10/23, 3:40 pm - +91 73031 08177: Noted
18/10/23, 3:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*. 
*Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*
18/10/23, 3:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Along with that make sure you are giving them an explanation about your journey, about the benefits that you have got and about the skills that you will be acquiring in the process.
18/10/23, 3:45 pm - +91 73031 08177: I will surely do that when I get to chat with the students.
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more

Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? *It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!*
18/10/23, 4:09 pm - +91 73031 08177: I understand, thank you for sharing this with me
I'm more enlightened.
18/10/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
18/10/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that we have discussed the quality of referrals, I also wanted to discuss how your college is going in general?
How's your academics going? Do you have any challenges, ongoing examinations, or projects you'd like to discuss?
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - +91 73031 08177: Sure thing.

Well, college life been has been quite of a rollercoaster. It's the transitioning part is kinda hard but I'm now getting a hang of it. Otherwise the college is nice, the people are nice too, no big problems. Apart from one of my classes the lecturer keeps on teaching in Hindi so most of the things i miss and I'm afraid they could be so important in regards to MTE and ETE.
18/10/23, 4:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Praise that's unfortunate to know that your teachers teach in Hindi too. May I know if you have discussed the concern with them?
18/10/23, 4:25 pm - +91 73031 08177: Yes I have approached her but she keeps turning back to Hindi.
18/10/23, 4:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I understand that, may I know which subject is being taught by her and what is her name?
18/10/23, 4:30 pm - +91 73031 08177: Food Science
Manju ma'am
18/10/23, 4:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Praise I have taken a note of the same.
18/10/23, 4:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, now that we are done for the day, here's a reminder for you about your very own Career Launchpad group, curated by Mr. Anik, which is absolutely on fire right now! 🚀

Joining this group is like securing your golden ticket to a world of opportunities and boundless energy. It's not mandatory, but trust me, you'd be missing out on a treasure trove of greatness if you decide to sit this one out.

I would recommend you to join the group now if you still haven't and be ready to seize every opportunity that comes your way. 🌟💼💪

Your journey towards a brighter future starts here, and we can't wait to see you thrive.

09/12/23, 2:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝
