I'm absolutely filled with emotions today! Our first batch of 2023 students arrived yesterday morning, and it has been an incredibly busy and overwhelming experience. Meeting these new students for the first time was beyond words, I cannot describe the feeling adequately. I'm now even more thrilled to meet you too! Don't forget to watch the video I'm sharing below; it captures the excitement and enthusiasm we're all experiencing!🌻

03/08/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are doing well. You know, many of my students' winter break will be commencing from Friday, which is tomorrow, and they are all set to resume their EWYL journey and take a step towards their future education without wasting a single day of their holidays!

So, I wanted to ask if your winter break has started or not? When would you be able to resume your EWYL journey?
03/08/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 756 9307: Break will be in 2 weeks time
04/08/23, 8:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Malvern!

29/08/23, 6:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Malvern!

How are you doing?
18/09/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 8:31 am - +263 77 756 9307: Good morning. Please note that Malvern is a boarder and is at school. He also does not have a phone at school. So he shall only be available after 23 November, which is the last day for his A level exams.
18/09/23, 8:32 am - +263 77 756 9307: As the father, i have been doing most of the communication on his behalf, but i think its better he does it himself. So i advice you put everything on hold until after 23 November.
19/09/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, How are you today?
19/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 756 9307: Fine
19/09/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if we can connect tomorrow for an hour?
19/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 756 9307: May i know whats there tomorrow
19/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 756 9307: Its ok
20/09/23, 7:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: To complete the initial sessions, @263777569307
21/09/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨
21/09/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 756 9307: Carry on
21/09/23, 10:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: - I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates NAME to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
21/09/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 756 9307: Ok noted
21/09/23, 12:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

How are you? Are you ready to move forward with our discussion?
25/09/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 756 9307: Yes
25/09/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects Malver can and will be a part of.
25/09/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 756 9307: Doesnt this need Malvern himself please. You may wait until he comes back on 23 or 24 November after exams completion
25/09/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Sure! In order to do that you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
25/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 756 9307: You are aware that Malvern is at school and is busy with his exams; he does not have a phone either at the school. I told you all this. So why then should i draft an email again to that effect
25/09/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, however in order to track our students it is important for us to keep a record. Therefore you just have to draft an email so that we can connect Malvern at the given time.
17/11/23, 4:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Malvern!
Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
