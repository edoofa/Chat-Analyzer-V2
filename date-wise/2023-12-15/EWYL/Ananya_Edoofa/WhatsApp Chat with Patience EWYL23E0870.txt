06/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Okay thank you
08/12/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Patience!

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. Let us connect on Monday now, as we do not have our sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
11/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Patience!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Afternoon to you too ,how are you ,I dont have internet access at the moment I'll make sure to take my time and watch it later
11/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 820 3042: I think it is to give us (students) an opportunity to learn about the bussiness world and to earn credits that will be used to sponsor our education
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Thank you, well understood
11/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Its nice to meet you Miss Davi and Ms Sanjana i look forward to learn from you
11/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
11/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes ,very.
11/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
11/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so let us conclude today's session here, I am really happy with your performance so far! Keep up the good work, and I promise no one can stop you from reaching heights! 

Now let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Good day!☀️
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Patience!

Did you know octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two pumps to the gills, and one to the body. They're basically the rockstars of the ocean with a unique sense of style! Now, let's dive into our session with that octopus energy!🐙
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 820 3042: 🤯Hmm thats new

13/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Patience!

13/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to read the newsletter?
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes i read it
13/12/23, 1:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Exactly but i really like the story of one of the students an the quotes
13/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great!At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
13/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Amazing  😄 ,i cant wait
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes let me read it

13/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 820 3042: I understood the concept of awareness that is being well informed about the surrounding and the things or events happening around us

14/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Patience!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 339 1635: Fiction is not in our vocabulary...

14/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
14/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes ma'am 😁
