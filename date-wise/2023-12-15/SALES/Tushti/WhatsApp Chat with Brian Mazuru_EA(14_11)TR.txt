14/11/23, 1:24 pm - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
14/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 231 6606: Yeah yeah sure
14/11/23, 1:32 pm - Tushti: Alright so Brian, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background.

14/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 231 6606: .I am currently in the L6  and my subjects are Geography,  Statistics and economics .l am astrong student and enjoy learning new things.  My weaknesses are comminication skills and perfectionism, but I'm working on overcoming those. I would like to study civil engineering because I am fascinated by . My mother  works in South  Africa  as a maid and my Daddy is a piece worker    there as well  . Both of the     end at O'level  . In our family  we are three children  a got a big  sister she is already  married and a little  brother  he is in grade six . My mother  was the one paying for my Education  so far .   At Mufakose 1 high we pay  $80  per term    . Mufakose 1  high  school   it is located in Harare  province

14/11/23, 2:18 pm - Tushti: I am also pleased to hear that you are from  Mufakose 1 high, as we have recently welcomed many students from your school!
14/11/23, 2:19 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a  younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your parents to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are your parents facing such a situation?
14/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 231 6606: Here in Zimbabwe  I stay with my Aunty    all my parents  went to South  Africa  looking  for greener pastures   and my brother  live with   my  mother's  sister   that's  how we live  . We never lived as a Family  👪  since

14/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 231 6606: I expect that this scholarship program will provide me with the financial support I need to pursue my studies and achieve my goals.  I also expect that the program, will provide me with access to resources and opportunities that will help me grow and develop my skills and knowledge.  Finally, I expect that the program will connect me with a supportive community of like-minded individuals who can help me on my journey."
14/11/23, 3:03 pm - Tushti: Brian, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
14/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 231 6606: However I got this  other  relative of mine in Uk he once promised  to  help me ,
14/11/23, 3:04 pm - Tushti: Well, in that case, lets add your relative tho this group
14/11/23, 3:04 pm - Tushti: Kindly share their number
14/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 231 6606: Okay let me do that

15/11/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 231 6606: Good morning  Ms Tushti
15/11/23, 10:29 am - Tushti: I am waiting for you to share your relative's number, dear
15/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 231 6606: Well I wanted  to ask how affordable  is it going  to be like as I have said   before   , my family    suffers social  economic  stress
15/11/23, 10:32 am - Tushti: The cost of education abroad can be around $7000 per year, with the help of Edoofa it can be brought down to around $2000 per year, and further reduced by our EWYl Program
15/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 231 6606: Okay   I need to talk to  him  first
15/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 231 6606: Of which  he hasn't  been   online
15/11/23, 10:42 am - Tushti: I see
15/11/23, 10:42 am - Tushti: Do you feel this would be affordable for the family
15/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 231 6606: Oh! Okay  that's pretty  cool
15/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 231 6606: Umm   it is paid up once  !?
15/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 231 6606: What about  the preparation  for the journey   as in  the visa  process  , flight tickets 🎟   and also  accommodation  , food and stuff like that
15/11/23, 10:47 am - Tushti: No dear, the fee is paid in two installments, one half at the beginning of each term
15/11/23, 10:48 am - Tushti: Personal expenses are not covered by the scholarship, though our Visa officer would be guiding you through the process
15/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 231 6606: Ummm if it's  like that , I don't  think  we will manage as I had  said  before  my family  is not financially  stable
15/11/23, 10:53 am - Tushti: Noted
15/11/23, 10:53 am - Tushti: In that case, would you like to withdraw your application?
15/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 231 6606: I wish l could  proceed   but   yhoo!  I can't  meet  the requirements   financially <This message was edited>
