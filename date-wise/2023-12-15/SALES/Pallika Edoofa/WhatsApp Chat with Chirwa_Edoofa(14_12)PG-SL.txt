14/12/23, 1:45 pm - +265 999 12 49 91: It is the scholarship opportunity thatotivated me the most and to study abroad, which I understand to be the best option to grab compared to our local colleges universities which are very expensive and of unreliable resources. Yes, this is what motivated me
14/12/23, 1:46 pm - +265 999 12 49 91: I don't really understand the Edoofa program well, please if you may clarify to me about everything how it runs and how as a future student is required of me as well as my guardian. I will appreciate
14/12/23, 1:48 pm - +265 999 12 49 91: Iam currently not aware of what requirements are needed for me to get consideration. I thought this is the time to get that clarification
14/12/23, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Chirwa
14/12/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me share some information.
14/12/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14/12/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, several schools, educators, and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.


*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*
14/12/23, 1:53 pm - +265 999 12 49 91: Yes for sure Iam looking forward to this an opportunity.
14/12/23, 1:54 pm - +265 999 12 49 91: By deserving students, what are the requirements for one to get the chance?
As for Malawians, what's the minimum grades/ MSCE points required?
14/12/23, 1:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Chirwa, Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now, we accept up to 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35, this would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program



The minimum requirement was higher pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and performing well in MSCE!
14/12/23, 1:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
