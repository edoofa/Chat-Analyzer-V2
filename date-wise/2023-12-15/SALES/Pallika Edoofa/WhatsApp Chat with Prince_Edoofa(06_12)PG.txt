07/12/23, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: 1. Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 4000 Edoofians with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are expose African Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a Higher Education Concierge!

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in your home country itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
07/12/23, 1:11 pm - +27 68 545 4346: Very I go through this I understand so it’s how much the remaining expenses cost

07/12/23, 1:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Before continuing Ms. Joyce, Have you gone through this document once?
07/12/23, 1:29 pm - +27 68 545 4346: I do but it’s bit difficult because the words are very small to see ,, so what I need from you to help me and make me understand tell me here the very important things to follow and to do
07/12/23, 1:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Joyce, you can have Prince to go through this document once, also, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - +27 68 545 4346: Yes am putting my extra effort to explore the opportunity,, and  is it possible to go to Malawi embassy to find out there?
07/12/23, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms Joyce, the Embassy works with the international affairs between India and Malawi. Our students visit the *embassy for visa procedures as guided by our Admissions Team*. The functioning of organizations is monitored by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) in India.
07/12/23, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: We are Registered under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs Under the Government of India. Let me share with you the incorporation certificate of our parent organization-Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt Limited

By reducing the cost of fees from $8000 to $2000-3000 


Edoofa scholarship works with many universities in india for couple of years a

When one get a chance of being taken for a scholarship the can do some protect while are learning ( earn while learning programs)
Where the get some credits which helps the in paying fees as well as to get job skills and knowledge before finishing there school


Another this is India don't allow students to work while learning because they go there with student VISA not job VISA so students the must concentrate on there school unless when they are doing the earn while learning programs 

Edoofa scholarship had counselors which help and advice students when there going with there learning in India 

Edoofa will help student in the process of VISA by guarding them

May I know if you are available for the session now?

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - +265 883 62 68 47: No
12/12/23, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
12/12/23, 2:25 pm - +265 883 62 68 47: No
12/12/23, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand Prince!!

 let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
12/12/23, 2:39 pm - +265 883 62 68 47: I know I read it from the document you  sent (earn while learning programs)
12/12/23, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
12/12/23, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
