14/12/23, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Vanessa,
How are you doing today?
14/12/23, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Before commencing the discussion, Please note that as per the protocols of the program, the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary for the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*
In case they are not available right now, they can still be part of a group and catch up with the conversations later.
