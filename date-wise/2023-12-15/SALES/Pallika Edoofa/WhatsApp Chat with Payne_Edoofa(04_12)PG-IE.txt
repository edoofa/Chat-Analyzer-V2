04/12/23, 5:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please share the term results too
04/12/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 709 6076: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Please share the A level's term results.
04/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Currently the term results are not where l am so l dont know if you can hold on so that l can ask someone to send them to me and l can give them to you.
04/12/23, 5:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Payne, Please let me know the subject combination in your A level.
04/12/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 709 6076: A level combination : Pure Mathematics ,Biology and Chemistry
04/12/23, 5:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Payne, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
04/12/23, 5:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
04/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Yes l am very confident for sure.
04/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Of course yes ,l did some research concerning foreign education with the aim of achieving a better insight about it.
04/12/23, 5:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Ok , thank you very much.
04/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Let me go through it.
04/12/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Ok , well understood .
04/12/23, 7:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Payne
04/12/23, 7:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 7:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Payne, I would like to know if you were interested in Medical Field why have not you opted Physics in your A level?
04/12/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 710 4113: Mr Njini P, was my Vice Principal at Mkoba Teachers College. I am happy to hear this.
04/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Well, actually biology was my favourite subject since O level therefore l opted Biology since it was also part of my dream carrier. The other issue also was that l seem to understand biology better than physics, so l think those are the reasons.
04/12/23, 7:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Payne, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Physiotherapy*

*Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

*Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*, etc

Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you?
04/12/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Well l understand. But here in Zimbabwe we usually do a combination of three subjects in science department. We are asked to choose between maths , chemistry (which are compulsory), then we choose between physics and chemistry. Except those few who does an additional fourth subject will then opt all the four subjects. Besides that it's impossible to take biology physics and chemistry in schools as they are not part of school offered combination without Mathematics.
04/12/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 709 6076: So l kindly want to ask if Mathematics is also considered as well.
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Payne
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this once
04/12/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Well, you can expand on Bachelor of Science in microbiology.
04/12/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 709 6076: I mean physics and biology are not compulsory .
04/12/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Yes l did.
04/12/23, 9:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 9:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa changed the group name from "Payne_Edoofa(02/12)PG-IE" to "Payne_Edoofa(0/12)PG-IE"
04/12/23, 9:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa changed the group name from "Payne_Edoofa(0/12)PG-IE" to "Payne_Edoofa(04/12)PG-IE"
05/12/23, 8:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
05/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 710 4113: Yes you can proceed. Only that we have some challenges on network and power here and there.
05/12/23, 9:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Forward
05/12/23, 9:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me explain the course to you
05/12/23, 9:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.
