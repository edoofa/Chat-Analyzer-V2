Its qualities include a vibrant history, a strong emphasis on family values, and a deep respect for knowledge.

23/10/23, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Let me share with you few advantages to study in India

*1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System-* The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 800 universities, 39,000 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses. <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *2. It’ Affordable-*  Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.

01/11/23, 9:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor in Psychology* is a 3-year undergraduate course.

*What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*

In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.

 *What is it about?*

Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.

BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.

*Career Prospects*

What can you do with a BA degree in Psychology?

The graduates of BA Psychology have a lot of opportunities ahead, both in academics and in the job sector.

*Jobs*

The graduates of this course get various opportunities to work in many different fields in both the private sector and the government sector. They get work in departments like hospitals, educational institutes, corporate organizations, etc. Some of the profiles which are open for them are Social Worker, Sales Representative, Recruiters, Teachers, etc.
