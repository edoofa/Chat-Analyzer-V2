Now being your counsellor I  would like to give you the opportunity to express more about yourself. Please include your educational qualifications, career aspirations, the province that you live in, hobbies & interests, about your family and siblings, which professions your parents are into, and more in detail.
You can also add anything more that you would like to share.

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your daughter ahead for education.
19/09/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 816 2873: I am a young lady aged 28. I was born and bred in Gokwe which is in the Midlands province. I am the first born and the only girl in a family of four. I did my Primary and Secondary Education (ordinary level) in Gokwe. I finished in 2011 and then moved to Harare (Mashonaland Province) where I did a few courses in International Computer Driving License, Introductory and Advanced Course on Foot Reflexology, a Grooming Course as well as Communication: The Art of Visula Story Telling. In 2018, I moved to Bulawayo, Matebeleland province where I did Cambridge Ordinary Level for one year and then Advanced level in 2019 and 2020 at Dominican Convent, Bulawayo. I majored in Arts since I had realized my passion to stand up for the truth and justice. I worked very hard and was able to attain 12points. I think I will better work for truth, justice and peace as a lawyer. 
My greatest strength has been working under challenging environments and conditions; and in diversified disciplines so as to improve my experiences and competence in multiple task. I am keen to be an integral part of a team that adds value to an organization and business community at large.
I am someone who is keen to learn, hardworking, self motivated, flexible, a team player and a leader.  I have the ability to communicate and relate well at all levels in multicultural teams. I also swiftly adapt and adjust to all situations and environments.
My hobbies include reading thriller novels, taking walks in the forest, cycling, listening to reflective music and spending time with friends to understand myself and them better.
As I earlier mentioned, I am the first and only girl child in a family of four. My siblings are still in school, two are in High School and the last born is still in Primary school. My father is a small scale farmer. This is what he has been doing and has managed to send us to school through selling his produce at the market. My mother is a housewife who also does sewing of clothes at home. She owns a sewing machine and therefore she is able to make money through sewing. She also knows knitting and crotcheting  and she has been doing this for a living. We were all raised up in a Christian way and we are Catholics.
19/09/23, 9:56 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing about yourself and your family honestly, Caroline

19/09/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 336 6026: I am Mrs Rosaria aged 49. I am a housewife who is self employed. I am a sewing mistress which I learnt from the missionary sisters who taught us. This has been my way of making money as people bring their material and I make dresses, skirts, trousers and blouses for them. I also know knitting and this gives me money especially in winter where I knit jerseys, wool hats and gloves for  school children. This has helped me in supporting my family together with my husband. I am also good at crotcheting and I used to crotchet and going to sell the items in South Africa. I basically can confidently say that I am a business lady. I went to school up to Ordinary Level. 
All this hard work has been to ensure that my children pursue education and achieve their dreams.
19/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 608 1161: I’m Mr Coleen Mafika the father of Caroline. I’m aged 51.l live in Gokwe centre.

I have managed to support my family through this with the help of my wife who sews clothes for people, especially african attires.I hold Ordinary Level certificate and I learnt farming from my father who was a well known and productive farmer. I have taken this path and it has been a successful way of supporting my family.

19/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 816 2873: Thank you. I have been helping my family at home. My father gave me a portion where I could also plant my crops for selling to earn some money. I also have been helping my mother with the cutting of materials for sewing. Apart from that I have been working as a volunteer at church, helping the youths with Education for life especially this time when the drug abuse cases have skyrocketed. I have been more interested in the girl child with the motive of helping them to be confident, self motivated and to know that they can achieve what they want in life, even the sky is not the limit
19/09/23, 10:12 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear and learn more about you. I am really happy that you expressed yourself genuinely.

19/09/23, 10:13 am - Kunal: May I know, how much was your per term fee in A level and who has been supporting you so far for education?

19/09/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 816 2873: Yes, I am aware. I trust that my parents will continue being supportive as they have been
19/09/23, 10:24 am - Kunal: As you know,Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
19/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 336 6026: Thank you

So, do you have any past experiences or learnings in this field specifically?
19/09/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 816 2873: Yes I am. I do not have personal or first hand experiences as such but my major concern from what I have read that it is happening in the society is the issue of minors being given into marriage to old men just because parents want wealthy from the man or because the religion allows it. There have been cases where young girls of 14years or below have died giving birth but they have no one to speak up for them. Even if they go to the courts, some lawyers prioritize money and not human dignity and life
19/09/23, 11:00 am - Kunal: That is fine
So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e A level and O level results, please?

Its  diversity will also help me to be comfortable and adapt in any country that I will work from.

19/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
19/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
19/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 816 2873: No, I am not familiar. Please alert me
19/09/23, 12:45 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/09/23, 12:46 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 1:06 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
19/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Oh alright, I see. I think they would work harder to ensure that they meet the due date. The good part is also that it is paid in installments which gives them more time to look for money
19/09/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Yes we are, the network is becoming slow
19/09/23, 1:09 pm - Kunal: That is alright
19/09/23, 1:09 pm - Kunal: I understand
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
19/09/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 816 2873: That’s good news. I would opt for that. I don’t know how it is done, please enlighten me
19/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
19/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
19/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
19/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
19/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: *Webinars: -*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
19/09/23, 1:11 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
19/09/23, 1:11 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Very interesting l…this will be very beneficial. This is a very helpful program I can say
19/09/23, 1:21 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
19/09/23, 1:40 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
19/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 816 2873: I’m liking this. Yes please let us proceed
19/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 816 2873: It means in the end if one works extra hard, I can end up funding myself without troubling the family, right?
19/09/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that even after earning from the Earn While You Learn program, there will be still some finances left to be paid by the family
19/09/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
19/09/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
19/09/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
19/09/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
19/09/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
19/09/23, 2:17 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
19/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Yes we are
19/09/23, 2:24 pm - Kunal: Please address this
19/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 816 2873: I like all of them but especially the third one
19/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Sorry my network is sometimes poor
19/09/23, 2:32 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

19/09/23, 2:32 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
19/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Okay thank you. My parents would help paying the remaining fee
19/09/23, 2:37 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
19/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Thank you very much. Yes we will discuss.
19/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kunal: That is alright
So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
19/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 816 2873: They are happy for me and are also looking forward for me to have such an experience.
19/09/23, 2:47 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
19/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Oh alright thank you. Who would be considered as the senior authority?
19/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Very true
19/09/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: It can be your school authorities
19/09/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
19/09/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
19/09/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Oh alright thank you for the information
19/09/23, 3:01 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
19/09/23, 3:01 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
19/09/23, 3:01 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Oh alright thank you
19/09/23, 3:19 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 3:25 pm - Kunal: I am expecting your response, Caroline
19/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Alright, let me look at it
19/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 816 2873: It’s still downloading
19/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 816 2873: I think we have gone through stages 1 to 3
19/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 816 2873: You also shared information on how stage 4-6 goes
19/09/23, 3:35 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
19/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 816 2873: I would like to hear more but I need to charge the phone, the battery is now low
19/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kunal: I understand
Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
19/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
19/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
19/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Yes, I am clear. Thank you
19/09/23, 3:39 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
19/09/23, 3:39 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

Are you ready for the same?
20/09/23, 10:55 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 9:36 am - +263 71 336 6026: Good morning
21/09/23, 10:10 am - Austin: Good Morning to you all!
How are you doing?
21/09/23, 10:18 am - +263 71 336 6026: We are doing well thank you
21/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 816 2873: Good morning
21/09/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 608 1161: Good morning
21/09/23, 11:19 am - Austin: Good to hear from you all!
I hope you are doing well
21/09/23, 11:19 am - Austin: May I know your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me please?
21/09/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 336 6026: I find thw Edoofa Scholarship Program very helpful financially as well as in the pursuit of my child's education and career. 
As we were discussing as a family we cane up with two questions:
1. What happens in the case that us as parents fail to assist financially before she goes or when she is already there? Will she lose the scholarship or will she be sent back from India?
2. We know that our daughter is capable and works very hard but in the case that she does not do well in the program is there an opportunity that she would be given a different course to do?
21/09/23, 11:58 am - Austin: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
21/09/23, 11:59 am - Austin: 1) In that case, you request for a grace period which would be an extended timeframe to prepare the costs and if the challenges continue, student can take a term off but can continue with the EWYL program to reduce the costs
21/09/23, 12:01 pm - Austin: 2) Please note that you have the opportunity to change the program before departing to India, but not after, therefore, if you wish to change the program you can inform me or our Admissions team during these sessions

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Section 5

Many people have different views about Africa and its economic situation. This has been due to the way that it is portrayed globally especially on the social media. Africa is a continent yet it is usually presented as a small village whereby one is able to tell what is happening continentally. In this essay I will argue to a greater extent that the poor diets faced by many African countries are not due to the fact that their farms are stagnant and inefficient. There are issues like its poor economy that are the reasons for many Africans’ poor diets. 
Africans are blessed with rich soils that could ensure rich diets, the major challenge is the resources to help prevent the stagnancy and inefficiency of the farms. With the poor economic situation in most of the African countries it is hard for the farmers to buy input like tractors, fertilizers and irrigation facilities. It is pathetic that sometimes even the seeds cannot be sourced. In farming there is need of labour and these people need wages which becomes impossible for a farmer living in a country whose economy has shutdown. This leads to poor diets and not sorely stagnant and inefficient farms.
However, on the other hand, it is true to say that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. Counties like Somalia are desert countries and therefore in these hot weather conditions in which it is bound to happen that they have poor diets.

My inspirational Story

Growing up in a society as well as a family that upholds ethical values, human dignity, unity, team work, empathy, compassion, forgiveness, justice and hard work; the society and my family have always been my inspiration. These values were cultivated in me at a younger age and have kept me going. In fact, they have shaped me into deciding who I want to be in future and the career path that I want to choose. Humanity comes first for me before anything else. I have grown to realize that we all need each other and together everyone attains more. I am most happy when others are happy and therefore tries my best to be there for others. The short courses I have pursued apart from Ordinary and Advanced levels have also been a way of equipping myself so as to be able to help others. These include courses in International Computer Driving License, Introductory and Advanced Course on Foot Reflexology, a Grooming Course as well as Communication: The Art of Visula Story Telling. In 2018, I majored in Arts since I had realized my passion to stand up for the truth and justice. I think I will better work for truth, justice and peace as a lawyer. 
My greatest strength has been working under challenging environments and conditions; and in diversified disciplines so as to improve my experiences and competence in multiple task. I am keen to be an integral part of a team that adds value to an organization and business community at large.
I am someone who is keen to learn, hardworking, self motivated, flexible, a team player and a leader.  I have the ability to communicate and relate well at all levels in multicultural teams. I also swiftly adapt and adjust to all situations and environments.
My hobbies include reading thriller novels, taking walks in the forest, cycling, listening to reflective music and spending time with friends to understand myself and them better.

24/09/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 816 2873: Yes
24/09/23, 7:04 pm - +263 71 608 1161: Good evening
24/09/23, 7:05 pm - +263 71 608 1161: When we discussed as a family we came up with these questions or rather where we need more clarification.
1.In the letter you talked about the uncertainty at the moment whether the scholarship will be 100% or not, when we get to know only after we get the offer letter will it not affect perhaps the funds where we would need more money? Please shed more light on this.
2. Are there other Arts programs with the duration of less than 5years that could also be less expensive or is it that all courses offered range between $2000-$3000.
3. Where it says that Course offered is subject to change, could you please give us a list of some courses to expect.
4.If a student misses the deadline of payment you said that this will be revoked but eligibility remains, what does it mean?
5.If due to deficiency of original and valid documents, $350 is non refundable...what if the issue is that the parents have failed to raise the 500-750 or the plane ticket will the $350 be refunded?
24/09/23, 7:15 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Mr Coleen!
I hope you had a great day, let me please address the questions
24/09/23, 7:17 pm - Austin: 1) Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees, The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship <This message was edited>
24/09/23, 7:19 pm - Austin: At the same time based on the performance and academics of Caroline, I have recommended her application for a higher quantum of scholarship while will be discussed during a call with our Program Director m
24/09/23, 7:22 pm - Austin: 2) Yes, there are programs in Psychology, Sociology, Political Science, Journalism, Economics etc with a duration of 3 years. The cost of education would range within the same range but can be below $2000 for certain courses(Law, Political Science) with a higher quantum of scholarship
24/09/23, 7:24 pm - Austin: 3) The course may change only if the scholarship seat is fully occupied or the course is discontinued. For Caroline's program you won't have to worry about this claus as it is a demanding program and seat are available as of now.
24/09/23, 7:27 pm - Austin: 4) If a student misses the deadline, the application will be revoked but if later wishes to re apply, the eligibility will be valid and can continue from the enrollment stage but the re application cost is higher and can re apply only if seats are available. As of now, 650+ scholarship seats for the intake have been occupied by Zimbabweans and seats are filling fast
24/09/23, 7:28 pm - Austin: 5) No please, in that case you still have the option where you can request for a payment plan for the registration fees or an extension to arrive in India. Our Admissions team will be guiding  through the same
24/09/23, 7:28 pm - Austin: The registration fee($500-$750) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2000 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2000-600= $1400
24/09/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 608 1161: Thank you very much for the clarity, all is clear and we are relieved
24/09/23, 7:36 pm - Austin: You are most welcome, are you having other questions for me?
24/09/23, 7:40 pm - +263 71 608 1161: No questions, this is what we had
24/09/23, 7:43 pm - Austin: This is well noted!
As you know higher education is a big decision that has to be taken through discussions with both students and families. 

So shall I schedule a video call for you with the Program Director at Edoofa to discuss Caroline's application, performance, and further procedures?
24/09/23, 7:59 pm - +263 71 608 1161: We are getting tense and worried and we have a lot of what ifs especially when it comes to finances. The economy in Zimbabwe is getting worse by each day, no one knows tomorrow, will we make it with our small business. These are some of our worries
24/09/23, 8:02 pm - +263 71 608 1161: A video call will be ideal but at the moment we do not have data bundle, we have been using WhatsApp bundle which does not support calls.
24/09/23, 8:03 pm - Austin: I am well aware of the Scenario Mr Coleen, Our Senior Academician was there in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year. During this call, our Program Director will also be discussing about the higher quantum of scholarship(90-100% on tuition and Accommodation) and more about the opportunity
24/09/23, 8:04 pm - Austin: The call will be for tomorrow and shall I schedule it at 8:30 am CAT tomorrow?
24/09/23, 8:56 pm - Austin: Looking forward to hearing from you, Mr Coleen!
25/09/23, 7:34 am - +263 71 608 1161: Good morning, may you kindly cancel the process for my daughter we don’t have money to pay before 30 September
25/09/23, 9:50 am - Austin: Good Morning Mr Coleen!
How are you today?
25/09/23, 9:51 am - Austin: As you have seen, we have followed a fair and transparent process where we discuss all aspects of the Edoofa program and began the eligibility check process only after your acknowledgement. Considering your challenges, we have even forwarded Caroline's application for a 90-100% scholarship. What happened now?
26/09/23, 2:20 pm - Austin: Good Afternoon @263716081161
26/09/23, 2:20 pm - Austin: I hope you are doing well please, I was expecting to hear from you may I know what happened?
29/09/23, 6:47 pm - +263 71 608 1161: My apologies, at the moment things are tough for me. We are not able to continue with this
