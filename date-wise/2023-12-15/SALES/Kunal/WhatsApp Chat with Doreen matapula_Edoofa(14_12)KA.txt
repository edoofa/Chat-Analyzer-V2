14/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, a number of schools, educators and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.
