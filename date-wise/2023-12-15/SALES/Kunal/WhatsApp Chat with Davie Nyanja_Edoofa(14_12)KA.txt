14/12/23, 3:05 pm - Kunal: Well noted
Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now,we accept upto 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregrate of 35,this would be the maxumum limit for eligibility.All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program
14/12/23, 3:05 pm - Kunal: The minimum requirement was higher pre pandemic but during the pandemic a lot of students failed to recieve enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements has been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about Davie meeting the requirements and perform well in MSCE!
14/12/23, 3:10 pm - +27 78 760 0842: I am confident for Davie. He has a certificate obtained at phwezi private secondary last year of  21 points.  Eng 5,geography 5,mathematics 2,additional maths 4 chemistry, 4 biology 3,and physics 3 .
14/12/23, 3:11 pm - +27 78 760 0842: But we made go back to school due to luck off opportunities like this ones.
14/12/23, 3:24 pm - Kunal: I can understand
As you know,Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
14/12/23, 3:26 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Yes, I am.
14/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
14/12/23, 3:48 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Being a farmer as such I am just hopeful that some  crops grow well so as I could save much for him.
14/12/23, 3:49 pm - +27 78 760 0842: Our living conditions are very low in Malawi  and we are so poor but I will try my all for him to sustain his wish.
