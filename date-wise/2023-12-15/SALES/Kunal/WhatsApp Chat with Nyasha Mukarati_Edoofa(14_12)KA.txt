What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

From my interactions with students in the edoofa program, I've learned that they're grateful for the support they've received. The program has helped them gain access to educational resources they wouldn't have had otherwise. In addition, the program has given them a sense of community and belonging. They feel like they're part of a group of people who are all working towards the same goal of improving their education. I've also learned that the program has helped them become more confident in their academic abilities. They've gained new skills and knowledge, and they feel more prepared for the future.


Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
Because I have great potential and will work hard to exceed my potential and bring positive changes to my people.

14/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 692 1784: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
14/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 692 1784: l am really confident
14/12/23, 2:51 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion for Accounting, you are eligible to pursue 
 
*Bachelor of Commerce*

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
