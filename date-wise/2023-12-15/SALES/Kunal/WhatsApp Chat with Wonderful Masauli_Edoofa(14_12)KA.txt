Let me help you understand more about the program, Mrs Catherine
14/12/23, 12:56 pm - Kunal: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14/12/23, 12:56 pm - Kunal: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, a number of schools, educators and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.
14/12/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 1:01 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: With great hope and expectation, we are looking forward to have him enrolled successfully in this prestigious program. We believe he is capable as your assessment shall attest to the same.
14/12/23, 1:03 pm - +265 999 87 18 02: Yes very much so and we looking forward to a successful assessment that will see our child enrolled in the prestigious program
14/12/23, 1:14 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
*Mr Owen and Mrs Catherine* ,I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
14/12/23, 1:32 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: My name is already known. I am a 49 year old mother of 3 boys and Wonderful is the second born. I have a Bachelor's and Master's degree both in Business Administration from the University of Malawi. Besides our three boys we also have 4 dependents who are in lower classes of secondary school.

Currently I am working as a Civil Servant under Local Government as an Administrator. I am based in Zomba where our family has settled since 2003.

As a family, we have always admired those who have been able to send their children abroad for education that meets international standards in every sense. But, it remained an admiration as such opportunities seems expensive considering our income and responsibilities. Hence it remained a desire which we could not even imagine how to achieve it. 

When the Edoofa program presented this opportunity before us, and especially knowing its in India, we felt its a way destiny finds its way when you so much desire. Besides that, our son is a hard worker and a performer with big creams. And we felt this is an opportunity not to be missed for anything. We followed every detail with keen interest.

Why so much interest? I and my husband Owen have at one point been considered on short courses in India under the ITEC program and the experience we gained is so enriching in our respective careers and have always wanted our children to have such an opportunity to study in India. Mine was a two weeks course and my husband had 6 weeks course which gives us a foretaste of the multicultural education blended with Indian outreach to global students.
14/12/23, 1:35 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: He is interested in the Agricultural studies as he aspire to be a commercial farmer. And in today's world, agriculture needs to advance in pace with technological advancements which we believe India shall give our son a chance to realise his dream.
14/12/23, 1:45 pm - +265 999 87 18 02: So much about our family has been said by my wife Eluby. However, I am Owen Masauli a father to Wonderful Masauli, I hold Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and also a Master's in Business Administration. In addition to that I also hold numerous certificates in Adult learning in different disciplines. 
Am working for the Malawi Government under the Local Council as Principal Trade Officer.
Otherwise the rest is all about what Eluby has already said
14/12/23, 2:05 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing your background and perspective. It's clear that education, particularly international education, holds great significance for your family. The admiration for those who have sent their children abroad and the desire to provide such an opportunity for your son, Wonderful, reflect a commitment to academic excellence and global exposure.

Your educational background with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Malawi, coupled with your role as a Civil Servant in Local Government, showcases a strong foundation and dedication to your career.
14/12/23, 2:05 pm - Kunal: Thank you, Mr Owen, for providing additional insights into your background. It's clear that education and professional development are valued in your family, with both you and your wife holding advanced degrees. Your work as a Principal Trade Officer for the Malawi Government under the Local Council reflects a commitment to public service and community development.
14/12/23, 2:06 pm - Kunal: Could you shed some light on what kind of student you feel your child is, what are your child's strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe *Wonderful* as a person, please?

Please include these aspects so that we can guide you with the best way
1. Educational qualifications and current Education Level.
2. Career aspirations
3. Hobbies and interests
4. Family members, siblings
5. Name of O-level and A-level school
6. Term fee at school and who has been supporting the child's education so far.

You can also add anything more that you would like to share.
14/12/23, 2:33 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Wonderful turned 18. He is a very hard working boy as far as his studies are concerned. He is in form 4 at St Louis High School in Dedza and is always in top 3. He will be sitting for Malawi School Certificate of Education this coming June 2024 and we have high expectation that he shall qualify for University selection.

His aspiration is to study any field in agriculture leaning much to Agribusiness (Either in Animal Production or Crop Production or even both). He desires to have his career in establishing agricultural oriented businesses.

His hobbies are mainly playing soccer and plays in school team when in school and local community team when on holidays. He also like exercises and goes to gymnasium. He likes playing draft with friends and family when home and likes watching wrestling matches on TV. He is a fun of circular music.

He has two brothers, and 4 cousins in the house as siblings. Among them, he is a quiet boy and very observant before he can express anything on his mind.

He is sitting for Malawi School Certificate of Education administered by Malawi National Examination Board. He is at St. Louis High School as said already and this is in Dedza. Its a boarding school. We have always received good reports of him from school management which shows he is cooperative and well behaved in following instructions and set school regulations. His outstanding performance shows how dedicated he is to his studies. Even when on holiday, he is always paying attention to his books.

We, as parents have been supporting his studies all along without any external financial support.
14/12/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: It's truly inspiring to hear about Wonderful's dedication to his studies and his clear aspirations for the future. His commitment to excellence, both in academics and his hobbies, reflects a well-rounded and focused individual.
It's evident that Wonderful's hard work, discipline, and focus on his studies are commendable. His interest in agriculture and agribusiness aligns with the growing importance of sustainable and impactful careers in these fields.

14/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: Well noted
Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now,we accept upto 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregrate of 35,this would be the maxumum limit for eligibility.All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program
14/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: The minimum requirement was higher pre pandemic but during the pandemic a lot of students failed to recieve enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements has been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about him meeting the requirements and perform well in MSCE!
14/12/23, 3:18 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Extremely confident. We foresee a lot of credits for him. Hopefully we see him below  20 points.
14/12/23, 3:30 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Based on my evaluation, considering his subjects, interests, and passion towards agriculture, he is eligible to pursue

14/12/23, 3:46 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Wow. This is very comprehensive and incorporates almost everything desirable. One can foretell a final product which is a well equipped graduated ready to add value to economic growth and development through improved and sustainable environmental friendly methods of agriculture. I believe he will also appreciate going through this insight of B. Sc. Agriculture next week when he comes. But it reflects well with what he desires.
14/12/23, 3:48 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: As for us, we recommend this to be a good one.
14/12/23, 3:51 pm - +265 999 87 18 02: Yes, this is befitting his career path
14/12/23, 3:54 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
As we've thoroughly covered your course details, and since you are aware Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
14/12/23, 4:00 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: The costs are often very high starting from application fees, registration, tuition, accommodation, pocket allowance for sustainability, stationary, air tickets etc . We don't know the amounts to date as we haven't even tried searching, knowing already that we can't afford. We did not bother.
14/12/23, 4:02 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
14/12/23, 4:02 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 4:11 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Based on your explanation that its a learn and earn kind of arrangement, we feel we may struggle during the first years as he may by then not have earned many credits which may further reduce this balance. Knowing Wonderful, as he progresses in that arrangement, we believe the amount may be reduced. To answer on the affordability, yes we can.

But before concluding on the costs, what about the travelling costs? Who meets that cost?
14/12/23, 4:15 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Your confidence in Wonderful's progress and the potential reduction in costs over time is a positive perspective.
14/12/23, 4:15 pm - Kunal: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
14/12/23, 4:18 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Okay. This is well noted also. I just wanted clarification.
14/12/23, 4:19 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: For planning purposes
14/12/23, 4:19 pm - Kunal: That is absolutely fine, Mrs Catherine
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
14/12/23, 4:19 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
14/12/23, 4:19 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
14/12/23, 4:19 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
14/12/23, 4:19 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
14/12/23, 4:20 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 4:20 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
14/12/23, 4:20 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
14/12/23, 4:29 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Its a wonderful arrangement and very helpful, not only on the financial part but also experience and exposure to the part of the student.
14/12/23, 4:30 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
14/12/23, 4:31 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Well noted
14/12/23, 4:32 pm - +265 999 87 18 02: As you have indicated that scholarship ranges from 50% to 100% what's the criteria for one to attain either 50% or 100% scholarship?
14/12/23, 4:46 pm - Kunal: The final percentage of scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship
14/12/23, 4:46 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
14/12/23, 4:46 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
14/12/23, 4:47 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
14/12/23, 4:47 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
14/12/23, 5:04 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
14/12/23, 5:44 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Were travelling home
14/12/23, 5:44 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: But we are connected
14/12/23, 5:46 pm - Kunal: I understand
Can you participate?
14/12/23, 5:47 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: 4 is the most important
14/12/23, 5:47 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Yes
14/12/23, 5:47 pm - Kunal: Great!

14/12/23, 5:48 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Wonderful with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
14/12/23, 5:48 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: My husband must be in the road now hence  may respond or make his inquiries later if need be
14/12/23, 5:51 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Us his parents
14/12/23, 5:52 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Unless a well wisher comes along to help
14/12/23, 5:54 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
14/12/23, 6:23 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Its good. Infact its a privilege to him.
14/12/23, 6:31 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: It could also be helpful to know some months before the opening of the first semester if he has been considered and place secured to ensure ample time to prepare.
14/12/23, 6:32 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Like how long does the assessment take before Edoofa successfully identify and enroll the students?
14/12/23, 6:34 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: And what is the academic calendar like India. Like here in Malawi it runs from September - July. What is it like in India? And when are the successful students expected to go start their studies in India?
14/12/23, 6:36 pm - Kunal: We are about to finish this session in another 10-15 minutes and after that, in the next stage there will be an eligibility check process which you need to clear in order to be found eligible for the program
14/12/23, 6:37 pm - Kunal: Academic Calendar in India starts from August to May
14/12/23, 6:38 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
14/12/23, 6:38 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
14/12/23, 6:43 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities! Which ones are these?
14/12/23, 6:46 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Is it Government? Or School? Or a particular ministry?
14/12/23, 6:49 pm - Kunal: The Senior authorities can be the head of the school or any reputed people of the society
14/12/23, 6:49 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
14/12/23, 6:49 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
14/12/23, 6:49 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 6:53 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Okay
14/12/23, 6:58 pm - Kunal: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
14/12/23, 6:58 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
14/12/23, 6:58 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
14/12/23, 7:09 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: This is still within a month which may not be possible.
14/12/23, 7:09 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: For income like ours.
14/12/23, 7:16 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: A better arrangement, if we could propose, could be:

Since exams will be in June and July for MSCE, then soon after exams , say end July the process of paying the $350 can start. The exams could be out by October. Around that time, one can be ready with the air ticket and other logistics. This can allow the student to fly out by December or January to start the Earn before learning which could only start in August of the same year. This could be a flexible arrangement considering our income.
14/12/23, 7:17 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Hence at this point after assessment, it can be confirmed that the student is competent, and let the reservation letter be issued and payment effected after MSCE
14/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: Mrs. Catherine, we have an established program that operates in a structured manner and follows established protocols.
After being enrolled in the program, the student will be starting their Earn While You Learn program while being in the home country itself which means being in the country itself they can gain and earn scholarship credits by working on online projects and gain real-time experiences and practical skills.
As you know students will be back on their Christmas breaks and they will have mid-term vacations, so the students get a lot of time while being in the home country itself. So they can utilize this time to reduce the pressure on you since you already told me that you are not financially prepared for the same.

Also, you have the time of more than one year to prepare for it, and what if the child also contributes towards the preparation for the same otherwise how do you think within the span of a few months after getting the results you will be able to raise the finances?
14/12/23, 7:46 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: But in this one year he is busy with exams preparation. Like when he comes for Christmas, he will be busy with studies. Even when he comes for Easter holiday, that shall be critical time for his exams preparations and coupling it with online work it will disturb his attention.
14/12/23, 8:02 pm - Kunal: That is absolutely understandable
Let me tell you that whenever a child wishes to pause the session due to preparations of exams or any other reasons they can inform the mentors and can continue once they are available and it has been the same for other students from Malawi and different countries who are currently attending their exams or their schools
At the same time, you have to understand that we are receiving applications from 29 countries which is a huge number increasing each day and the seats are getting filled very soon because the 2024 and 2025 intakes are currently open and we are receiving applications from Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia, Malawi, etc and when you compare the curriculum of Malawi with other countries such as west Africa the results are out before the time Malawians receive the results. Therefore, there is a high probability that the seats might be occupied by students from other countries or even from the other students who are applying from Malawi itself 
Therefore, it is always advised to proceed at the earliest
14/12/23, 8:19 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Okay
14/12/23, 8:19 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Well noted.
14/12/23, 8:21 pm - Kunal: So, shall we complete this session to proceed with the application?
14/12/23, 8:22 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Yes
14/12/23, 8:23 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 8:33 pm - Kunal: I am expecting your response, please
14/12/23, 9:17 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 9:26 pm - +265 888 36 32 05: Alright . Blessed night
