14/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 078 0956: All those universities are in India?
14/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 078 0956: Isaac is an upper six student who is currently waiting for his results. He sat for Zimsec examinations this year. Do you have a minimum requirement in terms of the number of points for one to be able to secure your scholarships?
14/12/23, 3:36 pm - Kunal: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship.
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for a Board meeting. Let us connect at 5:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.
