I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about her achieving it
12/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 338 9207: Definitely.I am witnessing a lot of maturing and focus from the young girl.
12/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 338 9207: Sorry.Its maturity and focus.
12/12/23, 1:03 pm - Kunal: Alright, Based on my evaluation, considering her subjects, interests and passion, she is eligible to pursue

*Bachelor of Arts in Sociology*

The course covers aspects of Social Work offering a wide range of career and higher education opportunities
Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 338 9207: Yes.She was also interested in pursuing Social Behaviour Science in Smart Technology as said before that she is somebody interested in dealing with human change, relationship and may be to the extent of humanitarian situations.What I do not know is that a Degree in Sociology will not, given the Zimbabwean situation make her a mere high school teacher which will divert her deeper global ambitions.You can however, give deeper explanation of the Degree of Arts in Sociology.

*Career Options in Sociology*
Sociology, as a career, is both impactful and fulfilling. Many of us have aspired to make an impact on society and the career options in sociology bring this opportunity close.

Here are some of the most popular career options in sociology:

1. Social Worker
A career in helping people and improving societies, which pretty much defines a social worker, is the most sought-after job for sociology aspirants. Sociology graduates can use the knowledge of social dynamics to analyse social issues and find ways to help resolve them. Social workers refer issues to appropriate community agencies to ensure the allotment of resources to individuals and families in need.

2. Journalist
For candidates with a flair of writing and a good grasp of observing mass attitude and analyse social issues, journalism is the ideal option. Top news agencies and publications in India are always on the lookout for professionals adept in understanding social circumstances.

3. Administrative Support
Top educational institutions require professionals who can assess individual and mass psychology, understand human behaviour and troubleshoot issues. Sociologists can become a part of the administrative staff at schools, colleges, and universities.

4. Rehabilitation Counsellor
If you are inclined towards helping the youths of their society, this career option is ideal for you. Rehabilitation counsellors use their counselling techniques learned in sociology to guide youths who have been misled into making wrong decisions in life, who have committed a crime and have completed their penitence, and those who have been abused or traumatised by life events.

5. Family Counsellor
Sociologists are adept counsellors, and that’s why their expertise can be utilised in family counselling. Family counsellors use their observation and critical thinking to assess different familial or marital issues and provide guidance in mitigation.

6. Survey Researcher
As the name suggests, survey researchers conduct surveys to make various decisions. These include observing patterns of social and political issues, health and culture, and how consumers are reacting to a particular product or service. They create questionnaires, form focus groups, and get clear answers. Sociologists make use of data collection and statistical analysis techniques to gather evidence and create well-informed reports for public and private organisations.

7. Human Resources (HR) Specialist
A part of being a sociologist includes interacting with a large number of people every day. This is the foundation of being an HR specialist who analyses job roles, decides if a candidate is suitable for a particular job, interviews the candidates to arrive at a decision.

8. Policy Analyst
Sociologists have to study policies in their academic journey. That’s why they are hired as policy analysts to observe social issues and recommend legislators to address these issues. Sociologists can make use of their knowledge and skill to analyse sociological research data to understand if particular legislation has made a positive or negative impact on social issues and population

9. Media Planner
A media planner’s job entails figuring out a plan to advertise for a product or service for a client. This requires a good grasp of mass psychology, and sociologists are taught exactly that. Top companies require experts to create market surveys, analyse data, and help marketers create advertising campaigns

13/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 129 0541: According to the state we are in l don't think any of my family members will be able to pay it for me
13/12/23, 12:48 pm - Kunal: I can understand
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
13/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 129 0541: No
13/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 129 0541: How is it done
13/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
13/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
13/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
13/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
13/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
13/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
13/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
13/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 129 0541: l thought Edoofa will help me Archieve my goals and this l don't understand how l am supposed to do it
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - Kunal: Students are given real-time live online projects based on digital marketing, organization management to develop soft skills like communication skills, leadership, presentation skills, teamwork, etc.during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student's performance) which wouldn't be physical cash but they can contribute to a part of their higher education fees and make their university education even more affordable.
The working hours would be flexible and they would be able to make the free time productive.
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - Kunal: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
13/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Yah noted
13/12/23, 1:19 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
13/12/23, 1:19 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
13/12/23, 1:19 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
13/12/23, 1:19 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
13/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 129 0541: 4
13/12/23, 1:22 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.

13/12/23, 1:22 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
13/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 129 0541: l selected 4, Higher Education Concierge
13/12/23, 1:24 pm - Kunal: Yes Diana
13/12/23, 1:25 pm - Kunal: You can address this
13/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Ok l get it so what's the next step to be taken
13/12/23, 1:26 pm - Kunal: I will be guiding you further with the process
13/12/23, 1:26 pm - Kunal: Before that please respond to the question
13/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Now my father is unavailable but I think when he comes back he will be able to answer that
13/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
13/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 129 0541: My family will be very happy for me to learn abroad and will be greatful to you they wish for a better life of mine and to archieve my goals
13/12/23, 1:33 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
13/12/23, 1:33 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
13/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 129 0541: l will give you tonight
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kunal: Diana, these are not required now, let me guide you ahead
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Ok l understand
13/12/23, 1:45 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
13/12/23, 1:45 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
13/12/23, 1:45 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/12/23, 2:02 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed
13/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Sorry network is tripping , yes we may
13/12/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 129 0541: We have discussed every stage but what l don't understand is l want to do Social work and lm being offered B.A. (Hons).in Sociology and even on finances l have not really understood that am l the one who is supposed to pay for my University
13/12/23, 2:29 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that we do not offer social work as a degree, but we do offer *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology*

The Bachelor of Arts in Sociology is a comprehensive program that encompasses various aspects of social work. This course not only provides a deep understanding of societal structures and dynamics but also offers a broad spectrum of career possibilities and avenues for further education. The curriculum equips students with the knowledge and skills necessary for a diverse range of professions within the field of sociology, opening doors to meaningful career opportunities and serving as a solid foundation for advanced studies in related disciplines.
13/12/23, 2:30 pm - Kunal: This fee is to be paid by the family of the student, please
13/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 129 0541: But if I will want to use it in Zimbabwe l will be a teacher not a social worker
13/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 129 0541: It will be difficult for them because there is still another sibling of mine still going to school so it will be very difficult
13/12/23, 2:45 pm - Kunal: May I know why?
13/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 129 0541: That's what I don't know but social  science
13/12/23, 4:37 pm - Kunal: Can you elaborate?
13/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 129 0541: They think Sociology is based on teacher job but is there any social sciences in any Universities in India
13/12/23, 4:51 pm - Kunal: May I know what motivated you for Social science?
13/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 129 0541: As per my own knowledge social science is the study of the social features of humans and the ways they interact. Mr and Mrs Mukutuma are my role models as they are involved in this. lm really interested in working at NGOs so as l was looking at Zimbabwe it has accepted mostly social science students than those of sociology
13/12/23, 5:36 pm - Kunal: Diana, let me help you understand it

Certainly, the perception that Sociology is exclusively linked to a career in teaching is a common misconception. In reality, Sociology as a social science discipline is offered as an academic field in numerous universities across India, providing diverse career paths beyond teaching
13/12/23, 5:37 pm - Kunal: *Social Services and NGOs:* Many sociology graduates find fulfilling careers in social services and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). They can work on community development projects, advocacy, and social welfare initiatives, making a tangible impact on society.
13/12/23, 5:37 pm - Kunal: *Human Resources and Management:* Understanding human behavior and societal dynamics is crucial in the business world. Sociology graduates are well-suited for roles in human resources, organizational development, and management, where their insights into social interactions can contribute to effective workplace dynamics.
13/12/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Oook now I understand thank you so much
13/12/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 129 0541: So l can do that programme
13/12/23, 5:40 pm - Kunal: Yes Diana
You are eligible for *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology*
13/12/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Thank you so much Mr Kunal l really appreciate the clearance you gave me
13/12/23, 5:42 pm - Kunal: I can understand
Did you understand and consider the benefits of EWYL program which can make your cost of education more affordable?
13/12/23, 5:42 pm - Kunal: You are welcome, Diana
13/12/23, 5:43 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Yah so what do l have to do to get connected to it
13/12/23, 5:53 pm - Kunal: If you are found eligible for the program and if you are enrolled to the program you will start your EWYL program while being in your country
13/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Ok sir thank you
13/12/23, 5:54 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 129 0541: l have seen it,EWYL is beneficial
13/12/23, 6:25 pm - Kunal: Indeed it is
13/12/23, 6:25 pm - Kunal: Please address this
13/12/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Yah now we have discussed everything thank you for now let's wait for my father
13/12/23, 8:08 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
13/12/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Yah
13/12/23, 8:16 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Yes you may
13/12/23, 8:16 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
13/12/23, 8:16 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.
13/12/23, 8:40 pm - Kunal: Are you clear with the process?
13/12/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 129 0541: Yes you have cleared
13/12/23, 8:42 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
13/12/23, 8:42 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

14/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 338 9207: Law is one of her two choices.Her first choice is Social Science followed by Law.  Are the universities covered by Endoofa offer Social Science?
14/12/23, 3:08 pm - Kunal: Mr. Tinashe, as per your understanding, which are the degrees that fall under Social Sciences?
14/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 338 9207: In terms of some of the Zimbabwean universities there is Social work,Social behaviour science in smart technology.However, the list is long.By mentioning Social Science as course does not limit the choices in course covered by the same ambrella subject course.By mentioning Social Science we are trying to be within the intended choices of the would be applicant.May be as you mentioned BA Arts in Sociology you can as well state some of  such related degrees.In our choice we do not a situation whereby some goes for training but comes back home with something that her unemployable or make her compromise her professional independence.In Zimbabwe things are not as rosy as abroad.Every course is applicable abroad but home its a different case altogether.Law being one of her choices is good but when done outside Zimbabwe one needs to do a conversion before practice.In our presentation we are trying by all means to be as relevant as possible.Sorry.We are not rigid in  our choices  but what need is to make informed decisions.

14/12/23, 5:55 pm - Kunal: I am really glad that you have a good understanding of the course and its different branches along with the career prospects. Now let me just inform you that Social science as you mentioned is a large umbrella with many branches such as Physiology, Sociology, Journalism, Law, Political Science, Geography, Economics, and History. Now all these courses are offered under the Edoofa scholarship program, now Social work is offered or included in the curriculum of Sociology. 
At the same time, when you look at a career like law, it's a larger course that is of 5 years of duration including other social sciences courses such as psychology and Sociology as well in the curriculum. Also to be a lawyer you need to have a wider perspective of different scenarios.
14/12/23, 5:55 pm - Kunal: At the same time, it is good to know that you have an understanding of how to practice law in Zimbabwe after graduating. It's true after completing the law from India the child will be evaluated by the BAR Council of Zimbabwe after which the child will be have an exam then they can practice law in Zimbabwe which wouldn't be a challenge because there is a proper process set for the same
14/12/23, 6:05 pm - Kunal: There are few courses in the field of Commerce and Law which have similar basics across the Globe but the syllabus varies based on the location where you study the course

Let us take the example of the law. The basics of law are the same if you study from Zimbabwe, India, the USA, the UK etc but vary in terms of the economy, governance of a country, legislation etc. Once the student completes the course and wants to practice in a different country, then the BAR Council of the country will evaluate the subjects of the students and there would be an exam which he/she needs to clear after which they can practice law in that country. This procedure is the same if you want to practice it in any country. The Indian law degree is internationally accredited and you can practice Globally
