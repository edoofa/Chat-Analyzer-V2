You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
12/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 461 7198: Yh I understand the program ms harmehak
12/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 461 7198: Yh that's my dream ms harmehak

12/12/23, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: Very well,

12/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Yes
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Alois, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Owk ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 461 7198: As for now  l live this opportunity to my father maybe he has some questions for you
12/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: He can surely share them please.
12/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Can I ask you something ms Harmehak ?
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 461 7198: I need to know the requirements for this scholarship
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Which requirements are you referring to, Alois?
12/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Meaning my number of points at A level ..
12/12/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Owk I get you now so are we still proceeding with the program or I finished my application
12/12/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: We are still in the Counseling session, Alois.
12/12/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Forensic Accounting?
12/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Owk ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 461 7198: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Accounting, Business study and Economics my A level combination
12/12/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please
12/12/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: What motivates you to study Forensic Accounting?
12/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 306 5310: Nothing Ms hamehak .we are together let's proceed with your questions
12/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Its like it is my dream since when I was little in primary level and some people say it is the best program in commercials..
12/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright please Mr Simon.
12/12/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: I would like to know your thoughts on the discussion so far and if you are willing to support Alois's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?
12/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 306 5310: This schoolar ship is it 100 percent to offer a students or  we share Ms hamehak .yes now I m working as a labour officer but we faced a challenge of financial to support my childrens .so I need a help to you to assist me and alois for a scholarship
12/12/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
12/12/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship please?
12/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 461 7198: I think he's trying to say the schoolaship is providing me everything in terms of fees and accommodation and stuff
12/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 306 5310: Yes correct
12/12/23, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 461 7198: I get you ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
12/12/23, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: So are you willing to support his education along with the scholarship, Mr Simon?
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 306 5310: Noted we are together Ms  harmehak I'm supporting his education
12/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 306 5310: I'm willing Ms harmehak
12/12/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please, Mr Simon.
12/12/23, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

On that note, let me brief you about your desired course, 

*Bachelor of commerce - Honors in Accounting*
12/12/23, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.

12/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Noted but these jobs are also found there in India
12/12/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 461 7198: That's great
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 306 5310: Wonderfully 👏
12/12/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
12/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright then Alois, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Maybe I will be someone who is self-esteem and making some money there because my I wish is to work there so that I will help my parents in Zimbabwe
12/12/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: That is great Alois, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 461 7198: I would like to study different languages and cultures and as for now in Zimbabwe I found it difficult to find a job after finishing my course because of corruption and stuff
12/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 461 7198: In addition some of the students in Zimbabwe who finish their coarse are not going work due lack of jobs in Zimbabwe so that's why I want to study abroad and work there
12/12/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: You see, Alois, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
12/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 461 7198: You see so it is better for me to study there and work there too
12/12/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Alois.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

13/12/23, 9:18 am - Harmehak: Wonderful,

So did you learn new things and find it interesting and helpful, Alois?
13/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 461 7198: Yes ms harmehak  I learn different things from shared information and pictures
13/12/23, 9:23 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Alois.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
13/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 461 7198: Maybe I can estimate the prices but I don't really research about it maybe today I can reaserch about it , give me that as a homework
13/12/23, 9:28 am - Harmehak: I understand please
13/12/23, 9:28 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/12/23, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/12/23, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

13/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 461 7198: Yh the price is affordable ms harmehak
13/12/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.
13/12/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are your thoughts on the same?
13/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 461 7198: So are you saying the fee is 3000 per year which includes accommodation, food and basic university expense right
13/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 461 7198: Tell me more about earn while program please
13/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 306 5310: Morning Ms harmehak
13/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 306 5310: Excellent 👏 so India is very cheap than all countries
13/12/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Yes please
13/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: I appreciate the same please.
13/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Surely please
13/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 461 7198: Owk
13/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 461 7198: Still waiting for you..
13/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
13/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
13/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

13/12/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

13/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: That is great, 

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
13/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 461 7198: Yes ms harmehak
13/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Alois, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
13/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
13/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 461 7198: So if a student apply for than 5 universities that means he/she must spent more than 1000 according to my own estimation
13/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 461 7198: For edoofa how much do you want for application only
13/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: They spend around $1500-2250 without Edoofa, Alois.
13/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 461 7198: Owk
13/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
13/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
13/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
13/12/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 461 7198: Yh ms harmehak but lets say I pay 350 for program fee and at the end the student face different challenges that causes her not to come there do refund the money back or...
13/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 461 7198: So when I we supposed to pay enrollment fee..
13/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 461 7198: *so when are we supposed to pay enrollment fee.
13/12/23, 11:15 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
13/12/23, 11:15 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
13/12/23, 11:15 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 461 7198: Yh this is goog ms harmehak
13/12/23, 11:21 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
13/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 461 7198: Excellent 👏
13/12/23, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
13/12/23, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
13/12/23, 11:21 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
13/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 461 7198: Yh I understand ms Harmehak
13/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 461 7198: Noted
13/12/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

13/12/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
13/12/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. Tomorrow, on *14-12-23* at 10:30 P.M. CAT, *Mr. Sahil, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*, will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision.

As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
14/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Yes we discuss about the program and to my own view the program is more beneficial because a single mother is managed to send 2 daughters for high education so as for me my parents is going to spent less through EWYL program

14/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Yh I know them sahil
14/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
14/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
14/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
14/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 21st  or 22nd December 2023 for $200 and the 21st  or 22nd of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 21st  or 22nd December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
