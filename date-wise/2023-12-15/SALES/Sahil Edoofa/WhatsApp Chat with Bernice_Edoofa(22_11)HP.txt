So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I understand that edoofa scholarship program is a foundation that provides financial assistance to students who are pursuing higher education while  learning abroad.
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Bernice, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
23/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Yes , she had also told me that the program is open to students of all nationalities and that the program also offers mentorship and support services to help students succeed in their studies.
23/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 367 1063: It really is a well established foundation.
23/11/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
23/11/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Bernice, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Sizane high school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
23/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Well I come from a family of 5 children and I am the fourth born .My father and mother are ministers of religion.My father's highest level of education is his theology degree which he attained at living waters college. Sizane high school charges students 260 USD for every term. I wish to study medicine when I get to varsity. I however haven't made up my mind on which path I would like to take in medicine. My hobbies include writing poetry, reading books and singing and doing voluntary work as well as activities such as public speaking and debate in my school community.
23/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 367 1063: My strengths include great time management skills and high organizational skill. My greatest strength however is public speaking which I know is a great tool when it comes to addressing people. In fact I recently took second place in a district competition out of 16 learners.
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed, Bernice, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

It's great to know of your talents, Bernice.
23/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Thank you. My weakness however is my great interested in voluntary work that sometimes I find it hard to balance my other priorities but I am a working on it with the use of a timetable and being organized
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: I can understand and I am delighted that you have such a kind heart, Bernice.
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Thank you once again
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: May I know more about your elder siblings, Bernice?
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Alright.What exactly would you like to know?
23/11/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Their highest education qualification and what profession are they currently in please?

23/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Is there anything else that you would like to know
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: No please
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: Well Bernice, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I believe education abroad is a life changing decision. It is not only a chance to learn in another country and also get a change in scenery but a chance to also learn the cultures and traditions of other races in the world. Learning abroad will also enable me to work at the same time learning as the situation economically in my country is unbearable.
23/11/23, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing Bernice as you have managed to express your thoughts well.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
23/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I am mentally prepared. This is because it has always been my dream since I was in diapers,to learn abroad and learn about different ethnic groups, races, cultures and traditions while pursuing my education
23/11/23, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Bernice,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 367 1063: My parents are willing and support me in everything that I try to do
23/11/23, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: It's great that they are supportive, Bernice
23/11/23, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
23/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I am
23/11/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
23/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 78 367 1063: O level results are 5Bs and 4Cs
23/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I want to study medicine because I want to bring happiness to people as I help them through their sicknesses by applying what I would have learnt during my years in learning.
23/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 367 1063: My A level combination comprises of biology, statistics, pure maths and chemistry
23/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Chemistry B
Biology C
Maths C
Ndebele B
Physics C
Geography B
Agriculture C
English B
Combined Science B
23/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I don't know if you'd like a picture
23/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I'm however going to be writing my zimsec examinations next year
23/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 367 1063: For advanced level
23/11/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Duly received and noted, Bernice!
23/11/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: So why didn't you pursue Physics instead of Statistics in your A level please?

Did you happen to research please?
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Actually those are the combinations that our school provides , there's my combination which I chose then theres physics , math, mechanics and chemistry or math, physics, mechanics and geo or math, biology, geo and statistics.
23/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!
23/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
23/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I did research with my teachers are they directed me to the biology class
23/11/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Its just that when I began my a level I didn't think that I'd be in contact with your foundation until I was told by Nokuthaba
23/11/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: I can understand, Bernice.
23/11/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
23/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Number 8 and 2 seems interesting
23/11/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: Very well, and what intrigued you towards these courses, Bernice?
23/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Just that my whole family has eye problems and it would be nice to know more about the eye and what can disrupt it off of its function
23/11/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright, I can understand, Bernice!

Let me brief you about both the courses, you can go through the description and get back to me.
23/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Alright
23/11/23, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor of Science in Optometry
*Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.

23/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I feel very much attracted to this course
23/11/23, 7:00 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

You can have a thorough reading and inform me if you wish to proceed ahead with the same course.
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I've got a question,so is there a post grad course after this
23/11/23, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: You can surely pursue Post Graduation, Bernice.

That would be a personal choice.
23/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Alright I would love to pursue this in the long run if I'm running with this foundation.
23/11/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
23/11/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Bernice, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Edoofa program will help me achieve my dreams by funding me and mentoring me up until the end of my course. In 5 years time, I'd probably be looking for a job since the course is of 4 years duration. Maybe I'd already have a job and be financially stable and independent with the ability to cater for my family's needs.
23/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Apart from the financial benefits, I envision myself as a person who would have acquired great interpersonal skills as well as educationional skills
23/11/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Bernice, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Can you please elaborate where you mentioned the program would be funding you please?
23/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I meant that from what I understood the program will provide financial assistance during the duration of the course
23/11/23, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
23/11/23, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I want to study abroad because at the moment, Zimbabwe's economy seems to be slipping by the day and I'd like to go to a country which has a rather better economy. In addition, studying abroad will help me interact with students from other countries as I realized in the video that there is a diversity of races and this would benefit me as I would learn aboutots of cultures as well as achieve my course
23/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: You see, Bernice, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
23/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I understand what you mean. Life is tough on both ends  and it is true that the grass is always greener on the other side
23/11/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Bernice.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
23/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I have learnt that india has one of the best educational medicine facilities and that is what enticed me at most
23/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct
23/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

Let me also show you some facts about India and several global leaders who are Indian graduates.
23/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 367 1063: These are even greater reasons why one would want to learn in India
23/11/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Bernice

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Yes , many have told me that the cost of living abroad costs an arm and a leg
23/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 367 1063: As well ws education
23/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: I can understand
23/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 367 1063: India definitely seems to be the better option
23/11/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/11/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
23/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I think you're doing a great job and making it easy for students with the capable abilities to acquire education and that speaks volumes about the type of work that you do.
23/11/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Bernice
23/11/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: Bernice, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
23/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 78 367 1063: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I agree the cost of living has spiked in Zimbabwe. It is even harder for students coming from families which are struggling
23/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, Bernice 

I hope now you can relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India and providing an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program as well?
23/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Yes, I understand
23/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail.
23/11/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

23/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 367 1063: This is great because students get to earn as they learn, I think this is a perfect balance of what school is supposed to be like. It seems there's a plethora of skills to be learnt at edoofa
23/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Bernice!
23/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Well received, I definitely understand what you are saying
23/11/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Honestly this is motivating
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Bernice, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Ready
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: Bernice, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/11/23, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 78 367 1063: 2 250
23/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: You see, Bernice, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I think the same as you do, the foundation is trying by all means to make students life better
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Alright, I understand
23/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I have understood
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Alright I will speak to her as soon as possible
23/11/23, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: Do connect her with your parents too
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 12:30 PM CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2. He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

I wish you all a blessed evening ahead and a happy family discussion, please!
23/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Have a blessed evening too
23/11/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: Thank you, Bernice!
24/11/23, 12:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
24/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Good morning
24/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Yes we are good to go
24/11/23, 1:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
24/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 367 1063: It went well
24/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 367 1063: All my questions were effectively answered
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 367 1063: No I haven't, actually I have decided to take a different route from edoofa because yesterday during the counselling session with ma'am I found out that I cannot study medicine due to my combination and I decided that I would not be able to compromise after thinking things thouroughly hence the decision in taking a different path.
24/11/23, 3:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you elaborate? Which subject do you have ?
24/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 367 1063: My subjects are biology, pure math, statistics and chemistry
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns. I understand that the counseling session revealed challenges related to your subject combination and your desire to pursue medicine. Your thoughtful consideration of your academic path is commendable.

Regarding your subjects (biology, pure math, statistics, and chemistry), it's unfortunate that there are specific global criteria for medical and engineering courses. These criteria are universally established, mandating Physics, Chemistry, and Biology at the A-Level for healthcare courses and Physics and Maths for engineering courses.
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: It's crucial to underscore that these criteria are not set by Edoofa but adhere to global standards. We appreciate your dedication to your academic journey and stand ready to support you in exploring alternative paths that align with your goals. Should you have any further questions or if there's anything else we can assist you with, please feel free to reach out.

Your trust in Edoofa is highly valued. It's essential to clarify that eligibility for studying medicine adheres to universal standards, and reputable institutions would not mislead students on this matter. Edoofa, being a government-registered organization, is committed to providing honest guidance.
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: If someone claims you are eligible for studying medicine without meeting the necessary criteria, it is likely an attempt to deceive and exploit financially. Edoofa places a strong emphasis on transparency in our processes. It's important to understand that even completing a medical course from a third-grade university may pose challenges in obtaining a practicing license, as medical boards typically do not approve licenses for individuals who haven't met the required standards.

Our commitment to transparency has earned us recognition from education ministries, including your country's education ministry, and the support of the First Lady of Zimbabwe. If you have further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We are here to guide you honestly and ensure that your educational journey aligns with your aspirations.

24/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 367 1063: I understand that edoofa is a legit foundation and I don't doubt that at all if anything yesterday I got to understand how it works and how it tries by all means to ensure a smooth ride for students as they pursue their higher education, however according to my understanding I thought that the parameters for my inability to study medicine without physics lie within India only hence I thought that I should rethink things thouroughly
24/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 367 1063: Please do correct me if I'm wrong because according to my understanding the parameters here were set in India
24/11/23, 4:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please reframe your question are you concerned about the course offered and do you wish to change it ?
24/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 367 1063: No I mean to say that I thought that the need for all science subjects gor me to study medicine was only based in India.
