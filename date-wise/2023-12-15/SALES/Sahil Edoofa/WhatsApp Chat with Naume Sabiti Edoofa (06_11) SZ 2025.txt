Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
06/12/23, 9:20 pm - +263 71 434 8309: There is a bit different since a student who have access to a scholarship have the room to attain better standards as compared to the one who doesn't have access to a scholarship
06/12/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Naume! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
06/12/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
06/12/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
06/12/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 434 8309: Yes it is affordable
06/12/23, 9:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Naume. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
06/12/23, 9:46 pm - +263 71 434 8309: Yes go ahead sir
06/12/23, 9:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Naume. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/12/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
06/12/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

06/12/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
06/12/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 434 8309: This is good and very beneficial
06/12/23, 10:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 10:30 pm - +263 71 434 8309: Thank you sir
07/12/23, 8:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Success is not just about reaching the destination; it's about enjoying the journey and learning from every step along the way." - John C. Maxwell*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
07/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 434 8309: Yes I'm ready
07/12/23, 9:05 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Naume!
07/12/23, 9:05 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
07/12/23, 9:05 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
07/12/23, 9:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
07/12/23, 9:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

07/12/23, 9:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
07/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 434 8309: This is helpful
07/12/23, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
07/12/23, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
07/12/23, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
07/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 434 8309: I appreciate the Earn While You Learn
07/12/23, 11:31 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
07/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 71 434 8309: They are happy with the program and they are encouraging me not to give up
07/12/23, 11:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
07/12/23, 11:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
07/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 434 8309: Also A level result slip
07/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 434 8309: Visa or passport
07/12/23, 11:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
07/12/23, 11:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
07/12/23, 11:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 11:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
07/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 71 434 8309: So $750 is for enrollment only
07/12/23, 12:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
07/12/23, 12:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
07/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 434 8309: That's clear now
07/12/23, 1:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
07/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 434 8309: Ok Edoofa Program helps in reducing enrollment fees and there is a period for parents to pay the fee.
07/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 434 8309: And also the prices are not too much
07/12/23, 2:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

Are you ready?
08/12/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 434 8309: We discussed 2 phases which is Personalized counseling session and Eligibility check test and interview . We are going to phase 3
08/12/23, 8:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Naume!
08/12/23, 8:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
08/12/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 434 8309: Good evening
08/12/23, 8:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: We are left with Step 5 and Step 6.
So shall I explain them to you, please?
08/12/23, 9:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 3:49 am - +263 71 434 8309: Yes sir
09/12/23, 9:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The greatest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams." - Oprah Winfrey*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
09/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 71 434 8309: Yes I'm ready
09/12/23, 10:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Naume!
09/12/23, 10:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
09/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 434 8309: Sure. Thank you sir
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

13/12/23, 9:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you tell me:-

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
13/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 434 8309: 1. Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law

2. India.

13/12/23, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are parents ready for the same, please?

13/12/23, 10:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can they please acknowledge this question using voice notes, please?
13/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 340 4868: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
13/12/23, 10:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
13/12/23, 10:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
13/12/23, 10:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:51 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 20th or 21st December 2023 for $200 and the 20th or 21st of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 20th or 21st December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
13/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 340 4868: Now I'm not financially prepared but starting from February
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what challenges are you facing, please?
13/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 340 4868: I need to pay school fees for five students before 20 January . So the amount is ranging to $3000
13/12/23, 12:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand from our conversation that the recent completion of Naume's fee formalities has posed some challenges for you in meeting the enrollment deadlines. I have taken the liberty of discussing this with the Academic Board, and we have come up with a suitable solution. Would it be convenient for you to discuss this further at your earliest convenience? Your cooperation is highly appreciated.
13/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 340 4868: Thank you sir.
13/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 340 4868: So when l finish this l will pay the enrollment fee
13/12/23, 1:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know when will you be financially prepared, please?
13/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 340 4868: End of January
13/12/23, 1:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Naume, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Naume's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
13/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 340 4868: Ok so do you agree that we can pay the enrollment fee end of January
13/12/23, 1:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge this question, please?
13/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 340 4868: If you extend the timeline we will manage
13/12/23, 1:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I did discuss about Naume's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tshuma's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
13/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 434 8309: Ok that's better
