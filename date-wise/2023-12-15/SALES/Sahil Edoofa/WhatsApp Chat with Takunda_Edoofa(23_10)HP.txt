Attended the first four years of high school up to Ordinary level at Moleli high school from 2018 to 2021then transferred to the sister school Sandringham high for Advanced level in 2022 and am writing my final exams at the moment. Sandringham fees I last paid was at $684. I wish to study Software engineering in Varsity. I am currently doing a combination of Mathematics , business Studies and Computer Science.I am involved in leadership activities , debate, public speaking andLeo club. I enjoy coding. I am an attentive learner, work under pressure , I think outside the box and I believe I am open to gaining exposure. However i have only one parent since my mother died in 2021 so that may become a financial burden on my father.

25/10/23, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: I was hoping we could connect for a discussion, however I understand there must have been a reason for your unavailability, so I would be scheduling our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours for the day are over.

I wish you a blessed evening ahead.

Following would be the link to our Instagram account:

25/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Very sorry...was engaged in meetings during the day.Its fine we can have the discussion tomorrow
25/10/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand please
26/10/23, 9:09 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
26/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 280 2690: Good morning
26/10/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: How are you doing today Mr Moloten?
26/10/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 280 2690: Am good and yourself?
26/10/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: I am doing well, Thank you
26/10/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Did you happen to go through our Instagram account?
26/10/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 280 2690: Yes indeed I went through and saw the amazing testimonies and students you have worked with.Must admit you are doing a great job.
26/10/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: I greatly appreciate your kind words.
26/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 280 2690: Now out of interest...In my case where my son is currently writing his A-Levels.What us the qualification criteria for one to be eligible for a scholarship?
26/10/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Did you happen to go through the shared information as well please?
26/10/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

However we always encourage our students to aim for best results and put in their best efforts!
26/10/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 280 2690: Oh okay..So how does the application process proceed from now?
26/10/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: We are now in the discussion for the same itself please.
26/10/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: Mr Moloten, moving ahead Takunda happened to share his interests to pursue Software Engineering, and that his subjects are Mathematics, Business studies and Computer science.
26/10/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: Are you aware of the same?
26/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 280 2690: Yes that is correct
26/10/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, 

Mr Moloten, however did you or Takunda ever happened to research about the requirements for engineering?
26/10/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 280 2690: You will forgive us on that.. Currently he is at boarding school and busy with his final exams and we had not done a deep research on his preferred field.Would really appreciate if you could assist in that regard that is if you can
26/10/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand please and I am here to assist!
26/10/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
26/10/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: To pursue Engineering in Zimbabwe as well, physics is a mandatory requirement.
26/10/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Thank you..which means we do not qualify for the Software Engineering programe.Is that right?
26/10/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 280 2690: As experts in this career selection field.. What other program options are available within your institutions that he can pursue.Feel free to list as many options so that we assist him in selection.
26/10/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

Considering his subjects and interests, he can pursue the following!

*Bachelor of science in computer science*
*Bachelor in Computer Applications*

May I know which course shall I brief you about?
26/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Both please .if you may

26/10/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand please, he was in a discussion with Mr earlier as well!
26/10/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Here at Edoofa, the board has given the privilege to the students to change their program even after being accepted!
26/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Right let's talk finances.What are your expectations from us the applicants.Are there some application fees required so that we plan accordingly?

26/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Thanks for the resource material will go through it.
26/10/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 280 2690: So in this case are there any chances that we can secure a fully funded scholarship?
26/10/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
26/10/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
26/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Noted..is it possible to provide tuition fees schedules for your institutions so that we may be guided accordingly
26/10/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
26/10/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moloten, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
26/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Yes we have an idea having looked at other countries during our research.
26/10/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: That's great, could you please share your knowledge?
26/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 280 2690: In Poland for example..an international student at a public University can study for 2000 Euros first degree per year.
26/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Australia 20k to 45k AUD for Bachelors degrees
26/10/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please!
26/10/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Duly noted.
26/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 280 2690: So to wind up today's meeting..Kindly guide me on to the next step.I think I have asked all I needed to clarify.Am about to go for a work engagement let's kindly wind up.
26/10/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/10/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/10/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/10/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Considering the same, I would be discussing the details of the Earn While You Learn Program and the application process.

The discussion is left for about an hour!
26/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Thanks for taking your time to enlighten me on the programme.Lets link up tomorrow for the other part.
Much appreciated
26/10/23, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome please!

May I know if you can manage time today as well?

I would be sharing the resources regarding the Earn While You Learn Program, you can go through the same and then there would be a 20 minutes discussion regarding application.
26/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Sadly will only be available later in the evening.But you can send any information that you feel is essential and will go through after hours
26/10/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
26/10/23, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
26/10/23, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

26/10/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/10/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: Hello Takunda and Mr Moloten
26/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Hello
26/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 870 7015: hello
27/10/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Good afternoon Mr Moloten and Takunda
27/10/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Are we good to proceed ahead with the discussion?
27/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 870 7015: Yes I'm available at the moment
27/10/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/10/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 870 7015: Yes
27/10/23, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So Takunda, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
27/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 870 7015: Yes
27/10/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Takunda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
27/10/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 870 7015: Roughly around $1500
27/10/23, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/10/23, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
27/10/23, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: Takunda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
27/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 870 7015: Yes
27/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 870 7015: It is indeed evolving the system of things
27/10/23, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/10/23, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
27/10/23, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 870 7015: Okay
27/10/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
27/10/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
27/10/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
27/10/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 870 7015: Okay yes
28/10/23, 8:53 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
28/10/23, 8:53 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
28/10/23, 8:53 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
28/10/23, 8:53 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/10/23, 8:53 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
28/10/23, 8:53 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

29/10/23, 6:31 am - Harmehak: Alright please
29/10/23, 6:32 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
29/10/23, 6:32 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
29/10/23, 6:32 am - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

30/10/23, 11:19 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
30/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Afternoon.. Sorry was busy.Now on lunch break..can we proceed if it's okay
30/10/23, 1:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
30/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 280 2690: The session went well.She was very helpful and gave us enough information.Much appreciated
30/10/23, 1:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
30/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 280 2690: We haven't been in touch yet but will do so.
30/10/23, 1:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know the reason for the same ?
30/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Thought you were just using her as a reference and as someone we can call for clarification which we shall do later on unless if you are saying there is no proceeding before we speak to her?
30/10/23, 1:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

I hope your weekend provided you with the opportunity to rejuvenate. Are you ready to continue our session for today?
06/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Good day.Takunda is currently busy with his final exams and won't be available daily for these sessions.
I also feel the process really needs time and we are not sure how long these sessions are going to run for.I was of the opinion that we reschedule them to after 24 November when he has completed his finals.
Our current situation in the country sometimes we experience electricity loadshedding and he is hardly available due to power challenges.
Otherwise we really appreciate the effort you are putting in engaging us and also the possibilities that lie ahead as Edoofans.
06/11/23, 1:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please as parents can you continue the session in students absence ?

15/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Oh okay
15/11/23, 4:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So are you ready for the same ?
15/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Let's move forward
15/11/23, 4:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
15/11/23, 4:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
15/11/23, 4:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 4:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
15/11/23, 4:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 4:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 20th or 21th November 2023 for $200 and the 20th or 21th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 20th or 21th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
15/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Let me get back to you.Weighing the options

How are you doing today ?
27/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Morning
27/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 280 2690: We are doing fine
27/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 870 7015: How are you
27/11/23, 6:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I apologize for the delay today; unfortunately, I'm not feeling well. We'll have to reschedule today's session, and I'll reconnect with you tomorrow at 11:30 PM CAT time
27/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 870 7015: okay, wishing you a speedy recovery
28/11/23, 10:40 am - Sahil Edoofa: Thank you
28/11/23, 10:40 am - Sahil Edoofa: Let me guide you about the payment modes in depth .
28/11/23, 10:40 am - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
28/11/23, 10:40 am - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

30/11/23, 8:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: @263772802690 Could you kindly provide details about your preparations? It's crucial for me to update the board in advance, especially if there's a need for extensions. Today marks the last day, and without prior discussion, there's a risk of your seat being canceled. I appreciate your cooperation in sharing any concerns you may have.

08/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 280 2690: *My Assessment of Edoofa*

There is absolutely no doubt now that your organisation is legit and assists a lot of students to access affordable tertiary education and I commend you for that.You are really bridging an important gap and making university education affordable especially for students coming from troubled economies like ours.
My assessment on the whole recruitment process that we recently underwent is...Please kindly tone it down on over referring us to local people.Whilst it is a noble initiative I found it overbearing to a large extent.
The reason I slowed down on initiating my payment was when I received a local call from a local woman whom you referred to talk to me about depositing money into your account.I raised my concerns about such 'red flags' typically used by some scammers who use such modus operandi where they connive with local accomplices to convince.
2)While appreciating the effort to assist us in avoiding exorbitant bank transfer charges.I also found it as a 'red flag' your referring us to deposit funds in a someone's personal Nostro Account domiciled here.Nomatter how authentic he may be..for some people like us who have been victims of scams before..it triggers wrong signals.
3)Finally would appreciate if you could send me a list of the Universities that you recruit on behalf of so that I make an informed decision based on their location,quality and rankings.

Otherwise apart from my above comments,I have no doubt that you guys are legit and have assisted lots of people.These are my humble submissions
08/12/23, 3:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: We acknowledge that not everyone has access to international bank accounts, and our intention in providing local payment options is to facilitate a smoother process for those facing such constraints.
08/12/23, 3:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: In response to your concerns:

Referring to Local Contacts: The reason behind connecting you with local individuals, such as Mr. Charles, a retired education officer, is to offer trustworthy options for payment. We understand the sensitivity around financial transactions, especially in the context of past scams. However, please be assured that these individuals are trusted associates, often with affiliations to reputable schools, and are part of our effort to make the payment process more accessible.
08/12/23, 3:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Deposit into Personal Nostro Account: We fully understand your apprehension about depositing funds into a personal Nostro account. This is done to address the challenges some parents face with high international transfer fees. We want to emphasize that the individuals involved are vetted, and your security is a top priority. If you are uncomfortable with this method, you can opt for alternative payment methods through our official website (www.Edoofa.com) or through a PayPal invoice issued by Edoofa.
08/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 280 2690: Thanks for the response.A d the last part on list of universities?
