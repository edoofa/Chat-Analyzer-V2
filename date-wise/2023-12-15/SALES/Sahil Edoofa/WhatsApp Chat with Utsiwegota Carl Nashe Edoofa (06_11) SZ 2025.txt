Carl is my first born and I also see him as a leader. I always encourage him to do his school work and proceed with his education so that one day he's going to change our life.

I always tell him that, no matter what circumstances we have and never look at our background, you can pass and make it in life so that one day you will help your mother and father in fact you'll raise your family higher
06/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your unwavering determination to provide a brighter future for your son through education is genuinely commendable.

08/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 71 845 5174: Good morning good people
08/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 845 5174: Yes sir am ready

08/11/23, 11:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Carl. Can you please acknowledge this question?
08/11/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 895 9101: I love software engineering because it helps me be more creativity. The more creative i become is the more i know how to solve some problems. There is also job variety as i can work on big companies that are highly paid. There's also room for freedom because work will be done on my laptop at home. It doesn't necessarily require to be in an office or at industry i can do the work in my room.
08/11/23, 11:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The prospect of working with esteemed companies and enjoying high pay is indeed appealing, and the flexibility to work remotely from your own space provides a valuable sense of freedom and work-life balance. Software engineering is undoubtedly a versatile and promising career choice, and it's wonderful to see your enthusiasm for it, Carl!
08/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 71 895 9101: When it comes to sound technology i really appreciate the music industry as i am more into it. I would like to introduce and mix different sound.
08/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Carl. Could you kindly share your specific role within the field? Are you primarily involved in production, vocal mixing, mastering, or instrumental mixing?
08/11/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 895 9101: I am primarily involved in vocal mixing, instrumental mixing and making beats
08/11/23, 12:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is truly impressive, Carl! May I know what DAW you use, please?
08/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 895 9101: I have in my phone an application called bandlab and groovepad which i use during my spare time
08/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Carl. Bandlab is undeniably a portable application that offers artists the convenience of hands-on experience and portability, enhancing their creative process. However, may I know whether you have tried your hands on more advanced DAWs like FL Studio or Ableton, please?
08/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 71 895 9101: No i have never had of these DAWs can i know better
08/11/23, 12:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Carl. However, may I know your favourite artists or producers, please?
08/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 895 9101: My favourite artists is Dababy, burna boy and 2pac
08/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 895 9101: Whereas my best producer is Tyler
08/11/23, 12:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is indeed an excellent choice, Carl! May I know what is your favourite album of Tyler, please?
08/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 895 9101: Wusyaname
08/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say that you have impeccable taste, Carl! In my personal perspective, YoungBoy's feature was undeniably one of the standout performances on 'Call Me If You Get Lost.' I'd like to share some insights into Tyler's music production. He frequently utilizes Logic Pro X for crafting his beats, a software exclusively available on Macintosh platforms. Interestingly, many of the tracks on 'Igor' and 'Call Me If You Get Lost' can also be created using FL Studio or Ableton. Additionally, Tyler, drawing inspiration from artists like Kanye West, often incorporates Pro Tools and Logic into his workflow. Pro Tools, in particular, plays a significant role in vocal processing. It's worth noting that several renowned producers, including Metro Boomin, Boi-1da (known for his work with Drake), and Hit-Boy (notably for his executive production on Nas's 'King's Disease' series), favor FL Studio for their production work!
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 895 9101: Okay Mr Shashwat, thank you, you have made it clear to me. I like researches so am gonna research more on Fl studio and make love to it so that i will be greater than Metro boomin lol. The challenge now hear in Zimbabwe is that there are no qualified mentos on mastering music and lack of best gadgets for quality projects.
08/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Carl. The most remarkable aspect of these producers is their exceptional ability to stand out in a crowded field. Metro Boomin's talent for adding a unique crispness to snares and infusing his instrumentals with a distinct grimy vibe is truly impressive. Hit Boy's unwavering command of boom bap is a testament to his consistency in the industry. Kanye West's ingenious use of Chipmunk Sampling and Future's pioneering of the Mumble Rap genre have left an indelible mark on the music world. I firmly believe that if you begin to explore and experiment with various musical genres, you have the potential to discover your very own, distinctive sound. For instance, consider the collaboration between Burna Boy and Dave. While Burna Boy is known for his smooth flow on afrobeats, he demonstrated remarkable versatility on an RnB beat, and the result was nothing short of amazing. This kind of experimentation and versatility can lead to the development of a truly unique musical style!
08/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now moving on with the session, you mentioned your flare for Software Development. May I know whether you have any prior experience with the a framework or language, please?
08/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 895 9101: I have not yet experience the languages but i have some few programming languages that i know but am sure i will get to know them very well when i learn them at school. So far i heard of Python, java script, java and C# which is mainly used in gaming
08/11/23, 3:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Carl. However, big-budget games often use engines like the Frostbite Engine (FIFA 24)
08/11/23, 3:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Carl. As your *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide you towards a path that caters to your aspirations. I have analyzed your endeavors and career inclinations. According to my expertise, this program will perfectly align with your magnificent vision

Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
14/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 895 9101: Ibam not familiar with that information
14/11/23, 9:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Carl! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
14/11/23, 9:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 9:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
14/11/23, 9:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
14/11/23, 10:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information, please?
14/11/23, 11:07 pm - +263 71 895 9101: I will kindly inform my father, nowadays he's offline. If he can afford
14/11/23, 11:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know when you will be having a discussion with him, please?
14/11/23, 11:09 pm - +263 71 895 9101: Tomorrow midday
14/11/23, 11:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 11:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

15/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Carl!
15/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have read this message, please?
15/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 71 895 9101: Yes i read it
15/11/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 895 9101: I think the fees will be affordable with an advantqge of earn while you learn program. So that reduced fees may be affordable in my family sir.
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Carl. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
15/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 895 9101: Yes i would like that
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Carl. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
15/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 71 895 9101: I appreciate the EWYL program, it can help me gain more industrial knowledge and help my parents pay fees etc.
15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
15/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 895 9101: I have seen a clear picture of the program, i appreciate all the good work done by the above students.
15/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is good to know, Carl. May I know whether you think it is affordable now?
15/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 895 9101: Yes the prices are affordable
15/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
15/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
15/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
15/11/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 895 9101: I appreciate the EWYL program most
15/11/23, 10:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
15/11/23, 11:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 11:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
16/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 895 9101: Yes i am ready
16/11/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 845 5174: We are looking forward to seeing our son studying abroad and pesue his dreams and get good employment. So as far as I see the counseling, meanwhile the Edoofa is the best of the scholarship and it's affordable and reliable. To the most fact of the EWYL program, I appreciate the program.
16/11/23, 12:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Carl and Mrs. Mable!
16/11/23, 12:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate his career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling him to independently support his family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for his parents.
16/11/23, 12:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
16/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 895 9101: Okay so all these are written manually???
16/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 895 9101: Yah i think so, it is
16/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Carl. You will be glad to know that we here at Edoofa have a dedicated team that will help you with your *Statement of Purpose* as well as the *Letter of Recommendation* !
16/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
16/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
16/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*

Because of the high number of applications we have received for 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In these large number of applications I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
21/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 71 845 5174: Hie Mr Shashwat, we are sorry for not coming through for the past 5 days. Both of our phones were were stolen during a break in which happened at night on Friday. So I have recovered my phone and Carl will be definitely online tomorrow morning.

22/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I'm truly sorry to hear about the break-in incident, and I can only imagine how unsettling it must have been for you both. I'm relieved to hear that you've recovered your phone, Mrs. Mayble. May I know whether everything is alright now, please?
22/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 845 5174: Indeed everything is okay now
22/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Mrs. Mable!
22/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Carl and Mrs. Mable! <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during a previous session, please?
22/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 585 5336: Yes that was understood
22/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 585 5336: We can proceed
22/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
22/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
22/11/23, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Utsiwegota Carl Nashe Edoofa (06/11) SZ" to "Utsiwegota Carl Nashe Edoofa (06/11) SZ 2025"
22/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 585 5336: Understood sir
22/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
22/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 585 5336: Firstly,i see edoofa as a best because it has reliable fees to us with the Earn While you Learn program. The Earn While you Learn program helps us with scholarship credits to help my parents financially. It also helps me in having experience in industry. I have understood that we should pay $350 for the enrollment of the scholarship seat and EWL program within 7 days.
22/11/23, 4:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
22/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 585 5336: Thank you i now have a clear picture of the financial aspects
22/11/23, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 585 5336: So far we have discussed through personalised counselling session,, Eligebility Check Test and Interview,,, Acceptence into the Edoofa Program and am am at the Enrollment into the Edoofa program stage
22/11/23, 5:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
22/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 585 5336: Okay we can proceed
22/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
22/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 585 5336: Yes i am cleared now
22/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

23/11/23, 3:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
23/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 585 5336: Yes we chatted with her yesterday and she told me her experience through the Edoofa program. She told me that Edoofa is not a spam also its real and made her kids persue for their dreams.

How are you doing today?
28/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 398 2421: Good morning sir
28/11/23, 12:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
28/11/23, 12:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 4th or 5th  December 2023.

01/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 845 5174: Fine n you
01/12/23, 2:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through your acceptance letter ?
01/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 398 2421: Yes we've gone through it,everything it fine
01/12/23, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you have any questions for me ?
01/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 398 2421: The program of earn while you learn can u explain again how it functions
01/12/23, 3:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program is a unique opportunity where students gain practical work experience through real-time online projects. By actively participating in projects related to skills like research, content writing, digital marketing, and more, students not only enhance their skills but also earn scholarship credits. These credits can significantly reduce their higher education fees, making it more affordable.

Additionally, the EWYL program opens doors to collaborations with prominent brands, job opportunities through recruitment partners, and insightful webinars by industry leaders. The program empowers students to learn, earn, and become market-ready professionals.

In terms of affordability, a student's ability to earn scholarship credits is not limited, and their dedication to the EWYL program can substantially contribute to covering their annual fees. This financial flexibility, combined with the installment options for fee payments, provides students with a pathway to affordable higher education.

Overall, students who actively engage in the EWYL program tend to build a robust skill set, enhance their employability, and successfully earn scholarship credits.
01/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 398 2421: Thank u now I understand
01/12/23, 4:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Any other questions you have for me ?
01/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 398 2421: At the moment no question sir
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
01/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 398 2421: Yes u can
01/12/23, 5:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
01/12/23, 5:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
