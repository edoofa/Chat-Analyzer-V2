She also told me about some students who are already in India like Abigail Bidi and she shared Abigail' s experience with Edoofa scholarship program that she was guided from counseling sessions upto visa. When Abigail arrived in India the Edoofa team collected her from airport to to respective university for Free. The other thing is Edoofa scholarship program offers non academic sessions which nature the Edoofians preparing for their future.
