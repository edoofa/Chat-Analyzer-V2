*“It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/12/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 706 9620: Good morning
05/12/23, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Seline, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Denzel, is that correct?
05/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 706 9620: Yes
05/12/23, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Denzel, also do tell me whether you learnt about Denzel’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
05/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 706 9620: I learnt that Edoofa caters for everything and it is unique for focusing on employability through earn while you learn program
This makes it a successful gateway to a successful career.
05/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
05/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 706 9620: Yes it is
05/12/23, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Seline, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 706 9620: Yes I do
05/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
05/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Now Seline, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?

05/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 706 9620: My name is Seline Anotida Mutsvangwa. I am eighteen years old now and I will be turning nineteen this December. I live in Chinhoyi in Zimbabwe. I'm the second born in a family of three. My elder sister is now married and my younger sister is in grade five. My father is a soldier and my mother is a housewife. For my A'level, I studied at Nemakonde high school in Mashonaland West province and my per-term fee was 60USD. I did pure mathematics, chemistry and biology. My favourite subjects were biology and chemistry. I would like to pursue medicine and major . My parents have been supporting me for my education so far and my mother went to university and secured a diploma in business studies whilst my father went to air force training and became a soldier. I would hope for the Edoofa program to help me financially for my higher education abroad.
05/12/23, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Seline, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: So I would like to know that if you have any other interest.
05/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 706 9620: I did study chemistry and biology. So you mean I cannot do a medicinal course because I did not do physics?
05/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
05/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 706 9620: What about veterinary science? Can I pursue veterinary science
05/12/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Without Physics, any healthcare-related subject cannot be pursued.
05/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Ok can u suggest some good courses for me based on my subjects then maybe I can select one from them
05/12/23, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: The suitable course would be:
1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

05/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 706 9620: No but the report books were written on the closing day so I'm guessing my maths teacher didn't get time to write some of the report books

08/12/23, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: So Shall I brief you about the course?
08/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 706 9620: Yes
08/12/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: *Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.
08/12/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.
08/12/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.
08/12/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.
08/12/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.

08/12/23, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
08/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Yes
08/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 706 9620: As a future optometrist, I see myself as someone who can help improve people's lives by providing them with the best possible vision care.  I envision myself as a skilled and compassionate professional, who will be able to use my knowledge and training to diagnose and treat eye diseases and other vision-related conditions.  I hope to be working in a practice that allows me to make a difference in people's lives on a daily basis.
Well, if I were given the opportunity to be a part of Edoofa's program, I believe it would be a great way to achieve my dreams of becoming an optometrist.  The program would provide me with the necessary knowledge and skills to become a successful optometrist, and would also give me access to the resources and support I need to succeed.  I also believe that the program's focus on technology and innovation would give me a competitive edge in the field of optometry.  Overall, I believe that Edoofa's program would be a great fit for me and would enable me to achieve my dreams of becoming
08/12/23, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Seline, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
08/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Yes
08/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 706 9620: I want to study abroad because I believe it will provide me with an opportunity to learn about other cultures, experience different perspectives, and broaden my horizons.  I also think it will give me a chance to develop skills that I can use in my future career, such as cross-cultural communication and global awareness.  Additionally, I believe that studying abroad will challenge me in new ways and help me grow as a person.  I'm excited about the opportunity to learn and grow in a different environment.
Yes, you could also mention something about the advantages of studying optometry in a different country.  Studying optometry in a different country will give me the opportunity to learn from different optometrists and gain exposure to different technologies and techniques.  This will help me become a more well-rounded optometrist and give me a competitive edge in the field.  Additionally, I'll be able to bring back the knowledge and skills I learn to my home country, which will benefit both me and my community.
08/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
08/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 706 9620: If given the opportunity to study abroad, I would be honored to take what I learn and apply it to my own country's education system.  I want to help improve the quality of education in my country by bringing back new ideas and approaches that I learn while studying abroad.  I believe that by doing so, I can make a positive impact on the lives of future generations of students in my country.
08/12/23, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Seline, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
08/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 706 9620: I believe that the environment in which we study plays a crucial role in shaping our success and ability to have a positive impact on the world around us.  A supportive and encouraging environment is necessary to foster creativity, innovation, and drive.  It's not enough to simply have access to education - it must be accompanied by an environment that allows students to flourish and reach their full potential.  I think that the two go hand-in-hand, and without both, it would be difficult to achieve true success.Yes I agree which is why I would be honoured to be part of your program which provides necessary knowledge and skills to become a successful optometrist and I believe that'll be a conducive environment for me
08/12/23, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
08/12/23, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
08/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Yes
08/12/23, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
08/12/23, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

08/12/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: So now Seline, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

08/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Are there any challenges facing the education system in India
08/12/23, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships because the education system in India is modern with students gaining practical knowledge more rather than theoretical one, also English is the medium of education in India so there are no language barriers for students to learn.
08/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Ok I have no more questions
08/12/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.
08/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Yes I have
08/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
08/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 706 9620: No
08/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
08/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Ok noted
08/12/23, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Seline what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 706 9620: So the scholarship is not a 100% scholarship?
08/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: .
08/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Ok noted
08/12/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
08/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Yes please
08/12/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Seline, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

08/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

08/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
08/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

08/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
08/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
08/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Yes I think it will benefit me and I think the earn while you learn program is good since it helps one to have experience before starting his professional journey
08/12/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Seline, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Ok this is interesting
08/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 706 9620: So should you do something to be given a live online project or it's given to every student in the Edoofa scholarship program
08/12/23, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.

09/12/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: Yes Seline, every student is given an opportunity to take part in the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits, Students who are enthusiastic enough to earn more credits do ask for more projects to lighten the financial burden on their parents.
09/12/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

09/12/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
09/12/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
09/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 706 9620: So this earn while you learn program is it also applicable during the holidays
09/12/23, 11:39 am - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct, the opportunity to earn credits through EWYL starts just after you enroll with the Edoofa Program.
09/12/23, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: Alright Seline, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
09/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 706 9620: Yes they will
09/12/23, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
09/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 706 9620: Not yet
09/12/23, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
09/12/23, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
09/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Yes
09/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Seline as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
09/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 706 9620: $1500 to $2250
09/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Seline, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
09/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Mr Gurvinder I would have loved to get this scholarship but the $350 is still a big amount for my parents
It's actually the fees for a semester here in Zimbabwe
09/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Just continue with the session, I will address this issue too.
09/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Ok sir
09/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
09/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Yes
09/12/23, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
09/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Seline basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
09/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Ok sir
09/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
09/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Noted
09/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 706 9620: No I'm not
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
09/12/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Seline, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
09/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Noted
09/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
09/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
09/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
09/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 706 9620: Can you explain in simpler terms about paying the remaining annual fees. I didn't quite understand
09/12/23, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: The registration fee is a part of your annual fee that is paid to confirm your scholarship Seat in the university, then the balance amount from the annual fee is paid in installments.
09/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 706 9620: So the balance is paid in installments till 2025 right
Will it be the same for the following years
09/12/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
09/12/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
09/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
09/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

09/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that on Monday at 12 pm, I will also be connecting with you and your family in this group, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
14/12/23, 8:06 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
