You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
14/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 738 2112: Okay sir ..... No lm miss khumalo
14/12/23, 11:00 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Sheron, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Sizalobuhle, is that correct?
14/12/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 738 2112: Yes it is
14/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Sizalobuhle, also do tell me whether you learnt about Sizalobuhle’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
14/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 738 2112: Yh she taught me : she said it is a scholarship which is based in India , it helps students to fulfill their dreams ,it recruits students who finished their senior level and got five points and above and she also said she was helped by this scholarship to fulfill her dream in short thats all
14/12/23, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
14/12/23, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14/12/23, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
14/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
14/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 738 2112: Noted
14/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 738 2112: Yes it is
14/12/23, 7:51 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
14/12/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 738 2112: Okay l understand sir ...... I have got a problem of charging my cell phone but l will make sure l get online by this time you mentioned
