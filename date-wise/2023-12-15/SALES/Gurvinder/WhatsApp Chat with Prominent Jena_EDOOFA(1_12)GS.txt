01/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Prominent, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Persistance, is that correct?
01/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes she told me
01/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Persistance, also do tell me whether you learnt about Persistance’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 007 2313: All l know is that Edoofa is a scholarship program
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Also it solve affordability and employability at higher educational level
01/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Edoofa want to provide education for all not for the few privileged
01/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Sister Persistance told me that Edoofa is trying to solve the problems of parents who are not affording to let their children to school through providing scholarship
01/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
01/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
01/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
01/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
01/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
01/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 007 2313: That's true
01/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Noted

01/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Prominent, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
01/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 007 2313: I'm looking for a financial help to pursue my studies and caring my parents
01/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
01/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
01/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Ok l get you write

04/12/23, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
04/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 78 007 2313: That's true

04/12/23, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
04/12/23, 11:34 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

04/12/23, 11:41 am - Gurvinder: So now Prominent, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
04/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 007 2313: So if l get a scholarship are there any visas and passport you prepare for me
04/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 007 2313: Do you provide me with everything
04/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 007 2313: So what shows me that l pass the counseling session
04/12/23, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Prominent, our experts will guide you through every step of the VISA application process.
04/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 007 2313: So when do you tell me that l pass the counseling
04/12/23, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: You will be told by me only.
04/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 007 2313: Ok sir l get you right
04/12/23, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
04/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 007 2313: Ok sir
04/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 007 2313: No they are not familiar that why you are there Edoofa to provide education for all
04/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
04/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Noted
04/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Prominent what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Ok sir
04/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
04/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes
04/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Prominent, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
04/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Noted
04/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
04/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

04/12/23, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
04/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes
04/12/23, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Prominent, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

04/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
04/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes sir
04/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 007 2313: How long does it take to finish this counseling session sir

04/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
04/12/23, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes there is a difference
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes sir
04/12/23, 7:14 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
04/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Thanks sir
05/12/23, 8:17 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Ok sir
05/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Sorry for late response it was a network problem
05/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Prominent, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
05/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Ok sir
05/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Ok sir l understood very well
05/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Now I got a wider view and adequate knowledge on Edoofa scholarship program
05/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 007 2313: It's my wishes to be selected and l believe that God will make it possible
05/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 007 2313: I pray and have a faith on what l'm doing
05/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: I believe in your faith.
05/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
05/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes sir Gurvinder
05/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes l have discussed
05/12/23, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes
05/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 007 2313: I'm ready for it
05/12/23, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Prominent as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 007 2313: end up spending $1 500
05/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Noted
05/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Prominent, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes that's true sir
05/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Ok sir
05/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Noted
05/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes l think so
05/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Yes
05/12/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Prominent, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
05/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 007 2313: I refer to it very well
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Noted
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
05/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 007 2313: I got you right sir
05/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 007 2313: Now are we going to step 2
05/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
05/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
05/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

13/12/23, 7:44 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
