*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same! <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 7:32 am - +260 767690386: Hey am Luyando siavwapa
05/12/23, 7:43 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Luyando,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/12/23, 7:44 am - +260 767690386: Thank you sir
05/12/23, 7:51 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
05/12/23, 8:06 am - +260 767690386: These are  Indian scholarships that are given to Zambian students who just completed their grade 12 so that they can further their studies in india
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, but let me also brief you about the program.
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
05/12/23, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
05/12/23, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
05/12/23, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 9:43 am - +260 767690386: Yes sir I really want to do that
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Luyando, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 2:21 pm - +260 767690386: Yes I do have
05/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Now Luyando, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
05/12/23, 5:13 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - +260 767690386: This message was deleted
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - +260 767690386: Yes sir am very willing to work very hard and get to the goals I set for myself
11/12/23, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
11/12/23, 2:58 pm - +260 767690386: Studying abroad offers a unique set of advantages that align with my educational and career goals. Firstly, international universities often provide cutting-edge research facilities and a diverse academic environment, fostering a global perspective. Exposure to different teaching methodologies and interactions with a culturally diverse student body can enrich my learning experience.

Furthermore, studying abroad opens doors to a broader network of professionals and researchers, enabling me to establish valuable connections in the international scientific community. This networking potential is crucial for staying abreast of the latest developments in biochemistry and gaining insights into global research trends.

Additionally, some countries are renowned for their specialized programs and expertise in certain branches of biochemistry. By studying in such a location, I can benefit from curriculum depth and faculty specialization that might not be as readily available in my home country.

Ultimately, the decision to study abroad is driven by a desire to access world-class education, engage in diverse scientific environments, and build a global network that will enhance my career prospects and contribute to my long-term professional success.
11/12/23, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
11/12/23, 3:03 pm - +260 767690386: if granted the opportunity to pursue higher education abroad through this scholarship, my intent is to leverage the knowledge and experiences gained to contribute significantly to the development of the education system in my country. Upon my return, I plan to engage in initiatives aimed at bridging the gap between international standards and local educational practices.

I aspire to introduce innovative teaching methodologies and modern curriculum designs that align with global advancements in biochemistry. Collaborating with educational institutions, I intend to establish mentorship programs, emphasizing practical applications of theoretical concepts to better prepare students for real-world challenges.

Furthermore, I aim to contribute to research collaborations between international and local institutions, facilitating knowledge exchange and fostering a culture of continuous learning. By integrating global best practices, I hope to elevate the quality of education in biochemistry, ultimately nurturing a generation of skilled professionals capable of contributing meaningfully to scientific progress within our country.

In essence, my goal is not only to absorb the best practices abroad but to bring them back home, ensuring that the educational landscape in my country evolves to meet international standards and prepares students for success on a global scale.
11/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Luyando, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
11/12/23, 3:08 pm - +260 767690386: Yes I agree
11/12/23, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - +260 767690386: Yes
11/12/23, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

11/12/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: So now Luyando, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
11/12/23, 3:44 pm - +260 767690386: So when teaching your students what challenges do you face?
11/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: The main points that I focus on are:
Student engagement
Meeting diverse learning needs
Assessing student progress and adapting teaching strategies accordingly <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 3:52 pm - +260 767690386: Alright ...so have you had any challenges so far?
11/12/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: Luyando, don't you worry about that, let us continue the session.
11/12/23, 3:54 pm - +260 767690386: Alright
11/12/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
11/12/23, 3:57 pm - +260 767690386: As for me am not familiar .
11/12/23, 6:09 pm - +260 96 4065340: No sir, please enlighten us.
12/12/23, 7:19 am - +260 767690386: Good morning sir
12/12/23, 8:18 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/12/23, 8:18 am - +260 767690386: How are you?
12/12/23, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
12/12/23, 9:15 am - +260 767690386: Am fine.
12/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
12/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
12/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/12/23, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 10:06 am - +260 767690386: That's nice
12/12/23, 10:39 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Luyando what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/12/23, 10:51 am - +260 767690386: Noted
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - +260 767690386: Yes
12/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Luyando, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
12/12/23, 12:36 pm - +260 767690386: Ok it's so interesting
12/12/23, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/12/23, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
12/12/23, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
12/12/23, 1:31 pm - +260 767690386: Yes it will benefit me
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Luyando, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - +260 767690386: That's very nice and kind
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/12/23, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
12/12/23, 2:22 pm - +260 767690386: This is so amazing
12/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Luyando, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
12/12/23, 5:44 pm - +260 767690386: Yes
12/12/23, 6:17 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
13/12/23, 7:41 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/12/23, 7:41 am - +260 767690386: How are you ??
13/12/23, 8:05 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
13/12/23, 8:16 am - +260 767690386: Am good.
13/12/23, 8:28 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
13/12/23, 8:30 am - +260 767690386: No I have not done that yet
13/12/23, 8:53 am - Gurvinder: Please I hope you will discuss with them after this session.
13/12/23, 8:53 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
13/12/23, 8:54 am - +260 767690386: Yes sir
13/12/23, 8:55 am - Gurvinder: Luyando as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
13/12/23, 8:58 am - +260 767690386: The student would spend aalot
13/12/23, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: Please answer the exact figure.
13/12/23, 9:35 am - +260 767690386: It will be $2250
13/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Luyando, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
13/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 9:37 am - +260 767690386: That's interesting
13/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
13/12/23, 9:51 am - +260 767690386: Yes
13/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
13/12/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
13/12/23, 9:59 am - +260 767690386: Noted
13/12/23, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
13/12/23, 10:01 am - +260 767690386: Am not familiar
13/12/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: Alright Luyando, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
13/12/23, 10:06 am - +260 767690386: I have now understood
13/12/23, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
13/12/23, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
13/12/23, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
13/12/23, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
13/12/23, 10:09 am - +260 767690386: No sir am clear
13/12/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
13/12/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
13/12/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
