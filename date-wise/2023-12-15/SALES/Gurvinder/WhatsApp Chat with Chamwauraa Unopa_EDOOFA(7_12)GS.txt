07/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Please ask Albright to address this.
07/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 964 2419: Yes , correct
07/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Audrey, also do tell me whether you learnt about Audrey’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
07/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 964 2419: Audrey had not yet told me her jorney and experience with the Edoofa program
07/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
07/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
07/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
07/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
07/12/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 964 2419: Yes that true ,l want to be a vibrant  young lady and reduce the financial burden
07/12/23, 8:02 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
08/12/23, 7:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.

08/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 964 2419: Good morning everyone
08/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Albright, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 964 2419: I do have what it takes
08/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now Albright, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

13/12/23, 8:46 am - +27 65 301 0118: Good morning Sir
13/12/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Is Albright online?
13/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 77 964 2419: Good morning everyone, l am online
13/12/23, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: Albright, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
 
But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parents proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like


1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy
2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy
3. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology
4. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics
5. Bachelor of Science in BioChemistry
6. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 6:59 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
14/12/23, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

14/12/23, 10:12 am - +27 65 301 0118: Good morning .
14/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: So do you want to go ahead with any of these given course?
14/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 964 2419: Morning Sir
14/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 964 2419: I would opt for number 4 bachelor of science in medical lab technology
14/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 964 2419: Network is a bit hectic due the bad weather prevailing this side
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
14/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
14/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
14/12/23, 1:12 pm - +27 65 301 0118: Yes sir .
14/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 964 2419: Yes, I do
