Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
14/12/23, 3:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
14/12/23, 3:55 pm - +260 97 4813102: Am minister of religion in the biggest Protestant Church in Zambia. The united Church of Zambia. I have a diploma in theology as my highest education.
What motivates me to support my child to study abroad are,
1, Many girls turn to loose focus easy when studying within. Some end up in early marriages or being pregnant . Those who study abroad do concentrate very much.
2. Being our first born child, am ready to support her to get good education by all means.
3. Personally coming from a humble(poor family) background, my prayer is to see my daughter get the best . 
4. Studying abroad will expose her greatly to the world , in turn she will have confidence to stand on her own without depending on us parents.
5. To get better education than me which will make me happy .
14/12/23, 4:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mr Mukuka*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
