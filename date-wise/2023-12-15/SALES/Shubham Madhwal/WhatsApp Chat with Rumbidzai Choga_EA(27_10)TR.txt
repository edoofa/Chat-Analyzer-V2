However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
30/10/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I'm willing to do so
30/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I know it requires a haedwork
30/10/23, 12:28 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
30/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I'm really intrested to study abroad all because i want to advance my level of Education and also get more knowledge  from the career that i have chosen,  also to study abroad help in terms of getting job easy than hear in our country

30/10/23, 12:43 pm - Tushti: I see
30/10/23, 12:43 pm - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
30/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 867 1027: As i went to research about lndia i have researched about the scholaships that are being offerd from differnt countries and i found edoofa as the best that could help me achieve my goals through research from face book and instagram many students from Africa compliments about the Edoofa
30/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I think Edoofa would be the best to help me achieve my dream ,  i have always wished to study abraod and choose Edoofa as the best
30/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yeah i have understood more about India and also to compliment Indian graduates
30/10/23, 1:41 pm - Tushti: I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
30/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 867 1027: As i said that glad about the compliments that were being given by the Edoofians frm Africa
30/10/23, 1:44 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
30/10/23, 1:44 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/10/23, 1:44 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/10/23, 1:44 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 1:45 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/10/23, 1:45 pm - Tushti: In simple words Rumbidzai, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Ok i
30/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I understand so when starting its 8000 ryt
30/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Per year
30/10/23, 1:53 pm - Tushti: Dear, the fees would be around $3000 per year
30/10/23, 1:53 pm - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
30/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes
30/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Ok thus great
30/10/23, 1:55 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
30/10/23, 1:55 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/10/23, 1:55 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/10/23, 1:57 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 1:57 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
30/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yeah this is clear and straight forward
30/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 867 1027: This is really what  i have been looking for regarding my education
30/10/23, 2:16 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
30/10/23, 2:16 pm - Tushti: Rumbidzai, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Ok so the student can end up spending $1500 -$2250  for appliyieng  in 5 universities
30/10/23, 2:30 pm - Tushti: Exactly Rumbidzai, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/10/23, 2:30 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 2:30 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
30/10/23, 2:30 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Well understood
30/10/23, 2:40 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Then from this its starting from round 3 ryt
30/10/23, 2:41 pm - Tushti: Yes
30/10/23, 2:41 pm - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
30/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Ok
30/10/23, 2:41 pm - Tushti: However Rumbidzai, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Ok
30/10/23, 2:51 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
30/10/23, 2:52 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 2:52 pm - Tushti: Alright Rumbidzai, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
30/10/23, 2:52 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
30/10/23, 2:52 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
30/10/23, 2:52 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
30/10/23, 2:52 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
30/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 867 1027: So after recieving an acceptance form we can pay  $200 within 7 days and the other $150 within next 30 days
30/10/23, 2:53 pm - Tushti: Yes
30/10/23, 3:02 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
30/10/23, 3:02 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
30/10/23, 3:02 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

Life in Rwanda 16 Years After the Genocide

Sixteen years have passed since the Rwandan genocide, a brutal episode in history that shook the world's conscience. During those horrific 100 days in 1994, an estimated 800,000 people were brutally murdered in ethnic violence, primarily between the Hutu and Tutsi populations. Today, Rwanda has come a long way in the process of healing, reconciliation, and rebuilding.

In the years following the genocide, Rwanda has witnessed remarkable progress and transformation. The nation's recovery is a testament to the resilience and determination of its people. Under the leadership of President Paul Kagame, Rwanda has experienced significant political stability and economic growth. The nation has implemented various reforms to rebuild and reform the country's institutions, while ensuring justice for the victims of the genocide. Despite its dark past, Rwanda has emerged as a beacon of hope and an example of what a nation can achieve when it is determined to rise from the ashes.

One of the most noticeable changes in Rwanda is its infrastructure development. The government has invested heavily in building roads, schools, hospitals, and other essential infrastructure. The capital city, Kigali, is now a clean and well-organized city, with modern buildings and efficient public services. The improvement in infrastructure has not only enhanced the quality of life for Rwandans but also made the country more attractive to foreign investors and tourists.

Education and healthcare have also seen significant improvements in the post-genocide Rwanda. The government has prioritized education by increasing access to schools and promoting quality education. It has made significant investments in healthcare, leading to better healthcare services, reduced child mortality, and increased life expectancy. The implementation of community health insurance programs has ensured that more Rwandans have access to affordable healthcare, a crucial step in improving overall well-being.

Reconciliation and unity are at the heart of Rwanda's post-genocide recovery. The government has introduced various initiatives to promote reconciliation and healing, including the Gacaca courts, where community members came together to address grievances and seek justice. These efforts have played a crucial role in mending the social fabric of the nation. Rwandans have worked tirelessly to foster unity and ensure that the ethnic divisions that fueled the genocide are a thing of the past.

The economy of Rwanda has shown remarkable growth over the years, with a focus on diversification. Agriculture remains the backbone of the economy, employing a significant portion of the population. Additionally, the government has actively promoted sectors such as tourism, information technology, and financial services. Rwanda has become a hub for technology and innovation in Africa, earning the nickname "Silicon Valley of Africa." The nation's ease of doing business, low corruption levels, and a business-friendly environment have attracted foreign investment and entrepreneurs.

While the progress is undeniable, challenges still remain. Rwanda's political landscape has been criticized for its lack of political pluralism and freedom of speech. The government's strict control has raised concerns about political dissent and human rights. Critics argue that the emphasis on unity and reconciliation has sometimes been used to stifle opposition voices.

Moreover, the scars of the genocide still linger in the memories of many Rwandans. Survivors continue to grapple with trauma, and the society as a whole is dealing with the painful legacy of the past. The process of reconciliation is ongoing, and it will take time for all wounds to heal completely.

In conclusion, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide is a story of remarkable recovery and transformation. The nation has made significant progress in areas like infrastructure, education, healthcare, and economic growth. The resilience and determination of the Rwandan people are awe-inspiring. Despite the challenges that persist, Rwanda stands as a shining example of what can be achieved when a nation is committed to healing, reconciliation, and rebuilding. The progress made in Rwanda serves as a testament to the human spirit's capacity to overcome even the darkest chapters of history and build a brighter future.

PERSONALITY TEST
"My Inspirational Story

Title: My Inspirational Journey

Life is a journey filled with challenges, setbacks, and moments of triumph. My own journey has been a testament to the power of resilience, determination, and the unwavering pursuit of personal growth and success. Through the ups and downs, I've learned valuable lessons and developed traits that define my character.

My story begins with a humble background. I grew up in a small town, where opportunities were limited, and dreams often seemed out of reach. Despite the challenges, I was raised in an environment that nurtured strong values like hard work, perseverance, and integrity. These values would later become the foundation of my character.

One of the most significant challenges I faced early in life was financial hardship. My family struggled to make ends meet, and the uncertainty of our situation was a constant source of stress. However, this adversity taught me the value of resourcefulness and creativity. I became adept at finding innovative solutions to everyday problems and making the most out of limited resources. This experience instilled in me a sense of resilience that I carry with me to this day.

Education was the beacon of hope in my life. I realized that knowledge was the key to unlocking opportunities and achieving my dreams. With unwavering determination, I pursued my education relentlessly. I studied tirelessly, often sacrificing leisure time to excel academically. This dedication paid off when I received a scholarship that allowed me to continue my studies at a prestigious institution.

During my academic journey, I encountered numerous obstacles, but I refused to be deterred. I learned that setbacks are not failures but rather opportunities for growth. With each challenge, I developed problem-solving skills and a deep sense of determination. I came to believe that no goal is too ambitious and that with the right mindset and effort, anything is achievable.

My journey has not been limited to academics; it has also been marked by a commitment to giving back to my community. I volunteered at local organizations, providing support to those facing adversity similar to my own. This experience taught me the importance of empathy, compassion, and the profound impact that a helping hand can have on someone's life.

As I pursued my education and gave back to the community, I also nurtured a passion for entrepreneurship. I started a small business, facing the challenges of entrepreneurship head-on. This endeavor exposed me to the complexities of managing a business, dealing with uncertainties, and embracing innovation. The world of entrepreneurship has taught me valuable lessons about adaptability and taking calculated risks.

Throughout my journey, the traits that define my character have become evident. Perseverance has been my constant companion, allowing me to push through difficulties and emerge stronger. Resilience has given me the ability to bounce back from setbacks with unwavering determination. Creativity and resourcefulness have enabled me to find solutions to complex problems, while empathy and compassion have shaped my approach to giving back to my community. Ambition and a belief in the limitless potential of individuals have driven me to achieve my dreams.

In conclusion, my inspirational journey has been a testament to the power of determination, resilience, and a commitment to personal growth. It is the sum of my experiences, challenges, and triumphs that has shaped my character. I believe that life's obstacles are opportunities for growth and that with the right mindset and values, we can achieve our dreams and inspire others to do the same. My story is a reflection of who I am—a person driven by a deep desire to make a positive impact on the world and to never stop growing and learning.

09/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 206 8628: Yes
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned din Rumbidzai's acceptance letter?
09/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 206 8628: 14 November
09/11/23, 2:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes pelase,  and are you aware  of the transaction methods as well?
09/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 206 8628: Yes
09/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
09/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 206 8628: 2
09/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
09/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi
