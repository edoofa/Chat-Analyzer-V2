Keeping in mind, the industrial requirements and to help them attain the skills I mentioned, the EWYL team has designed 3 projects for them which remain the same throughout their journey, and based on one dedication and performance, the students are assigned more projects. 

Once the students start with the EWYL Program, they would be allotted an EWYL Mentor who will guide them better. An EWYL Mentor's core responsibility is to guide his/her students on the projects allocated to them, ensure they are working hard and earning credits, and at the same time focus on the skills they will need in the industry.

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
13/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 428 3726: Good evening sir
13/12/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 428 3726: write to tell you about myself is that I am nothing but just a unique kind of ‘substance’ made up of hydrogen, carbon, , and oxygen, trying to leave a positive mark in the world. In the effort to do so, I have been continuously changing qualitatively. Being the first   child raised by my parents , I have had quite a rough childhood. Giving up on my aspirations and wishes was a normal part of my life. Living with limited luxuries  has a massive role in my personality today. I know how it is like not to have someone to hear you out when you come back home after a terrible day at school. Hence, I always try to be an ear to my friends and make them feel better.

However, I never let my financial constraints and not-so-easy family life get in the way of my academic goals. On the contrary, I have always been keen to learn new things and achieve good grades. As a result, I successfully managed to go to Alevel  . Getting into grade 12  was one of my  dreams as well as a major goal. Besides, it gave me a chance to make my parents proud and also be the highest level of my Education

2 If i would  get a chance to continue with my academics it would be a dream to study law ,

3 my mother is not employed and my father is a builder

4my father 's highest educational level is grade 11 or elevel  and my mother finished her academics at grade 7

5. my father has been trying to pay for my school fees since i was in grade 1

6 as a dream to continue with my higher education ,i dont who is going to.pay my higher educational level

7 yes i have a sibling  ,whom i called a brother and he  just finished his education and not yet employed

8 i do  my grade 12  at budiriro b college and it is located in gweru midlands and the amount i payed per term is $120 usd
14/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 71 428 3726: Good morning sir
14/12/23, 10:05 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Abishai, 

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
14/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 428 3726: Yes sir
14/12/23, 10:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please why were you not active for your session yesterday Abishai?

14/12/23, 10:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to the question Abishai, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to Law, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
14/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 428 3726: I am a child of working poor immigrants. I saw and lived the many ways that those living hand to mouth are marginalized, shamed, and rendered invisible. As I grew older, I came to understand that knowledge is power and education the great equalizer. I chose law school in part to vindicate my father’s unrealized dreams for himself, and in part to develop the skills that would allow me to speak truth to power, champion the underdog, and narrow the immense gap between what is and what ought to be.
Lawyers are justice’s emissaries. We can achieve success in accord with traditional metrics. What is more, by making people’s lives a little easier, we can achieve significance, creating legacies that transcend our own lifetimes.
I will be grateful to have earned the law degree. I will be thankfull  every day that I could   serve the aims of social justice. I could do  that work as much for my sake as for the sake of the people who are counting on my expertise to make their burdens lighter.

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
