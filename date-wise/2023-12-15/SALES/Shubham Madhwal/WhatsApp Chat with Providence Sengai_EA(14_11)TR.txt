16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Tushti: *Bachelor of Arts in Political Science* is a 3-year undergraduate program in Arts and Social Science

BA Political Science degree holders, usually, find employment in a variety of sector like Public Service, Media, Education, Social Service, Publishing, Politics etc.
Politics has been one of the sustaining features of governance across civilization. A Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science, apart from dealing with Political theories, also teaches about various systems of governance, economics, sociology, international relations, global politics, psychology etc.

The course gives an idea about how a nation runs and teaches how to interpret and analyze political systems. This course is ideal for students who have an interest in learning the mechanisms of the administrative aspects of a country. The course not just deals with modern political scenarios but also encompasses the history of political development, various political revolutions across the world, thus helping a student learn the Political practices of countries around the world.

After a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science, a student has multiple academic options available in India. A student vying for higher studies can opt for an MA in Political Science which is a Master’s degree in Political Science. A student can also opt for an MA in International Relations.

Other than the traditional MA options, there is the option to pursue studies in Law. Students who wish to study law after graduation in political science have the option of 3 year LLB course which is offered to students after graduation in any stream.

The option to do an MBA is also open for students after BA in Political Science. In MBA too, there are multiple options like MBA in HRM, MBA in Marketing etc.

*Career Prospects*

The students have a lot of BA Political Science job opportunities once they complete this course. Some of the major job profiles are:

*Public Administrator*    
As a Public Administrator, BA Political Science graduates can utilize their knowledge to inform policy decisions and administer those decisions effectively.

*Academician*    
Those who choose to pursue further education can, in turn, become lecturers and professors.

*Archivist*    
A political archivist is responsible for assessing, collecting, processing, organizing, maintaining and preserving important records which possess long term value.

*Correspondent*    
A political correspondent is responsible for relaying important political events primarily for news channels.

*Political Content Writer*    
A Political content writer’s job is to write about various contemporary and historical political issues majorly for online media outlets for news and information.

*Consultant*    
A political consultant is a professional who helps an organization make politically informed choices. Their knowledge about political philosophy comes in handy in such roles.

*Manager*    
BA in Political Science helps to understand the broad administrative system in India, thus making them the right fit for managerial positions.

*Subject Matter Expert*    
Nowadays many IT and knowledge processing companies require subject matter experts for different subjects.

*PR Executive*    
Public Relations is also a good option as exposure to political practices also acquaints one with culture and social systems of a place and hence making them ideal for a role as Public Relations executive.

11/12/23, 2:51 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/12/23, 2:52 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

11/12/23, 2:52 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 2:52 pm - Tushti: In simple wordswhat we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 529 7097: Ooow that's quite helpful
11/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 529 7097: I find it crucial as to how Edoofa reduce fees burdens
11/12/23, 2:59 pm - Tushti: Now, let me tell you about the EWYL Program in depth
11/12/23, 3:00 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
11/12/23, 3:00 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/12/23, 3:00 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/12/23, 3:01 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
11/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 529 7097: That's even more than anticipated
11/12/23, 3:05 pm - Tushti: Are you pleased with the Program?
11/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 529 7097: Yaaaa I am actually appreciative towards it
11/12/23, 3:07 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
11/12/23, 3:07 pm - Tushti: Providence, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 529 7097: 1500
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - Tushti: Exactly Providence, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750. <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/12/23, 3:14 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
11/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 529 7097: It's quite relevant
11/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 529 7097: Network issues
11/12/23, 3:15 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/12/23, 3:15 pm - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
11/12/23, 3:16 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
11/12/23, 3:16 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
11/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 529 7097: Mmm mm mmm mm your services are worthy
11/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 529 7097: I do
11/12/23, 3:23 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
11/12/23, 3:23 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:24 pm - Tushti: Alright Providence, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
11/12/23, 3:24 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/12/23, 3:24 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
11/12/23, 3:24 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/12/23, 3:24 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
11/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 529 7097: So far I am well furnished with information
11/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 529 7097: So how many points are ideal for qualifications
11/12/23, 3:28 pm - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
11/12/23, 3:29 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
11/12/23, 3:29 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
11/12/23, 3:29 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!
