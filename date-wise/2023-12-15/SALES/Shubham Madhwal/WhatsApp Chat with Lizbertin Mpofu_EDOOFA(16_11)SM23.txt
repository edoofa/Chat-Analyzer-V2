Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - +267 71 416 882: Greetings to you Shubham.
Yes Edoofa helps students to secure scholarships and always help them with internship opportunities.
16/11/23, 3:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

20/11/23, 2:33 pm - +267 71 416 882: Okay. At A level, Students are given a choice of 3 subjects combination. She had a choice of Computer Science and she added Maths and Biology to make them 3 subjects. Her teachers at Empandeni assisted her to make the choice. I understand that Physics was a better choice than Biology. I hope you appreciate the fact that they can not do 4 subjects at A level. Regards
20/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @26771416882 if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - +267 71 416 882: Okay. I hope, it's not late, if she gets extra lessons to take on Physics and she drops Biology. 
Let me talk to the Teachers and also Lizbertin inorder for us to align with the requirements.
20/11/23, 2:42 pm - +267 71 416 882: Now Computer Science is her favourite subject, and she seems to like it so much.
Is there no way you can assist her?
20/11/23, 2:53 pm - +267 71 416 882: Are we done for the day or there is some information you may require Sir?
20/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please she is elegible for many courses that can provide her with a career opportunities in the field software engineering
20/11/23, 3:47 pm - +267 71 416 882: Fine. Thank you for that. She can continue with her current combination, is that okay. We will get her more Extra lessons for her to come out with better grades.

Thank you for the informative updates and clarity.
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I brief you about the courses?
20/11/23, 3:55 pm - +267 71 416 882: Yes Sir . It is well.

21/11/23, 12:35 pm - +267 71 416 882: Yes go ahead Sir. Regards
21/11/23, 1:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
21/11/23, 2:12 pm - +267 71 416 882: Noted with thanks. I am quite positive she will manage better points in her final exam papers. 
Thank you for the briefing. It is well appreciated.
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - +267 71 416 882: We will also encourage her to aim higher.
21/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - +267 71 416 882: Okay. Yaaa, l know India is quite good in terms of education.
You may elaborate further.

In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
21/11/23, 4:04 pm - +267 71 416 882: Thank you for the compliment. Yes we always do some research, to various areas around the globe.

22/11/23, 5:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 9:37 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Lizbertin, Mr and Mrs Mpofu @263715127458 @26771416882 @263771639754, How are you?
23/11/23, 9:38 am - +267 71 416 882: Good morning to you Sir. l hope you had a restful night.
23/11/23, 9:38 am - +267 71 416 882: Received with pleasure
23/11/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 163 9754: Good morning
23/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 71 512 7458: Good morning
23/11/23, 10:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
23/11/23, 10:25 am - +267 71 416 882: Yes go ahead Sir
23/11/23, 11:09 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great So as you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
23/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 71 512 7458: Nope
23/11/23, 11:28 am - +267 71 416 882: You may shed light on this Sir.
23/11/23, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
23/11/23, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
23/11/23, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
23/11/23, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 12:13 pm - +267 71 416 882: Well elaborated. Thank you for the information.
23/11/23, 12:14 pm - +267 71 416 882: It's quite amazing, how the fees differ.
23/11/23, 1:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
23/11/23, 1:40 pm - +267 71 416 882: That sounds great. Especially the program of internship, it really helps.
23/11/23, 2:13 pm - +267 71 416 882: So if it's 3000 and the scholarship covers 100 % is there anything which needs payment. Or if the scholarship covers 50 % then the student has to pay for the other 50% in this case 1500. Is that so?
23/11/23, 2:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
23/11/23, 3:10 pm - +267 71 416 882: Well explained. Thank you so much. That is great.
23/11/23, 3:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief  you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 512 7458: Yes
23/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
23/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
23/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/11/23, 10:36 pm - +267 71 416 882: Thank you for the information. It is interesting and an eye opener indeed.
24/11/23, 8:33 am - +267 71 416 882: Good morning. 
The program is student friendly in that while studying they do work on line. Students are then aligning theory and practice. 5

24/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
24/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 512 7458: Yes l have 
Yes it is
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 1:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
24/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 512 7458: Okay
24/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 512 7458: 1.The student is offered counselling 
Which involves getting to know about Edoofa ,the courses they offer and why it helps students all over the world
2.Here the students are given tests to see if they are fit to be in the program 
3.The student is accepted if she passes everything 
4.The student is now enrolled into the program 
5.Then the student get admission into the Edoofa program 
6.The student is given the admission letter and visa and is ready
24/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 512 7458: In short  they are   the stages which one undergoes before being enrolled
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 512 7458: Okay
24/11/23, 4:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
24/11/23, 4:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth. 


2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off


3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.

4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
24/11/23, 4:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
24/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 512 7458: Earn while you learn 
Because the students have access to more practical experience and also having money to cover daily expenses
24/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 512 7458: And also affordability through guaranteed scholarships 
This helps students to have access to education despite struggling to pay fees
24/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
24/11/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 512 7458: No you didn't 
Okay that is wonderful
24/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

29/11/23, 9:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone, 
Please excuse me for being unavailable for the past few days as there was a family emergency.
I am here for us to continue with your session, so shall we start?
29/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 512 7458: Good morning
29/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 71 512 7458: Yes
29/11/23, 10:17 am - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
29/11/23, 11:20 am - +267 71 416 882: Good morning Sir. I hope you managed to sort it out.
29/11/23, 11:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
29/11/23, 11:25 am - +267 71 416 882: Okay. Noted. That is great.
29/11/23, 11:29 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
29/11/23, 11:29 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 11:33 am - +267 71 416 882: Noted thanks.
It's really good initiative.
29/11/23, 11:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
29/11/23, 11:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
29/11/23, 11:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
29/11/23, 11:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
29/11/23, 11:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 512 7458: Yes you did mention it
29/11/23, 11:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.

We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
29/11/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 512 7458: Okay
29/11/23, 11:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great so I have an assignment for you, No need to panic as the answers to every question is resting in this chat itself, so make sure if you don't know the answer find it from the chat and then write it down

29/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 512 7458: 1.Vision and  benefits

• Edoofa is an educational program with a steadfast focus on providing quality higher education that directly leads to promising employment opportunities.  

• Our mission extends beyond employability; we are determined to tackle the issue of affordability that plagues countless students aspiring to pursue higher education. 

• Our vision for every student is to impart them with not just knowledge but also the relevant skills and attitude. 




Edoofa Program Benefits
 *affordability and employability* .

• *Quality international higher education* has become so expensive in recent times that students and their 
parents have to undertake massive debt to get to college. And further, getting to college and 
struggling to pay the high fees isn’t a guarantee of career success 

● *Edoofa Scholarship (50-100% scholarship on Tuition Fee)* with prime focus on 
affordability: No other program offers this level of affordability. With the Edoofa 
scholarship, African students will be paying the lowest possible fees to get such a 
quality education.
 Edoofa also gets the registration fees (the fees that students pay to 
register and confirm their admission) adjusted from the tuition fees, 
thus extending further benefits to them and making their overall expenditure lower 
than any other program.

● *Earn While You Learn Program (SEELS program):* This is a most unique opportunity 
that no other program offers. >Every Edoofa Student gets an opportunity to *learn* and 
 *build valuable job skills* from the very first year of college. All of this happens right 
alongside college education. What is even greater is that; these students can earn up 
to *Rs50-60 thousand (800-1200USD)* per year in the form of scholarship credits by 
 *working in online/part-time internships* (Working full-time on a Student Visa is not 
allowed under current regulations by government in India)
This is a way that Edoofa Students are given an opportunity to self-
finance their education.

● *Expert counselling support and guidance:* Team Edoofa has spent more than a decade working with Indian universities and Colleges and has transformed  the lives of 
thousands of students.
 *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *11th or 12th of December 2023*

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring.

TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?
 Life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has been a period of rebuilding and reconciliation. The country has made significant progress in many areas, including economic development, infrastructure, and education. However, there are still challenges facing the country, such as poverty, disease, and ethnic tensions.
Rwanda's economic development: Since the genocide, Rwanda's economy has grown rapidly. GDP has increased by over 6% annually, and per capita income has more than doubled. The country has also made significant investments in infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and power plants. This has made it easier for businesses to operate and has attracted foreign investment. The Rwandan government has also made significant progress in education and healthcare. The primary school enrollment rate has increased from 64% in 2001 to over 90% today. This has helped to reduce illiteracy rates and increase the number of skilled workers in the country. The government has also built new hospitals and clinics, and made improvements to existing facilities. This has led to a decrease in infant mortality and an increase in life expectancy.
The challenges: Despite the progress that has been made, Rwanda still faces a number of challenges. The country is still one of the poorest in the world, and poverty. Overall, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has been a time of rebuilding and recovery. The country has made significant progress in many areas, including economic development, infrastructure, and education. However, there are still challenges facing the country, including poverty, disease, and ethnic tensions. The future of Rwanda depends on the government's ability to address these challenges and continue to improve the lives of its

PERSONALITY TEST
"My Inspirational Story"

*The examiner will use your composition to analyze your personality traits. USE AT LEAST 400 WORDS.*
My inspirational story is the one of Margaret Hamilton.
Margaret Hamilton was a computer scientist and systems engineer who played a pivotal role in the development of software for the Apollo space program. She was born on August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana, and grew up with a strong interest in mathematics and science. In 1958, she earned a degree in mathematics from Earlham College and later went on to pursue graduate studies in mathematics at the University of Michigan.
In the early 1960s, Hamilton began working as a computer programmer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She was soon recruited to work on the Apollo program, where she was responsible for developing the onboard flight software for the Apollo spacecraft. Her work was crucial to the success of the Apollo missions, including the historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969.
Hamilton's contributions to the Apollo program were groundbreaking in many ways. She was one of the first programmers to use an object-oriented programming language, which allowed her to create software that was more flexible and adaptable than previous programs. She was also responsible for developing software that could detect and correct errors in real-time, which was essential for the safety of the astronauts onboard the spacecraft.
After the Apollo program, Hamilton continued to work at MIT and later founded her own software company, Hamilton Technologies.
