I want to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. *But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough resources and study materials due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting. Therefore, after the evaluations, the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

11/10/23, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: @263775022532 , if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.

13/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 502 2532: Morning
13/10/23, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"The Sun himself is weak when he first rises, and gathers strength and courage as the day gets on."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/10/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 502 2532: Noted
13/10/23, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: May I know if you understood everything properly?
13/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 502 2532: Yes I did
13/10/23, 11:19 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
13/10/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 502 2532: I am very aware and it's manageable  or affordable to people like me
13/10/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
13/10/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/10/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 502 2532: So how much am I expected to pay if by any chance she qualifies to EDOOFA
13/10/23, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
13/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Yes go ahead
13/10/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
13/10/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
13/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 502 2532: So in other words this means the student will be working whilst learning to fund the degree
13/10/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
13/10/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, Ma'am
13/10/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
* How to network like a boss - by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
* How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer - by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
* It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship - by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
* Decoding the science of personal branding - by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
13/10/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit your child?*
13/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 502 2532: This is  great ad definitely benefit my child.
13/10/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
13/10/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

13/10/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your child's international education? <This message was edited>

16/10/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
16/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Good day.
16/10/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please
16/10/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Hei sorry my phone had flat battery but am back online now
16/10/23, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 502 2532: It will be costly between $1500-2250
16/10/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Ok I got it
16/10/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
16/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 502 2532: This is good news indeed
16/10/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/10/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: @263775022532 , basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.* <This message was edited>
16/10/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/10/23, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: @263775022532 I hope we are connected?
16/10/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Well explained and I got it
16/10/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
16/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Yes I did
16/10/23, 6:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 6:41 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
16/10/23, 6:41 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Yes I understand
16/10/23, 8:33 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/10/23, 8:33 pm - Gurvinder: So let me tell you that the next step After you are done interacting with the university you will receive your offer letter( UNIVERSITY ACCEPTANCE LETTER) from the university where your fee and scholarship will be mentioned and the university will give you a few week's time to make the payment of registration fee. Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025).
16/10/23, 8:33 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/10/23, 8:34 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 9:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
16/10/23, 9:26 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/10/23, 9:26 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *Tomorrow at 12 PM CAT* Mr. Shubham would be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *I have also shared the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt.

17/10/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Kunashe and Ms Lydia @263718146495 @263775022532 

I am Mr Shubham, Senior Academician at Edoofa

I have been evaluating your responses in the counselling session with your counsellor.

17/10/23, 1:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I understand in that case  you as her mother  can participate on her behalf, So shall we continue?

17/10/23, 3:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So *@263775022532*, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that *Kunashe* would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

1.  Bachelor of Science in Optometry

2.  India

*In case you do not follow these terms then *Kunashe's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
17/10/23, 4:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *24th or 25 of October 2023* for $200 and the *24th or 25 of November 2023* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *24th or 25 of October 2023*

23/10/23, 7:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Kunashe and Ms Lydia @263718146495 @263775022532, How are you?
23/10/23, 7:55 am - +263 77 502 2532: Good morning.
23/10/23, 8:02 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
23/10/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 502 2532: Yes I am available
23/10/23, 8:54 am - Shubham Madhwal: So I hope you have gone through Kunashe's acceptance letter Ms Lydia?
23/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 502 2532: Yes
23/10/23, 12:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fees payment deadline mentioned in Kunashe's acceptance letter?
23/10/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected?
23/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Good day. Sorry I was tied up. Now am online.
23/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 502 2532: It's 27 October 2023
23/10/23, 3:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: And are you clear with the Transaction methods as well?
23/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Yes it's very clear
23/10/23, 3:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
23/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 502 2532: The second option
23/10/23, 3:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
23/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Noted
23/10/23, 4:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333038009240398

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
23/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Ok
23/10/23, 7:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any other questions you would like to ask?
23/10/23, 8:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
27/10/23, 7:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Kunashe and Ms Lydia @263718146495 @263775022532, How are you?
27/10/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 502 2532: Good morning
27/10/23, 9:03 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
27/10/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 502 2532: Yes
27/10/23, 9:12 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please why have you been inactive for your session Ms Lydia?
27/10/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 502 2532: Am doing a lot of thinking. I have come to realize that even if I manage to pay the enrollment fee which is being required now but my challenge will be of.managing paying her tuition because am not getting enough funds. The other thing is if I fail to make payments when my daughter will be far away what will happen. What if she gets stuck there. Am struggling to get money currently this is the biggest challenge.
27/10/23, 9:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263775022532 as a parent I do understand your fear, you know this is a concern that every parent who considers an international education avenue for their child has atleast once throughout the process.
27/10/23, 10:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: In my career of assisting more than tens of thousands of parents, one thing that I always share with students and their parents is that if the parent is transparently sharing their challenges, there will not be a situation ever throughout the journey of their child where they will not be assisted properly regardless of the challenge that they are facing.
27/10/23, 10:02 am - Shubham Madhwal: You are a single parent and being a single parent is challenging, just think about it where do you feel as a child Kunashe would have the best career opportunities ahead, would it be in Zimbabwe or do you feel it would be in India?
27/10/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 502 2532: India will be the best for my daughter.
27/10/23, 10:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am glad to see that you do believe the same @263775022532. Now as a parent, tell me something.

Do you believe Kunashe as a child is one of those children who have seen your struggle as a single parent and she understands your sacrifices, because of which she is one of the hardest working student throughout her career, or do you feel something opposite of the same?
27/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 502 2532: I feel the same and she also know all the challenges which we are facing.
27/10/23, 12:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263775022532 if you do feel the same, don't you believe that your child would work hard inorder to ensure that she is able to sponsor a major part of her annual fee through her Earn While You Learn Program's projects and assignments?
27/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 502 2532: I think the same but the hindrance is the starting point
27/10/23, 12:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263775022532 if that is the challenge, then why didn't you share it clearly with me please. Do you not feel that I would be able to help you out?
27/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 502 2532: I never thought that way
27/10/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263775022532 I happened to have a word with the Academic Board about your situation and the Board understood your challenges after which unanimously they suggested an alternative fee completion plan for Kunashe such that considering this plan it would be convenient for you to secure her seat and at the same time you would not be financially burdened and displace your focus from completing her school fee which you are working hard towards.
27/10/23, 1:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263775022532 as you know due to the acting policies and standards the Academic Board the Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, they are willing to consider your situation and since Melinda has cleared the required set of eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you are would have to complete a part fee of $100 by today or tomorrow. 

After this you would have time till 20th November to complete the remaining $100 and then the pending amount of $150 is to be paid in the next 30 days which would be around 20th December 2023.  All in all for $350 you will have about 55 days to complete the formalities.

Considering your situation, I believe this financial plan would be convenient to you and your family please?
27/10/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 502 2532: This is very convenient. Thank you

11/12/23, 5:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted please
11/12/23, 5:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ms Lydia I was going through Kunashe's application very closely, And I recalled that you have been facing financial issues for the past few years. And you are putting all your efforts financially so that Kunashe get this scholarship opportunity and have a great career so that later on he can live with his head held high and have a decent paying job, Isn't it
11/12/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Yes thats correct
11/12/23, 6:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that Ms Lydia

See I have reached out to you today, Because I personally feel that Kunashe truly deserve this opportunity and this scholarship can really help you and your family,

So I have been personally speaking about Kunashe's application with admissions team so that she can be provided with a higher quantum of scholarship looking at your financially constraints!
11/12/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Thank you for the effort which you are making
11/12/23, 6:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to tell you that. With Kunashe's current subject combination, she is eligible for *2 such courses that can provide her with a higher quantum of scholarship. I.e. The annual fees would be around $1500-$2300 only*, I would even try that this fee bracket could go further down if possible. Plus after the completion of these courses, Kunashe would receive even better career opportunities and better-paying jobs as well

The courses are *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology* and *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
11/12/23, 6:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I have been counselling students for the past 5 years Ms Lydia and have helped thousands of students, and trust me That opting for these courses will really help Kunashe reach the goals she desires to get.
11/12/23, 6:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected Ms Lydia @263775022532 ?
11/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Yes am connected.
11/12/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 502 2532: The courses which you are talking about are not the one which she needs to pursue.  Actually she wants to be a medical doctor or become an Optician.
11/12/23, 7:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology or Cardiovascular Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.
11/12/23, 7:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.
11/12/23, 7:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in one of these fields is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is
11/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So medical lab technology will technicaly provide her an opportunity to pursue medicine in a better way then Optometry please
11/12/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 502 2532: Ok I hear you. Currently I am talking to her trying to convince her to accept what you are saying
