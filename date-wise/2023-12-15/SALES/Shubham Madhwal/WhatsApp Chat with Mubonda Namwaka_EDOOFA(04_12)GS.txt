04/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
04/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
04/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
04/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

04/12/23, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

05/12/23, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Namwaka, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

06/12/23, 7:51 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve..”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
06/12/23, 8:24 am - +260 97 5766314: Good morning too
06/12/23, 8:39 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
06/12/23, 8:40 am - Gurvinder: Namwaka, how can I offer you a course in agricultural economics, when you do not have economics as a subject in grade 12?
06/12/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 0229181: Good to you too sir
06/12/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir
06/12/23, 9:00 am - +260 97 0229181: Because Economics was not offered at my former school as a subject
06/12/23, 9:14 am - Gurvinder: So that is why I have given you the course that aligns with your interest and passion.
06/12/23, 9:15 am - +260 97 7629841: Good morning everyone
06/12/23, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Mr.Katukula.
06/12/23, 9:23 am - +260 97 0229181: Okay, Thank you sir.
06/12/23, 9:27 am - Gurvinder: So should I brief you about the course?
06/12/23, 9:28 am - +260 97 0229181: Yes please .
06/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: *Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.
06/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.
06/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.
06/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.
06/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.
06/12/23, 9:43 am - +260 97 0229181: Sir, The course is very interesting .
06/12/23, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
06/12/23, 9:47 am - +260 97 0229181: Yes i have understood.
06/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
06/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
06/12/23, 9:52 am - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir, am very confident about achieving it .
06/12/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
06/12/23, 10:23 am - +260 97 0229181: Well sir,  firstly i vision myself for greatness such that my vision perspective widens to bring about positive change in the way some people take small eye defects likely and that me pursuing such a dream can change alot of lives health wise . I picture myself five years after my completion of the course helping alot of lives without any segregation at hand, my vision is also aimed at improving alot of health facilities to people globally and increasing the number of eye health centers in alot of rural and urban areas but more in rural areas because such areas lack adequate and efficient eye clinics or rather centers. Sir , if am found eligible for Edoofa's program it will really add a significant value to my achievements because as you know that Edoofa is aimed at giving scholarships to deserving students so that they can achieve their life long dream and make it a reality . Therefore, Edoofa's program can enable me to achieve this dream and have alot of interactions with areas or rather people that are facing alot of challenges with their eyes  and solving their problems and bringing about positive solutions to cater for everything. Sir, i hope my explanations  have catered for  the questions i have been asked ?
06/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Namwaka, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
06/12/23, 10:30 am - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir , am willing to give my all in this career pathway and  accepting all the opportunities that come my way would be a good achievement starter so that my career is transformed to a great level .
06/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/12/23, 10:50 am - +260 97 0229181: Sir, the reasons to why i want to study abroad is that because i want to improve my knowhow of certain things that are not provided in my country.  As you know that Zambia is one of the improving countries so, some certain facilities that can boost my learning skills are of inadequate supply so studying abroad can be of great help because i can have a chance  to learn new things and new cultures . like for the course i have chosen, my country does not offer more  improved learning skills but i feel i can  access better if i study abroad.
06/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/12/23, 11:11 am - +260 97 7629841: We are following the discussion
06/12/23, 11:15 am - +260 97 0229181: Well sir, if given the opportunity to study abroad and pursue the career pathway i will take it to hand that provision of tutorial services to the students is apprehended and by contributing the knowledge i have received from abroad through doing community sensitisation services to the people so that their knowledge is improved
06/12/23, 11:24 am - +260 97 0229181: Sorry sir but my aim on going abroad is not only for attaining maximum exposure in life but also for the best interest of others such as those in remote nations so that i can be able to help out with  their vision care through the funding of facilities like spectales and vision lenses to improve their eye sight . I also want to lessen on the expenses for my parents since i also have siblings that need the same care as i do .So applying for the program is a good way to start up with helping out on reducing my parents expenses.
06/12/23, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community an for the world Namwaka, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
06/12/23, 12:01 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes i do agree sir.
06/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/12/23, 12:06 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir .
06/12/23, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
06/12/23, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

06/12/23, 12:26 pm - +260 97 0229181: This is very interesting and good. India is really a great nation.
06/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: So now Namwaka, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
06/12/23, 12:37 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir.
06/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/12/23, 12:41 pm - +260 97 0229181: No sir .
06/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 12:51 pm - +260 97 0229181: Edoofa is really a good program sir.
06/12/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Namwaka, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 1:04 pm - +260 97 0229181: Sir, is it that you start the earn while you learn program immediately you are inrolled into the university or maybe you do it after some time ?
06/12/23, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: When you get enrolled with Edoofa, after that you start with earn while you learn program.
06/12/23, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/12/23, 1:41 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir .
06/12/23, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Namwaka, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/12/23, 1:52 pm - +260 97 0229181: Well detailed but sir among the activities stated is community service also a co factor to this program ?
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: No, you do not need to do community service.
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*

06/12/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
06/12/23, 2:10 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes we are sir.
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
06/12/23, 2:30 pm - +260 97 0229181: I feel that the earn while you  learn program is a very significant program to Edoofians such that it contributes alot to their  learning and adhearing of certain skills. Therefore i know and believe that this program will benefit me massively.
06/12/23, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Namwaka, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/12/23, 2:39 pm - +260 97 0229181: In short this program helps with the skillful active and financial stature of the Edoofians ?
06/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
06/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
06/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>

06/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/12/23, 2:45 pm - +260 97 0229181: Well sir, these are  good outcomes of this program.
06/12/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Namwaka, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
06/12/23, 2:49 pm - +260 97 0229181: The program is very interesting  and yes it is something i have been  looking for .
06/12/23, 2:52 pm - +260 97 0229181: Am now clear about the program and am interested to learn more and to be part and parcel of the program.
06/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Namwaka, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir , you're correct.
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes i have but not in depth.
06/12/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 0229181: But since i have learnt alot from this session i will talk to them in depth.
06/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/12/23, 3:05 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes i am sir.
06/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Namwaka as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/12/23, 3:12 pm - +260 97 0229181: A higher amount than expected sir.
06/12/23, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Please answer the exact amount.
06/12/23, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
06/12/23, 3:21 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes we are sir its just that am still approximating
06/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/12/23, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Are you done with the calculation?
06/12/23, 3:32 pm - +260 97 0229181: If its $300 one will spend $1500
If its $450 one will spend $2,250
06/12/23, 3:32 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir
06/12/23, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Namwaka, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/12/23, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - +260 97 0229181: Alright sir.
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/12/23, 3:35 pm - +260 97 0229181: Noted.
06/12/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/12/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/12/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: However Namwaka, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
06/12/23, 3:44 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir  ,i was reading through the paragraphs
06/12/23, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Have you understood?
06/12/23, 3:45 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir , the paragraphs are well explained .
06/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
06/12/23, 3:47 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes  sir but not in depth.
06/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Namwaka, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
06/12/23, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in your country itself.
06/12/23, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir , i have understood the cycle now.
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
06/12/23, 3:59 pm - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir.
how many days does it take for various universities to go through one's application form and send feedback?
Also is it possible for one to change their course when they reach that side if they find it to be difficult?
06/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: The universities might take 1-2 weeks, and the course can only be changed before arriving in University.
06/12/23, 4:04 pm - +260 97 0229181: Okay sir , thank you for the clarity.
06/12/23, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: Have I addressed you doubt?
06/12/23, 4:07 pm - +260 97 0229181: Another question .
since failing is part of learning ,what happens to someone if he/she fails some course subjects once ?
can his/her scholarship be terminated or one will be given another chance to make things right?
06/12/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: If you fail a subject in the University, you will be given a chance to reappear, that will not affect your scholarship.
06/12/23, 4:08 pm - +260 97 0229181: Thank you for the clarity .
06/12/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
06/12/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

" My Inspirational Story"

My name is Namwaka Mubonda , my long life story begins from childhood of which was favourable and one cannot complain.So , my journey began at Njase Girls Secondary school where i learnt alot of things and my moral life was more improved , at first in the beginning of my journey at Njase Girls i faced alot of challenges with adapting to a new place , new learning set up but as time went on 
I learnt to understand alot .Ofcourse friends were part of my journey but some friends are there only in good times while others are there all the time .Well, school was quite an adventure because i learnt alot of practical skills through the field trips that were available at that time , there was a point in life where i felt like nothing was going well so as my grades were put on the line but all thanks to God almighty i was able to overcome that storm and because of that storm i faced in the third term of my grade eleven year i got to understand things in a different way and see people in a different way.Because of that storm i learnt that not everyone who claims to be your friend is actually your friend but i also got to  meet real friends and very helpful when it came to giving advise  . In my twelfth grade i buckled up myself and concentrated on my studies and duties of being a prefect though i spent alot of days and nights studying for the exam that was going to determine my future i still didn't lose focus of what i wanted in life . Being an opthamologist was and has always been my dream to achieve so that i can assist many lives out there and improve many people's way of life at large . Through my senior friends Juliet Mwenda and Francine Chilabi i got to learn about the Edoofa program and knowing this program and taking part in it has really helped me and brightened me for the future out there. So if i was given a chance to advise anyone out there who at some point felt like things were not going well for them , i would say when things look as though  there is no way of things getting well, God always has a way to fix things and can make one's life a living testimony  .Therefore faith,courage ,hardwork ,honesty and determination are one of the keys to succeed in life and overcome many obstacles. <This message was edited>

Title:Life In Rwanda  16  Years After The Genocide

The genocide that took place in Rwanda is still greatly remembered by many residents of Rwanda.
the effects of that genocide led to women suffering the consequences of rape and sexual abuse  .Many children were orphaned and had to survive on their own , Alot of survivors  developed long-term psychological problems .However, overtime Rwanda rebuilt itself and many people played an important role in its development. During the five years of civil war that culminated in the 1994 genocide,GDP declined in three out of five posting a rapid decline at more than fourty percent in 1994.

Residents of Rwanda enjoy a low corruption rate and high quality of life making the country an ideal location for innovative ideas ,research and exploration.

Rwanda has made significant progress in rebuilding and developing since 1994 genocide . However, the small and landlocked country of nearly fourteen million people face many challenges today including inflation and high unemployment rates. Therefore the Rwanda genocide brought about a great impact to Rwanda's history and current upbringing .
