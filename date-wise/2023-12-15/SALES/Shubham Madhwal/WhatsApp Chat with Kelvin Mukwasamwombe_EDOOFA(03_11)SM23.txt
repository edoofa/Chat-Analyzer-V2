Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
03/11/23, 4:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
03/11/23, 4:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

15/11/23, 6:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
16/11/23, 6:36 am - +263 78 363 5181: It is my privilege to write to the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to enable me to partake studies in Electrical and Electronic Engineering ( EEE).I regard it as an honor affiliating with your organization at such a level.

My is Kelvin Mukwasamwombe.I did my A level subjects in the following areas :Additinal(Further) Mathematics ,Physics ,Chemistry and Pure Mathematics at Mutare Boys' High which is located in Manicaland province in Zimbabwe and my A level course last year in 2022.At my former school ,the fee per-term was one hundred and seventy (US) dollar equivalent to the local currency by that time.

I am a boy aged 20years from a low income earning family of four(4) boys whereas i happen to be the first born child .My father is self employed and is the only major bread winner in the family support us all.The money he earns has to cover up all the loop holes in the day to day expenses such as food and even rent and fees for my younger brothers and i to go to the school.Both of my parents only achieved their education  and left school after attaining Ordinary Level( O'level) .

In addition to this ,my siblings are going to school ,so the source of income does not even manage all of us at one time.At times again, my parents would borrow money from close relatives and friends for me to go to school .More so ,they struggled to pay for my A level registration fee until some church members gave them money that parents used tto pay my examination fee on the last day of the registration period
16/11/23, 6:36 am - +263 78 363 5181: Despite all the challenges, i still work hard to aim high and achieve my goal in Electrical and Electronic Engineering .I'm quite very passionate about my work and ambition , and if granted this Scholarship, i will do my best.As a matter of fact, i think i will do my best in the work - study concept in order for me to support my higher education abroad since my background is no financially stable .

In view of the above facts , it remains necessary that you consider funding one my proposed application.

Thanking you in anticipation of a favourable response.

Yours  faithful

Mukwasamwombe Kelvin
16/11/23, 9:36 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Kelvin and Mr Mukwasamwombe @263783635181 @263774033136, How are you?

17/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 363 5181: Briefly explaining my encounter during the time when i was still at Mutare Boys' High,Fortunately it was indeed a great experience.I think the reason that  made me a better person lies in the sense that i grew up at Boys Environment for 6 years where we were groomed to be outcoming future gentlemen .We were trained to be men of punctuality in terms our works and also  to be  men of value not just a man of success especially to be full of intergrity and genuine in all what we do
17/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 363 5181: And i believe that helped a lot to my personal life.In additional this i also lived another life at my former school.I used to be involved in academic seminars where i could present on behalf of my school including Mathematics and Physics competition and what i gained for that experience was to be confidential in everything i do and to run away from stage fright which happen to be most of my fellow collegues weakness which end up giving limitation in life if taken for granted.And lastly before i squeeze the lemon to is last drop ,i happen to gain what i consider as one of the major key to successful , innovative ,valuable and ideate life in the society which the Spirit of Cooperation( Teamwork).At my Former school we used to Discuss together  with my collegues suppose on a challenging concepts in different field areas ,and from that i started to realize that without teamwork with love we go nowhere .
I thinks that what i have to share pertaining my previous experience at High school
