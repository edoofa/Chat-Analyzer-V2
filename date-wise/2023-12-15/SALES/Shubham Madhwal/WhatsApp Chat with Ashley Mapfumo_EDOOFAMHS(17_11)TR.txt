17/11/23, 2:34 pm - Tushti: Alright so Ashley, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination
2. The course you would like to study and why
3. What do your parents do (their profession)
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far
7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad
8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $?
9. Name of your school and the province in which it is located
17/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 320 6433: Hello ,Edoofa scholarship program is based in India
17/11/23, 3:18 pm - Tushti: I am expecting a response, here, can someone from the family provide the details?
17/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 371 5731: My name is Ashley Mapfumo.Im  a girl aged 18.I live in Harare.Im third child out of three.My father passed away ten years ago.Currently I live with my mother who's a vendor and ended her education at Advanced level.I enjoy playing volleyball and badminton as my favourite sports.I am intelligent and sociable.I'm a lower 5 student.I'd love to do Accounting because it has always been my dream.My mother is the one who supports me financially for my education and I believe she's the one who will support me abroad.One of my siblings is unemployed whereas the other one is a housewife.My school is Mufakose 1 high and it is situated in the Harare province.My fees is $80 per term but increases due to school events.
17/11/23, 3:59 pm - Tushti: Thank you for your introduction, dear, I am truly sorry to hear about your father
17/11/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: I believe it must be quite challenging for your mother as a single parent to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Is she facing such a situation
17/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 371 5731: Yes she's struggling and wishes for me to have a 100% scholarship
17/11/23, 4:14 pm - Tushti: Ashley, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
17/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 371 5731: Understood
17/11/23, 4:23 pm - Tushti: So, is your mother financially prepared to support your higher studies abroad?

17/11/23, 4:28 pm - Tushti: In that case, do you wish to withdraw this application?
17/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 371 5731: No
17/11/23, 4:29 pm - Tushti: Well, then, how would the family support your higher education?
17/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 371 5731: She'll find the means to obtain the money
17/11/23, 4:33 pm - Tushti: I would like for her to come online and answer the question
17/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 320 6433: I'm here
17/11/23, 4:46 pm - Tushti: @263773206433 Can you help me understand how the family has planned to manage the finances involved in Ashley's higher education abroad?
17/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 320 6433: I will start a business while Ashley is completing her A level but I would appreciate it if you engage in a course that enables her to study while earning some money as you stated earlier that some can study earn while they learn
17/11/23, 4:56 pm - Tushti: Yes we shall certainly do that

08/12/23, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Ashley

I am Mr Shubham, Senior Academician at Edoofa

I have been evaluating your responses in the counselling session with your counsellor.  I want to share with you that due to an emergency Ms Tushti is on leave.

You must have gone through the counselling session so far along with your family members

So shall we continue with your process?
08/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 371 5731: Halo sir
08/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 371 5731: Yes we can
08/12/23, 2:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
08/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 371 5731: Yes, I'm more than willing
08/12/23, 3:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
08/12/23, 5:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 5:24 am - +263 71 371 5731: Indeed I am confident

09/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 371 5731: Yes

09/12/23, 4:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!
