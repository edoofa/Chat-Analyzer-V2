14/12/23, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Sibanda D
 
I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer* 


We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Adrian*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the application form which you submitted and what I was able to understand from the same!
14/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Okay thank you
14/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 440 8694: I'm now online
14/12/23, 1:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Sibanda, How are you?
14/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 440 8694: I'm good thanks and how are you
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes
14/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Adrian?*
14/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 440 8694: 1) My dream to pursue law. Going to university to do my tertiary education might prove to be a very challenging problem to my parents considering the hiking school fees and the drastically changing Zimbabwean economy. An Edoofa Scholarship is something that might definitely change my life forever since I would be granted an opportunity to pursue my dreams
14/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 440 8694: 2) from the discussion I had with Adrian I figured out that Edoofa is not just a scholarship program that offers and ensures accessible education for all despite nationality and race but it's definitely a life changing program that probably endows students with life changing skills since they even allow a platform whereby a student can learn while working as well. This not only builds a student academically but it also helps them be able to balance things in life given the scenario that they earn while they learn. It also helps them learn to depend on themselves hence destroying the dependency syndrome whereby students have to rely on their parents for everything which I believe is something that builds responsible and better human beings. I therefore believe Edoofa is not just any ordinary scholarship program but it's a life changing and extraordinary program
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*

So are we good to begin your session?
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Ok thank you
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes
14/12/23, 1:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*.

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
14/12/23, 2:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
