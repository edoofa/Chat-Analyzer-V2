Here's my answer for your question 
Being provided with a career option mostly law abroad, I see myself as  successful and highly skilled attorney in five years. I would have established myself as a respected professional within the legal community, and would be providing clients with top-notch legal services. I would have a strong network of professional contacts, and would be well-versed in international law. I would be working to promote and defend the rights of my clients, and would be a champion for justice and equality. I would also be learning new languages, and would be travelling to different countries to gain exposure and experience. Overall, I would be living my dream and making it ,
And with the help of Edoofa 
I can achieve my  dreams by providing financial support for education and training. By receiving a scholarship, l can focus on my  studies without worrying about the financial burden of tuition and other expenses. This can allow me to pursue my  desired career and achieve my  goals.

09/12/23, 11:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
09/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 610 6366: L have realized that by studying abroad l can get to experience new things which may help me to have more creative ideas that once l finish my University abroad  l can apply what l learned to my country and maybe somehow advance it  to another level  ,so learning at a new environment is the best choice for me
09/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 610 6366: And l have also learned that if l proceed my University in my home country,l won't have brand ideas or solutions as l've already adapted to the problems at ground but  if l learn at a new environment ,l might apply what l would be seeing in your country and help mine as well
09/12/23, 12:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
09/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Yes I did
09/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 610 6366: But  most universities wanted students who did science and comecial subjects at Advanced level ,
09/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 610 6366: And l couldn't cope up with their requirements as l did Arts subjects and Also the universities  requires very high grading in law students especially local Universities <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 12:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted Pelase
09/12/23, 12:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
09/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Yes refraining from our last interview you said $2000usd and my parents said they can afford to pay such amount
09/12/23, 12:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.

*But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation


*To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
09/12/23, 12:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Noted
09/12/23, 12:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
09/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 272 2801: Noted thank you
09/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Noted thank you

09/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Yes please
09/12/23, 12:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
09/12/23, 12:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
09/12/23, 12:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

09/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Thank you
09/12/23, 1:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

09/12/23, 1:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
09/12/23, 1:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

09/12/23, 1:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

09/12/23, 4:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

11/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 272 2801: Yes please thank you
11/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
11/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
11/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
11/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
11/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
11/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
11/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
11/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Noted thank you
11/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Thank you for taking the time to show me the process for admission .Your explanation was very helpful and I appreciate your effort.
11/12/23, 12:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:

1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
11/12/23, 12:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
11/12/23, 12:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
11/12/23, 12:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
11/12/23, 12:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
11/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Your affordable scholarship programs as they give an opportunity for students to study abroad despite many not being able to afford it and l appreciate the opportunity you are giving me as it was always my dream to study abroad and get to experience the new environment 
Thank you
11/12/23, 12:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
11/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 610 6366: And stage four whereby you assist your edoofian students until they are well settled
11/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 610 6366: My parents and with the help of your program l think they would be of great assistant
11/12/23, 1:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
11/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Yes you did refraining from our last session you stated if one is serious and passes his /her evaluation

11/12/23, 1:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
11/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Noted thank you
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 610 6366: Noted thank you

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme danger, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the timidest men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death gather resolution from despair but there can really be no trace of so strength a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring.

TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?
The genocide was believed to have been the tragic event that took place in the year Rwanda in the year 1994, resulting in the death of thousands of people and economic meltdown in Rwanda. However, life in Rwanda after after 16 years has seen significant progress in terms of rebuilding and recovery efforts. Despite the tragic event the government has made great strides in economic development and according to unknown scholars Rwanda has become one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. 
a
The government has implemented policies to promote unity and reconciliation among the ethnic groups. The genocide was carried out by a group called the Hutu extremist who sought to eliminate the Tustin population which led to violence for the next 100 days. The Rwanda government has since made efforts to promote unity and reconciliation among the groups and prevent future violence, hence peace was brought back in Rwanda.

Rwanda has made significant progress in economic development in the 16 years after the genocide. The country has implemented policies to promote private sector growth, attract foreign investment, and improve infrastructure. The government has also focused on developing key industries such as agriculture, tourism, and information technology. Rwanda has also made strides in improving access to education and healthcare, which has helped to reduce poverty and improve living standards. Additionally, the country has made efforts to promote regional integration and increase trade with neighboring countries. These developments have helped Rwanda become one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa.

The Rwandan government has implemented various policies to promote unity and reconciliation among different ethnic groups after the genocide. Some of these policies include creating community-based programs that encourage dialogue between different groups, establishing a national unity and reconciliation commission, and promoting education and awareness about the genocide and its impact. Additionally, the government has worked to bring perpetrators of the genocide to justice, which has helped to promote accountability and prevent future violence. These policies have helped to promote healing and build a more peaceful and inclusive society in Rwanda.

Despite the significant progress Rwanda has made in the 16 years after the genocide, poverty remains a challenge for many people in the country. The poverty rate is still high, particularly in rural areas, and many people struggle to access basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare. However, the government has implemented various programs and policies to address poverty, including social protection programs, job creation initiatives, and investments in infrastructure and education. These efforts have helped to reduce poverty levels in the country, but there is still more work to be done.

In conclusion Despite this, the people of Rwanda have shown resilience and determination to move forward and create a better future for themselves and their country, which led to a massive economic development in the country.

PERSONALITY TEST
"My Inspirational Story"
Despite the different obstacles l faced in life, l has learned as an individual that wheneve3r there is a dead end one has to find solution to every situation weather the situation may be tough. I can say that from birth up to where aim, one may greatly conclude that truly aim a l living testimony, as I have learned to overcome my fears by facing them 

To start with one of my greatest obstacles was failure to cope up with the new environment at A level .The whole of my high school life from form one to four ,l was a boarder at a girl's boarding school .However life became difficult when l was did my A level's at a mixed school which was way a lot different as to my old school.At first l failed to cope up with the new environment as there were a lot of new faces ,and l was never good at socialising with other people so l became isolated.However inside l knew that this was wrong so l started volunteering for class presentations, participated more in class and joined school clubs like public speaking , toastmasters , guidance and counciling and by the end of the term l had made a lot of friends.Why lam telling you this,in life one has to stand up and raise himself despite the rough journey inorder to reach your goals , even If it means having sleepiness night thinking of a solution .As for me l knew that no one was going to help me overcome my dear of interaction except myself,and despite the rough journey of a fourty pairs of eyes and ears staring and listening to your presentation ,not concentrating on the topic but only your mistakes,so they could use that to discriminate and embrass you in front of the whole class . But with those comments and questions being thrown at me by students ,just so they could weaken me ,they strengthen and boosted my confidence more as l would have known that what lam saying is right and the rest are wrong 

In conclusion do not let anyone discriminate you or let your fears control your life rather use them to do something productive in your life and at the end of the day you might become the Mastermind of your own game.
