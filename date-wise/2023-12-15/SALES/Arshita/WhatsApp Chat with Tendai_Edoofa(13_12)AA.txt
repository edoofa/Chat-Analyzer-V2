14/12/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 006 4969: I am a boy named Tendai Mapindani. I did my O level at Masvingo Christian school and l proceeded to A level at the same school. I enjoy reading, let it be magazines, let it be newspapers l just love reading. I'm not into sports so l spent most of my time reading. It became an advantage to me because it led me into studying and pass my O level.  Now l'm a L6 student doing sciences (Mathematics, biology and geography) at Masvingo Christian Collage. With this combination l would like to study medicine, There are many reasons why someone might want to study medicine. It's my lifelong dream to become a doctor and help people. I may be drawn to the intellectual challenge of learning about the human body and how it works but l may see medicine as a way to make a difference in the world and improve people's lives, studying medicine can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience. It's not easy, but because l'm passionate about it, it can be incredibly rewarding. I stay with my mother and she is a teacher, she have a diploma in education, my father died in 2018. I have 3 siblings, l'm the first born, the second is now in Form 4, the third is in grade 5 and the fourth is in grade 1. My mom is the who has been supporting us financially for our education and she's the one who will be supporting us. My fee per term is $200 and lastly my school is Masvingo Christian Collage, it is Masvingo province.
