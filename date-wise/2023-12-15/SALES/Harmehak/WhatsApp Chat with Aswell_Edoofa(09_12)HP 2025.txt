Are they willing to support you financially and mentally too?
11/12/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: I am glad they are supportive
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
11/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes im confident
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!

11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile do go through the shared video to learn more about the experience of our Proud Edoofians.

12/12/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.

13/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Thank you for sharing the important information
13/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Ok
13/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome Aswell!

Did you thoroughly read everything?

If so, did you find the information helpful?
13/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes i found it helpful
13/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 691 7416: India is the best
13/12/23, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Aswell.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 691 7416: They are noy aware
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 691 7416: *t
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Thats affordable
13/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.
13/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are your thoughts on the same, Aswell?
13/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 691 7416: I need this opportunity.And thats more affordable
13/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
13/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Aswell, you are student at First Choice Learning Centre, isn't it?
13/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes
13/12/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Great, so are you aware we have students from your school who are currently in India and the ones who are a part of the program as we speak and would be coming to India next year and in 2025?
13/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Not i am not aware . Can you tell me their names
13/12/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, let me request the Academic Board for the list of names.
13/12/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Aswell, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
13/12/23, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: Randy Cleopatra Yule
Shaun MUPonda

These two are currently in India while they are many who are currently in Zimbabwe and would be traveling in August 2024.
13/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Oooh ok
13/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes i agreee its not favorable
13/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Aswell?
13/12/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, however, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
14/12/23, 9:01 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
14/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 691 7416: Yes we can start
14/12/23, 9:29 am - Harmehak: I await your response, Aswell.
14/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 691 7416: I can now better understand how Edoofa is addressing the needs of international students in India. Edoofa is helping to make higher education more affordable by offering scholarships and financial aid, and by providing access to courses that are relevant and practical. By providing students with the right information and resources, Edoofa is making it easier for them to make informed decisions about their education.
14/12/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
14/12/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
14/12/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
14/12/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

14/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 691 7416: Yeah thats good ..In other words you are saying i will be working while pursuing my degree
14/12/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: Yes please
14/12/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 691 7416: Ooh thats a good thing
14/12/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
14/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 691 7416: Lets say i manage to earn scholarship credits worth $200 in a month  ,this means that i can earn $24 000 in a year.So this will cover my tuition and everything right
14/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: You mean $2400 please?
14/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 691 7416: Yh i mean that sorry for the mistake
14/12/23, 9:59 am - Harmehak: I understand please
14/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

14/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 691 7416: Yeah they have done a good job
14/12/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
14/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 691 7416: Yes i am ready
14/12/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Aswell, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
14/12/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
14/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 691 7416: The student will end up spending $1500- $2250
14/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
14/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
14/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: You see, Aswell, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
14/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 691 7416: Ooh thats good news
14/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
14/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
14/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
14/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 691 7416: Yeah true in Africa there is economic instability
14/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 691 7416: Ooh ok
14/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 691 7416: I will have to explain it to my parents
14/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Sure please
14/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Indeed
14/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak changed the group name from "Aswell_Edoofa(09/12)HP" to "Aswell_Edoofa(09/12)HP 2025"
14/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
14/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
14/12/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
14/12/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
14/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 691 7416: Yeah i understood
14/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
14/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 691 7416: Ok is there payments to be mafe during this process
14/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 691 7416: Made
14/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Which process are you referring to please?
14/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

14/12/23, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Dear Aswell,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “15-12-23” at 10:30 P.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed! <This message was edited>
