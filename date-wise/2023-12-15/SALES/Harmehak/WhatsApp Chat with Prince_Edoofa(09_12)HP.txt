11/12/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
11/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Prince, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
11/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 868 7522: That sounds very interesting and also I gotta admit I'm starting to feel secure now and I hope to get a scholarship
11/12/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: We surely look forward to the same
11/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Prince, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Murewa high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
11/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 868 7522: Yh sure 😊
11/12/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Please.

11/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 868 7522: Ooh I'm sorry
11/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I am a boy aged 19  yrs. I love exploring a lot. I love playing football and also watching as well. I had a tough time whilst growing up. My parents divorced when I was very young and I never saw my father. My mom got married again and I'm proud to say she is happy in her new marriage and the husband takes good care of us. At times I just want to see my father and tell him everything that is going on. I lived in the rural area from 4 to 13 years from my grandmother then moved to a boarding school for form 1. From form 1 to form 4 I learned at St Francis of Assisi in Chivhu. After form 4 I moved to murewa high for advanced level. The fees at murewa high was 500 usd
11/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I am the first born. We are only 3 in our family 2 boys and a girl
11/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I love accounts and it's been my dream to be an accountant
11/12/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Prince, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

I am glad you and your mother are now leading a happy life.
11/12/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 868 7522: Thank you sir
11/12/23, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak please
11/12/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I'm sorry mam 
Very sorry 🙏
11/12/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: I understand please.
11/12/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: Well Prince, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
11/12/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 868 7522: Absolutely I believe it can change my life
11/12/23, 8:29 pm - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
11/12/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I'm prepared and we discussed about this with my family and they are willing to support me
11/12/23, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: Prince, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
11/12/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 868 7522: They are willing to support in every way actually. I shared the idea with them and realizing that I also have a plan for myself they were happy
11/12/23, 8:39 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that please.
11/12/23, 8:39 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
11/12/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I am confident of the work and effort i put in those exams and I hope I will make it
11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: That's great
11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Accounting ?
11/12/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 868 7522: At o level i wrote 11 subjects and managed to come up with 10 subjects
11/12/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 868 7522: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 868 7522: They misplaced my English papers so I came out with an x and I rewrote the exams and am waiting for the results as well 
At a level I studied pure mathematics  accounting and computer science
11/12/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: I understand please!
11/12/23, 9:00 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
11/12/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 868 7522: U mean the ones I passed??
11/12/23, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: No please!

So what motivates you to study Accounting ?
11/12/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I always loved accounts
11/12/23, 9:15 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about your desired course,

11/12/23, 9:30 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome.

Alright then Prince, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
11/12/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I wanna build my own name and take accounting to the next level 
I wanna make everyone proud
11/12/23, 9:33 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

How would getting into Edoofa's program assist you?
11/12/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 868 7522: It  would help me with some of the support my parents can't give and I will be glad
11/12/23, 9:44 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Prince, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
11/12/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 868 7522: The education in my country is not that good and I won't be able to achieve my goals in here due to resources and many challenges like politics and many other things so I guess studying abroad may be a better option
11/12/23, 9:47 pm - Harmehak: You see, Prince, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
11/12/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 868 7522: Yh many have degrees but they don't have jobs so I don't want to end up like them
11/12/23, 9:51 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Prince.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
11/12/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I heard that India is a  good country and provides better if not the best education in the world. I wanna become the best so I have to learn at the best institution
11/12/23, 10:02 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you have awareness, Prince.
11/12/23, 10:02 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

11/12/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 868 7522: Yh I'm glad to hear that and I wanna join those people
11/12/23, 10:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, we surely look forward to the same.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
11/12/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I don't know if they can but I'm sure I will be adding a burden on their shoulders
11/12/23, 10:16 pm - Harmehak: I understand please!
11/12/23, 10:17 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/12/23, 10:17 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/12/23, 10:17 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 10:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 868 7522: Ooh that would be great
11/12/23, 10:19 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Prince, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1400-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
11/12/23, 10:21 pm - +263 77 868 7522: I will be glad to try this program the earn while you learn program
11/12/23, 10:23 pm - Harmehak: Surely Prince
11/12/23, 10:23 pm - Harmehak: Prince, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
11/12/23, 10:29 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
