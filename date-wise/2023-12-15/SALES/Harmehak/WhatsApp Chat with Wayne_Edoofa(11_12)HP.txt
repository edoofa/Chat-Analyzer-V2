12/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
12/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 049 6660: Ok that's good to know that your program is in my country and the world at large
12/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Yes please
12/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 049 6660: And also it's great to know that Edoofa make education not just affordable and accessible to students but also make it employability driven so that we become future leaders of our domains
12/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 049 6660: Yes ma'am indeed it is
12/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Very correct, Wayne.
12/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Wayne, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

So what are your plans for higher education? <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 049 6660: I would love to study literature or Art
14/12/23, 9:23 am - Harmehak: That's great,

However would you agree with me that studying abroad would require financial support as well?
14/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 049 6660: I agree
14/12/23, 9:30 am - Harmehak: So may I know more about your financial planning for your higher education in India, Wayne?
14/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 049 6660: Well my teachers from my former school could help me with that that is they could talk to the company that sponsors the school programs programs and helped those in need
14/12/23, 9:37 am - Harmehak: I can understand, Wayne.

Did you happen to discuss with your teacher?
14/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 049 6660: Yes ma'am
My former literature in English teacher said if l asked for help from the sponsor with their help probably we could work something
14/12/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

Do they sponsor students for their education internationally as well?
14/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 049 6660: Well the sponsor only suggests for universities in Zimbabwe and the last time I had from someone who got lucky he said the sponsor only paid for the fees
14/12/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: I understand, Wayne.

So how are you planning for your higher education in India in that case, Wayne?
14/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 049 6660: If l qualify to be an edoofian then I'll have to ask for financial aid if l can't afford the demands for education abroad
14/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 049 6660: But if l don't get and if studying abroad turns out to be expensive then it will be the end of the road for me
14/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: While I understand what you are sharing, Wayne!
14/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Wayne, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
14/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 049 6660: That's right l agree
14/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: So given the costs even in Zimbabwe, how are you planning your higher education please?
14/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 049 6660: The truth is currently l can't afford higher education and no one in my family can
14/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: I can understand, Wayne.
14/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 049 6660: So as a person with a passion for learning have been hoping to get a scholarship to enhance my studies
14/12/23, 11:06 am - Harmehak: Given that costs are lower than those in Zimbabwe, is your family willing to support you financially?
14/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 049 6660: That depends if its affordable to them ma'am
14/12/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: In simple words Wayne, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
14/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 78 049 6660: Oh l get it
14/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
14/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 049 6660: So does one get the 90- 100% scholarship when he or she is already a qualified student?
14/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
14/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 049 6660: I mean does the tution fee reduce when one is already studying
14/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 049 6660: Its seems like the costs you are helping to cover are quite big and helpful to the students
14/12/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: The costs remain same for all the years,

However you can reduce them with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program.
14/12/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Indeed please
14/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 049 6660: Oh l see
14/12/23, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you financially with $1000-$1200?
14/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 049 6660: As for my family no one is capable to raise such money but like I said before I would talk to my former school teachers and together we would see what we could do
14/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 049 6660: I mean asking for a hand from the sponsor of my former school
14/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: I do understand
14/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: You can surely discuss with them and get back to me, Wayne.

Let me share a document with you for an even better clarity.
14/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 049 6660: Ok
14/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the document as well, Wayne.
14/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 049 6660: Sure am working on it
14/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
14/12/23, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
