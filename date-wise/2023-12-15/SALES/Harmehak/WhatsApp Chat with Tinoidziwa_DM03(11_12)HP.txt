12/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tinoidziwa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
12/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 933 5761: Well ma'am l am the first born in a family of five. Over the course of my academic life l have managed to scoop a few achievements one being 9As and 2Bs in my ordinary Level examination. Currently l am further pursuing my Advanced level which l will be completing next year in 2024. Moreso it has been a dream of mine since childhood to pursue Medicine and hopefully become a doctor. 
Well in terms of strength they come in numbers l am a confident young men in general at school l am the captain of the school ashers who see to the proper welcoming of guests and captain to the young writers club who see to the publications of magazines. In addition l am hard working individual as proved by previous results, l am also a persistent and relentless person regardless of any obstacles l face, adding on l have strong work ethics and  determination to succeed which has placed me in the   top 5 best students for the past few years at my school. I also have an unquenchable curiosity and eagerness to learn new things which has kept me at the zenith of my performance. But regardless of these strengths l also have a few weakness of my own which include impatience but recently l have been working on overcoming it and l am a bit indecisive when it comes to making decisions but in the past few years l have learnt to pull through.But overly l am a total perfectionist, I sometimes spend too long agonising over work to get it just right. 

My family is not an elite family but they pull through to every need. My father works in the sales and distribution department in the Mecer company and my mother is a self employed individual who has managed to start her own business. My father has a master's degree in computing and my mother is currently currently working on acquiring a diploma. I also have four  siblings
12/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 933 5761: My major hobby is reading books and research which as been a useful weapon in my arsenal in both quiz and my academic life. I also love playing tennis
12/12/23, 11:39 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tinoidziwa, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to know of your various skills including leadership skills which are greatly required in a student along with your participation in various curricular activities.
12/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 933 5761: Thank you so much ma'am
12/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 933 5761: My objective is to pursue Medicine as previously mentioned and become an *orthopedic surgeon* ( a doctor who focus on caring for your bones, joints, ligaments, nerves, and tendons) and with your help Ms Harmehak l see it being achievable. Thank you
12/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please, Tinoidziwa.
12/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Well Tinoidziwa now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
12/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 933 5761: Yes Ma'am l see it as life changing decision. It's an opportunity to be exposed to diverse learning environment and diverse cultures
12/12/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Very well, and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Tinoidziwa?
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 933 5761: Yes l am
12/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Tinoidziwa, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
12/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 277 2802: Yes  Ma'am  im   fully  aware of  Tinoidziwa's  plans  to  study abroad  and   prepared to  support him in  any  way possible.
12/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: It's great to have you acknowledge the support yourself please.
12/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: So, I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 933 5761: Yes l am jquite confident that l will attain maximum points
12/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 933 5761: Okay ma'am
12/12/23, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
12/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 933 5761: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 933 5761: My current A level combination is 
Mathematics
Biology
Chemistry
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Medicine, Tinoidziwa?
12/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 933 5761: My Motive to study medicine is propelled by, my desire to improve my countries health sector. Truthfully speaking it is my passion and aspiration
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Well that's wonderful, Tinoidziwa,

So did you ever happen to research about your desired field along with its requirements?
12/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 933 5761: Yes l did ma'am
12/12/23, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so what all did you learn regarding the requirements, Tinoidziwa?
12/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 933 5761: It requires exceptional results as it is a competitive program requiring all the maximum points ,"15 points to be precise"
12/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Very correct.
12/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: You see, since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 933 5761: I understand ma'am
12/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 933 5761: So if l am doing math biology and chemistry an l eligible for the program
12/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Physics is a mandatory and strict requirement.
12/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

12/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 933 5761: But at the moment l think l would like to reconsider
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
12/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 933 5761: Well for them time being l will register for bachelor of science in cardiovascular technology since you can't offer me medicine
12/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: I understand
12/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: However can you please elaborate the same?
12/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 933 5761: Well l was disheartened that l couldn't get medicine so l have to reconsider based on the offers you gave me
12/12/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, Tinoidziwa,

However I am glad you are willing to make efforts for a promising future.
12/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 933 5761: Yes Ma'am
12/12/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: What inclined you towards Bachelor of science in Cardiovascular Technology, Tinoidziwa?

13/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 933 5761: I didn't even about most of this
13/12/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Tinoidziwa.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
13/12/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 933 5761: We are not quite familiar with it ma'am
13/12/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/12/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/12/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

13/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 933 5761: That is amazing
13/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 933 5761: And really affordable
13/12/23, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
14/12/23, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
14/12/23, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
14/12/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 933 5761: I am sorry ma'am my data was out so l couldn't view or respond to any of the messages
14/12/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 933 5761: This is basically quite advantageous to the student as it reduces tuition fees and from my perspective l am fully supportive of this advanced learning program
