30/09/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 513 1808: I don’t understand
30/09/23, 10:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me clarify. Since you haven't shared the passport photo yet, could you instead share a decent picture of yourself from your device? Can you confirm if this is clear?
30/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 513 1808: Yes sir
30/09/23, 10:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know when you might be able to share the completed forms?

30/09/23, 10:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have noticed that on the front page of the form, you have left the sponsor's details blank. May I know if you are facing any challenges regarding that question?

30/09/23, 10:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you understand. The sponsor is the one who would be paying your fees for your higher education, typically your parents or guardian. I've also noticed that you haven't provided the year of university admission, indicating it's yet to be advised. May I know if you're not aware of the intake year for your higher education in India?
30/09/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 513 1808: The year is 2024 init??

06/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 513 1808: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, thank you for sharing the forms with us, I have taken a note of these and will update them in our records as well.
06/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
06/10/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 513 1808: Yes sir
06/10/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
06/10/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
06/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 513 1808: Yes sir
06/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 513 1808: I am sir
06/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
06/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 513 1808: Ooh okay 
I see
06/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
06/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 513 1808: Yes sir
06/10/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
06/10/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
06/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 513 1808: Share the videos sir

17/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nyasha,

Over the past couple of weeks, we at Edoofa have been waiting for you to connect with the admissions team and move forward with your university admission journey. However, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to get a response from your end as there has been repeated delays from your side.
17/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We do understand that you might have your reasons because of which you were not able to connect or share an update regarding the challenges. However, your absence has left a negative impression on your scholarship application file, which could result in missing out on your scholarship opportunity.
17/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence, the academic board urged us to reach out to you once again and give you an opportunity to transparently share the concerns you have because of which you have not been connecting with the team, so that the relevant solutions can be shared with you.

Today holds particular significance for us here in India as we celebrate Children's Day, commemorating the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru on November 14th. This day is dedicated to acknowledging and advocating for the well-being and rights of children, fostering an environment that supports their growth and development through various events and activities. Wishing you a joyful Children's Day, I am eager to embark on today's session. With that said, I am ready to take on today's session. Please let me know if you are ready to proceed with the session.

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
