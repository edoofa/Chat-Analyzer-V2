Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/11/23, 7:51 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: It is clear as well
22/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/11/23, 8:01 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: I am ready for the first step now. We may proceed
22/11/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/11/23, 8:05 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: I am ready. You may send the videos
22/11/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

22/11/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
22/11/23, 8:14 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: I shall begin watching the videos right now so I should be finished by 8:30 PM
22/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know I shall wait for the same
22/11/23, 9:05 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Due to writing down my summary I took more time to come up with everything. But if there is no problem may we continue with the process?
22/11/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 5:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 9:09 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you very much for your time sir. Have a great night as well
23/11/23, 6:44 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Hello. Has the time been shifted?
23/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 7:09 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Good evening. I am ready so we can continue anytime
23/11/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
23/11/23, 8:07 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: In the first video I heard the founders saying that the Edoofa program boosts the confidence of Edoofians and gives them the feeling of independence. They also said that when they came to Africa they studied successful people as well as the failures so that they understand the difference between the two groups of people.
They explained a story about a kid who wanted to make calculators. So he contacted the CEO of Hp computers and asked for spare parts. The CEO was interested in him so the CEO of Hp computers help steve jobs to realize he potential. The founders also stated that the best way to understand and stay on track with the program is to follow instructions and be open minded.
23/11/23, 8:07 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: In the second video the founders talk about the vision that Edoofa has for me as the applicant. They also talked about a student from Ghana who registered on the edoofa program. They said that after he was accepted and granted a scholarship through Edoofa he told them hisheartbreaking story when he was scammed by an agent that made him pay $1000 for enrolment fees to a Chinese university. After avoiding the student for 3 months, the agent asked for $300 more as a shipment fee for the student’s documents that were allegedly in China.
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/11/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/11/23, 8:56 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: I was able to understand everything the Founders said in the videos and it was very helpful in building  a general picture of the life as an Edoofian
23/11/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 2:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
23/11/23, 9:37 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you as well for sparing your time.
24/11/23, 2:35 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Hello. How are you doing today?
24/11/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
24/11/23, 2:49 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Glad to hear it.
24/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
24/11/23, 2:51 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: I am ready to proceed.
25/11/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning parents and my dear student!

I hope you're enjoying a pleasant weekend. Apologies for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was tied up with some unforeseen work. I've set aside this weekend for our discussion and I am now available and eager to proceed with our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can continue.
25/11/23, 10:23 am - +265 999 96 51 01: Good morning. I am ready, we can proceed with today's session
25/11/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
25/11/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday 5:30 PM.
25/11/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

25/11/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

25/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for filling out on the SOP  form
27/11/23, 12:31 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 12:33 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 12:35 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: To answer the second question entrepreneurship plays a vital role in economic development. Entrepreneurs are the driving force behind innovation, job creation and economic growth. Entrepreneurship promotes competition, which leads to lower prices, better quality products and increased efficiency. The relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development is symbiotic. Entrepreneurship is essential for economic development, and economic development provides the necessary environment for entrepreneurship to thrive. Economic development provides entrepreneurs with access to capital, infrastructure, and resources, which are necessary for starting and growing a business. In turn, entrepreneurship creates jobs, generates wealth, and contributes to the overall growth of the economy.
27/11/23, 12:36 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: After researching I have found out that GAAP stands for Generally Accepted accounting Principles. It is a set of standards and practices for accounting that helps businesses, investors, lenders, donors, and the government to evaluate the financial health and performance of a company. The importance of GAAP lies in the uniformity, comparability, and transparency of financial documents. GAAP promotes trust and confidence in the financial market by standardizing the entire process of making financial statements. It ensures that a company’s financial records are complete, consistent, and comparable which is important to business leaders because it gives a complete picture of the company’s health. It also helps govern the world of accounting according to general rules and guidelines, and attempts to standardize and regulate the definitions, assumptions, and methods used in accounting across all industries.
27/11/23, 12:38 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: To answer the fourth question accounting standards are a set of guidelines and principles that dictate how financial transactions should be recorded, reported and presented. They are mandatory because they ensure that financial statements are consistent, transparent and comparable across different industries. Accounting standards help to improve the quality of financial reporting by providing a framework for companies to follow when preparing their financial statements. They also help to ensure that the financial statements are accurate and reliable, which is important for investors, creditors and other stakeholders who rely on this information to make informed decisions.
27/11/23, 12:40 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Lastly Accounting and auditing are two distinct concepts in the field of finance. Accounting is the process of recording, classifying, and summarizing financial transactions to provide a clear picture of a company’s financial health. Auditing, on the other hand, is the process of reviewing and verifying financial statements to ensure that they are accurate, complete and comply with accounting standards. The purpose of accounting is to keep track of financial transactions and prepare financial statements, while auditing is done to verify the accuracy of financial statements prepared by the accountants. Accounting covers all transactions, records and statements that have financial implications, while auditing mainly covers final financial statements and records.
27/11/23, 5:41 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Hello
27/11/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. Please, how are you doing today?
27/11/23, 6:02 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: I'm alright thank you and how are you today. I just heard you are approaching winter that side.
27/11/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/11/23, 8:02 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes, that is correct I applied for BCom and arrival in India is during August 2024.
27/11/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 3:00 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon parent and my dear student!

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
28/11/23, 4:10 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Good afternoon. I'm alright thank you and how are you?
28/11/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/11/23, 6:50 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes, that is correct I applied for BCom and arrival in India is during August 2024.
28/11/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
28/11/23, 7:27 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes I am ready to proceed
28/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/11/23, 7:32 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes that is true. That would mean I  would have to select one among the many universities that send their offer letters
29/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/11/23, 7:49 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Greetings. We understand and I shall be available for the next session on Monday
04/12/23, 2:23 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Hello <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Dalitso!

How are you doing this evening?
04/12/23, 6:19 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Good evening. I am fine thank you and how are you?
04/12/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with today’s session?
04/12/23, 7:04 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes I am ready to proceed
04/12/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/12/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/12/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/12/23, 7:59 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes I was told about the registration fee
04/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/12/23, 8:17 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Yes this is very clear and this is what I was told
04/12/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/12/23, 9:19 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you for your time as well. Are we going to continue with session at the same time?
04/12/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, and yes we will be having our discussion at the same time, please!
04/12/23, 9:21 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Thank you have a safe night.
05/12/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
05/12/23, 6:51 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Good evening. 

Yes I am ready to proceed with today's session
05/12/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
05/12/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
05/12/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
05/12/23, 7:28 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: I understand stand it clearly
05/12/23, 7:30 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: Then the with the earn while you learn program. I should be able to complete the fees
05/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, To reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
05/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $175  will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
05/12/23, 7:52 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: I see
05/12/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
05/12/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
05/12/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
05/12/23, 8:27 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: That is going to help me greatly
05/12/23, 8:27 pm - +265 999 96 51 01: I shall let my parents know right away so they can be ready
06/12/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university.
