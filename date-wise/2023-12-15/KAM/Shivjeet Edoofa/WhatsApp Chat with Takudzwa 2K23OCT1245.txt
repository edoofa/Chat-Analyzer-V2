For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
02/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Ok
02/11/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 6:04 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Am done
02/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Yea
02/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 71 589 4957: It's clear
02/11/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/11/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Yea
02/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Ok
02/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Any dates for payment
02/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The deadlines for the offer letters depend on the universities, but it would be mostly two weeks, and please do not worry as you will be well informed in advance about the deadlines.
02/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Any other requirements
02/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am really impressed with your enthusiasm. You will be asked for the same in our future sessions. In the mean time shall we proceed with the session?

02/11/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, I am happy to see that we are connected now. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Ok
02/11/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
20/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Yea they were clear
20/11/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
20/11/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
20/11/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

20/11/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As there has been a delay regarding our session for your admission process due to the recent inactivity, and it's alright. Due to this reason, we would be moving a little backward a few days for your EWYL session with your mentor, which is on the 24th of November. So, I would like you to kindly correct the form in your orientation session availability date as the 24th of November so that we will be able to schedule a session for your mentor and share the same with them.

21/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Protons are positively charged sub-atomic particles of an atom which is the smallest part of a particle ,this is evident by an electric field where it is deflected towards the negative side and the deflection is slighter showing it heavier as compared to an electron . Electron is a negatively charged sub-atomic particle as also evident by deflection to the positive side in an electric field which is magnetic and it shows a huge deflection showing that is lighter as compared to other sub-atomic particles .Neutron is the intermediate thus is neither positive or negative and it is not deflected in electric magnetic field  and is the heaviest .
21/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Question 3
21/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Atomic number of chemical element also known as the proton number is the number of protons in an atom

21/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Isotopes are atoms of same element  with different number of neutrons hence different nucleon numbers ,they do have the same proton number and symbol of the element
21/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Isotopes are used in finding the relative atomic,isotopic as well as molecular mass by use of a mass electronic mass spectrum
21/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 589 4957: Question 5
21/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 589 4957: An acid is a substance with a pH of less than 7 but according to Brownsted-Lowry theory it is a proton donor also according to Lewis it is an electrophilic compound that can accept a lone pair of electrons and form a dative covalent bond
