29/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen hope you are well .I go by the name Tawananyasha Gondo and I’m delighted to be given the opportunity to tell you about myself .I am a girl aged 17 and I’m currently doing lower 6 at Christ Ministries in Harare and the subjects I’m studying are mathematics, biology and chemistry.

 I live with my mother my father passed away so she had been raising me well by herself since I was a baby and that only gives me the thirst to succeed in life so that I can our lives completely. At the moment she is an accountant at Earthen Fire which is in Msasa .I look up to her a lot because she is hardworking and is the reason why I am the person I am today. She has always been a mentor to me since day one she had motivated me to be at my best .Personally I think I’m an interesting person to be around and I am always keen to do something new, researching ,analysing data and learning new things.

In an addition, I also see myself as an ambitious person,very focused ,responsible, hard working, As far as my academic performances are concerned  I always do my best and strive to take the highest position .I want to make a difference in my life and prove to myself that I can reach any height as long as I’m focused .

Most importantly that my success is not determined by my background.My goal since I was a child was to study abroad and to be part of the medical field as a Lab Technologist. I do not only want to end there but I also want to open.my own Laboratories in Zimbabwe which are as good as the ones we see in developed countries .

My aim is to help other people so that they do not need to go abroad for their tests due to the lack of particular facilities  that are currently in Zimbabwe .

When I was doing my research I made a realization that India is the best place to study for my degree which will be Bachelor of science in medical laboratory technology for it is well known for its top notch education system.In conclusion, I hope that I will get the opportunity to go to India so that my dreams may be brought to life .
29/11/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your inspiring journey and aspirations with us. Your dedication and determination to excel despite challenges truly reflect your strong character.

01/12/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 234 0173: Above read through we can proceed
01/12/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/12/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
01/12/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 234 0173: Above two steps understood
01/12/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Very clear
01/12/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/12/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 234 0173: This message was deleted
01/12/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 234 0173: Following
01/12/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/12/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?

01/12/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

>>Lastly the Statement  of Purpose (SOP) which  we are required to write..

This SOP will include such information like ones attributes, their strength,  abilities amd uniqueness.

In addition it should explain why Edoofa should offer the scholarship  and why the University should also offer the student a  place in their Compas.

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
04/12/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
04/12/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
04/12/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
04/12/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
