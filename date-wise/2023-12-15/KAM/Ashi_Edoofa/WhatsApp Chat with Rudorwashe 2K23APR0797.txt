May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?

03/10/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes I remember
03/10/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
03/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Sorry sir, what exactly am I to share,my understanding of how to apply to universities, or my understanding of what an offer letter is?
03/10/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you here. I am referring to the 3 steps that we have covered.
03/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 545 9774: oh okay , thank you for the help,from my understanding , the message from the founders was profound and really verifying that Edoofa is the way to go. For step 2 and 3 , I got help and guidance in picking a desired program , and the step 4 that we are embarking on, I believe i will be given an array of universities to choose from, after which , I will then register with the one I would have chosen.
03/10/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
03/10/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
03/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes we are on the same page thank you
03/10/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Good day, sorry we had no power. I am Available today
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

It is alright. How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 545 9774: I am well thank you. I hope you are too!
05/10/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the session?
06/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 271 2858: Good afternoon. I am kindly asking to postpone the sessions to after the 29th of october as i am starting my A level exams on Monday and need to maximize the time left.
Thank you for understanding
06/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 271 2858: Rudorwashe here
10/10/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. 

 I understand that attending exams might pose challenges for your participation. I would like both you and your parents to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and our sessions can also involve only your parents at times.
10/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 635 2647: Thank you.noted.good evening
10/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening. May I know if you are ready for the session?
12/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 635 2647: The explanation is good and welcome . thank you
12/10/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 635 2647: It does really and I'm grateful for such assistance
12/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 635 2647: It's ok with me.thank you
12/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 635 2647: I want to enquire if it's possible to change degree program in case u want to change from engineering say to medicine or any other  like ict just in case u think otherwise about the current program applied for .just for my information
12/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed, you can change the course given the fact that the student is eligible for the said course. May I know if you are clear here?
12/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 635 2647: Very clear .I'm ok.we can move on
12/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 635 2647: Kindly provide more information because it's Rudo mother unless Rudo and the father are aware but I ned to know
12/10/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
12/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 635 2647: It's clear now.thank you
12/10/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/10/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 635 2647: Not clear what do mean
12/10/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/10/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 635 2647: Sure
12/10/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 635 2647: Yes
12/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 635 2647: Thank you
12/10/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Good evening. Yes we have read the letter thoroughly
03/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
03/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 545 9774: This approach works well for me,thank you. Yes , I look forward to the discussion
03/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, Rudorwashe. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
03/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 545 9774: 1.The per annum tuition fee is $7
2.The hostel fee is $1200
3.The registration fee is $750
03/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Rudorwashe, May I know if the Per Annum Tuition fee after scholarship that you have mentioned here is correct?
03/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Sorry, its $1225
03/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1225.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
03/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Will  on campus hostel accommodation still be available from the second year onwards though?
03/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, on-campus hostel accommodation will still be available from the second year onwards. The university provides both on-campus and off-campus accommodation options, and students can choose which one they prefer. If you find that on-campus accommodation suits your needs and convenience, you can continue to stay there in the subsequent years. The choice is yours, and the university offers flexibility in this regard. May I know if you are clear here? <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Oh how amazing,thank you
03/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, Rudorwashe. Now moving forward with the on-campus Accommodation. Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
03/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
03/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities have been made clear
03/11/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline more about the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill

These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of your university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you
03/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes we are together, thank you
03/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that and you are most welcome, Rudorwashe. Now that we have established your tuition fee at $1225 and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2425, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
03/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
03/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes ,this is clear,thank you
03/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, Rudorwashe. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with his hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2075. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2075 - $1000 = $1075, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
03/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
03/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes this demonstrates how it can be advantageous thank you
03/11/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in the offer letter.
03/11/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2425 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after [name] arrives in India will be $2425 - $750 = $1675. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $837.5 and $837.5, with a six-month gap between them.
03/11/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before you arrival in India or within three days of your arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
03/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 71 545 9774: This is clear thank you
03/11/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals
03/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 545 9774: I also have no doubt that my mentors will offer valuable guidance
03/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
03/11/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
03/11/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we get to connect with each other today. I was hoping for a reply from your end so that we can complete our discussion of the offer letter. 

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 9:00 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

04/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 635 2647: Good morning.i wanted to ask if it's possible to pay the fees in installments

I'm now active and ready to proceed with your session. Regarding your concern, you can pay the first part of your tuition fees separately as well to complete the whole payment on or before the 16th of November. Please let me know if we are on the same page here.
04/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. I was hoping for further replies from you so that we could proceed further and complete the discussion for the day.

However, as much as I would like to wait and proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on Monday from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 635 2647: Thank you very much.Monday then

06/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Rudorwashe!

Regarding the semester break it is usually for 20 days in the winter and 45 Days in the summer. And yes the campus are still open as well the off campus accomodation if they decide to stay here in India for the break.

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Good evening.may we have the session from 9 to 10?
06/11/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, we can. May I know if you are facing any challenges now?
06/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes, I am currently facing challenges but hopefully they will resolve by 9
06/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, and I appreciate your willingness to reschedule the session for 9:00 PM. Please take your time to address the challenges you're facing, and when you're ready, feel free to reach out, and we will proceed with the session as planned. If you have any questions or need assistance before our meeting, don't hesitate to ask. Looking forward to our conversation at 9:00 PM.
06/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 545 9774: We may proceed
06/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 71 545 9774: I was in touch with a Zimbabwean who went to LPU and I was quite convinced that it is top tier. I'd like to ask if its possible for me to apply there
06/11/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's great to hear that you'd like to apply to Lovely Professional University (LPU). As of now, your application has been accepted by Gulzar Group of Institutions and since we have shared your application with multiple universities including LPU, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter.

Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?"
06/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 71 545 9774: So in the event that I pay now then another offer letter comes and I want that one instead, do I get a refund or not?
06/11/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is a great question, and as it has been mentioned here, you will not be required to pay the registration fees again. It can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian.
06/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Ohhh okay,that's clear now,thank you
06/11/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
06/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes please
06/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
06/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *November 16th*, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
06/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 545 9774: This is clear t,hank you
06/11/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
06/11/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
06/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes I am residing in Harare
06/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
06/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
06/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
06/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Noted thank you
06/11/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
06/11/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
06/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes please
06/11/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: cLet me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
06/11/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details.
06/11/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. 

However, As much as I would like to proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as itt is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/11/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Dear Parents and Rudorwashe, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

On that positive note, I am here to continue with our session for your prestigious offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutions.

Shall we begin?
07/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Thank you

07/11/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear.

09/11/23, 10:02 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Rudorwashe. 

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Would like to let you know that I am excited as we are approaching our festive day for the year which is called Diwali. I will be telling you a brief detail about this festival at the end of our session

So with that said I am happy to take on our session for now. Please let them know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
09/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Good afternoon, sorry I was unable to join the session. I travelled and the network is poor
14/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Dear parents and Rudorwashe!

I hope you are well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your message when you were online, as it was a long weekend here in India, followed by a national holiday—Diwali, also known as the festival of lights. No worries at all! I understand that sometimes network issues can be a challenge. I hope your travels went well despite the connectivity challenges.
14/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Good afternoon. How lovely. I wish you a joyful children’s day as well. Yes I am ready to proceed
14/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by the Gulzar Group of Institutions. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutions as a collective?
14/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes we were all very excited,thank you. We have been reviewing the offer letter .
14/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
14/11/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected with the session so that we can proceed and complete it within our time frame to avoid any delays on the offer letter? @263715459774
14/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 635 2647: Yes.kindly confirm which city is the university
14/11/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, it is located in the state of Punjab called Ludhiana. Ludhiana is a large industrial city in the north Indian state of Punjab.
14/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 545 9774: After discussing about the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes and consulting those in India, we feel that we would be happier and more at peace if we were paying for an offer letter from LPU and not Gulzar group of Institutes.
14/11/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand your concern. However, universities issue the offer letter based on merit, and you will be required to pay a registration fee for this university to retain the offer letter in case your application towards LPU is unsuccessful in the next offer letter.

Regarding the registration fee, you can adjust it to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do so as an Edoofian. This is one of the benefits we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if this is clear to you?
15/11/23, 12:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Rudorwashe.
15/11/23, 12:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Rudorwashe. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was hoping for a response from your end, and it seems that my message was left unattended, leading to disappointment on your end. I would like to let you know that during the last few days, I was working on your application for LPU, and they have accepted it. Please go through the letter and let me know your thoughts on the same.
15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 271 2858: Good afternoon. We agree on LPU. How can we pay the registration fee?
Confirm its 700 and it will be to Mr Shorwi's account which we used last time
16/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will come to that as we proceed with the discussion of the offer letter, after you have a clear understanding of the same. So, shall we now proceed with the session?
16/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 271 2858: Yes we may
16/11/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes we have had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly
16/11/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
16/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 271 2858: 1.The per semester tuition fee after the scholarship is $1225 USD
2.The standard duration of the course is 4 yeqrs
3.The admission processing fee is 200 USD
4.The registration fee is $700
16/11/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
16/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes its clear, thank you
16/11/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
16/11/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
16/11/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
16/11/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes I am clear ,thank you
What is the food on campus like?
16/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: LPU typically offers diverse cuisines to cater to different tastes and dietary preferences. They often have a variety of meal options, Like Break Fast Lunch, and Dinner. Ensuring there's something for everyone. Additionally, they tend to maintain quality standards and hygiene in their dining facilities. May I know if we are on the same page?
16/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes we are, thank you
16/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes I am clear thank you
16/11/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes we are together
16/11/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes please
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before November 30th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes its clear thank you
We are in agreement
16/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes I am residing in Harare
16/11/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Noted thank you
16/11/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 545 9774: Yes please
16/11/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
16/11/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details.
16/11/23, 5:15 pm - +263 71 545 9774: I have received them ,thank you
16/11/23, 5:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 545 9774: No , I don't have any queries thank you
16/11/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -

LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
16/11/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
16/11/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.
16/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

I understand that this process might bring forth financial considerations. As our session is almost over.

18/11/23, 9:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
18/11/23, 9:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise.

Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 7:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.

May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
