11/10/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
11/10/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/10/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

11/10/23, 12:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

11/10/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
11/10/23, 1:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/10/23, 1:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

11/10/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
11/10/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
11/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Yes I am ready.

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

11/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 606 1410: I will be able to finish them by 4 PM  today. Thank you.
11/10/23, 3:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect today at 4:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to complete all the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 606 1410: I have completed the videos. Thank you very much.
11/10/23, 4:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
11/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Through watching those videos you send me , I have understood that the first  2 things are to be able to learn or being teachable and the other one is to be open minded. I have also understood that the founders of the edoofa scholarship program have spent 10 years investing in the education of edoofians by selecting the top 50 best universities in India and helping us students to be enrolled in one of them. I have also understood that these universities are all associated with the earn while you learn program thanks to our edoofa founders, and that our parents ( the edoofa founders) have always played a crucial role for the enrollment of us the children by handing in letters of recommendation to the universities.
11/10/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Tawanda, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
11/10/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
11/10/23, 6:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
11/10/23, 6:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
11/10/23, 6:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
11/10/23, 6:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success.

12/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Question 2 
Difference between magazines,  newspapers and  digital in terms of content of each media 

The differences between magazines,  newspapers and digital are that newspapers provide news and current events whereas magazines provide in depth information on specific topics for example fashion news. Another difference is advertising whereby newspaper advertisements tend to be text heavy and less colorful due to the quality of the newsprint whereas magazines are visually appealing and have high resolution images due to high quality paper and also digital advertisements are different from these two in the sense that it's advertisements can be done inform videos. When it comes to content type, newspapers are broad and covers a wide range of topics whereas magazines are specific or focus on particular topics or genre and digital covers a wide range of topics but for a limited time period for example television news and shows. Newspapers are cheaper due to daily publication whereas magazines are expensive due to quality of content and paper. Digital is for free. When it comes to audience, newspapers are generally public whereas magazines are interested in a particular group.
12/10/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263716061410 I am glad to see that you have started working on the documents. In light of the same, May I please know if you have gone through the above message?
12/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Yes I have, I think I will be able to finish at around 4.30 pm, thank you.
12/10/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at *09:00 am* for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 3:55 am - +263 71 606 1410: Question 3
The difference between journalism and studio television is that journalism conduct researches and analyses data to provide context and in depth to reports,this involves analyzing statistics, financial reports or government documents to make sense of complex issues. Journalism verifies the accuracy and veracity of the information reported,  this includes facts checking and confirming the reliability of witnesses or sources. Journalism reports and writes stories,  features and articles accurately and engagingly while  adhering to ethical standards. Journalism distributes news and information to the public by publishing articles in print, online or broadcast media. Journalism promotes transparency, accountability and fairness by exposing wrong doings and advocating for change through investigative reporting. Whereas studio television can be an opinion driven show for entertainment purposes  whereby a story is brought in for discussion and is analysed by experts and they share each other's opinions whilst being done in the most authoritative sounding way. Studio television's stories are scripted, and so valuable information is lost when editing the story for length and clarity. Sometimes studio television doesn't promote fairness and transparency by doing cover ups. Studio television doesn't cover wide range of topics due to a limited time length.
13/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Yes I agree,  thank you very much.
13/10/23, 1:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263716061410 . Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/10/23, 1:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/10/23, 1:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Yes she has, thank you.
13/10/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, I am glad to know that you remembered this conversation. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Yes we are on the same page.
13/10/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:


Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
13/10/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
13/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 606 1410: I have done so. Thank you.
13/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
13/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
13/10/23, 1:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263716061410 May I kindly know if you have gone through the above messages?
13/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Yes I have kindly gone through all of  them,  thank you.
13/10/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263716061410. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
13/10/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
13/10/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
13/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Thank you  I am kindly following.
13/10/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263716061410 Are we still connected?

I am happy to inform you that we are done with the step 3, and we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
17/10/23, 10:29 am - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
17/10/23, 10:29 am - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 606 1410: I am very excited to move to the next step.
17/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 71 606 1410: This has also motivated me very much,  thank you.
17/10/23, 10:42 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Tawanda. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.


Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
17/10/23, 10:42 am - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students.

Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
17/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 606 1410: This is great, I understand it. Thank you.
17/10/23, 10:47 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome Tawanda. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
17/10/23, 10:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 10:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
17/10/23, 10:50 am - +263 71 606 1410: I have reviewed them.
17/10/23, 10:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 10:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 10:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tawanda, as an Edoofa student, You have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 606 1410: Wow this is a great benefit.
17/10/23, 10:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263716061410
17/10/23, 10:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 10:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 606 1410: I understand. Thank you.
17/10/23, 11:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 606 1410: Yes indeed it does.
17/10/23, 11:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 11:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 71 606 1410: Yes it does.  Thank you
17/10/23, 11:10 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263716061410
17/10/23, 11:10 am - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 11:11 am - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 11:11 am - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 606 1410: It's duly noted. No there's nothing I want to inquire about. Thank you very much.
17/10/23, 11:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263716061410. On this note, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Yes I am excited.
17/10/23, 12:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to her chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
17/10/23, 12:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
17/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 606 1410: Okami will share my concerns if I encounter any. I am  now going to the examination center so ,I will not be available from now on .May you have a great and blessed day.
17/10/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263716061410, All the best for your exams.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 6:38 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Greetings to you too Admission Officer Ashi.Once again thank you for the university offer letter for Tawanda.It's an excitement moment indeed.
Yes, you can surely go ahead and enlighten me more on the whole proceedings.I am glad to learn more about it.
03/11/23, 6:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @264813364203, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
03/11/23, 6:47 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Certainly! You can surely proceed.
03/11/23, 6:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
03/11/23, 6:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion?

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/11/23, 6:56 pm - +264 81 336 4203: 1)$1000
2)$1200
3)$750
03/11/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding Tawanda's offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, his annual tuition fee amounts to $1000.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
03/11/23, 7:04 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Duly noted!
03/11/23, 7:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
03/11/23, 7:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
03/11/23, 7:07 pm - +264 81 336 4203: I understand.
03/11/23, 7:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for understanding @264813364203. In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with Tawanda's annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill
03/11/23, 7:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that Tawanda will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
03/11/23, 7:15 pm - +264 81 336 4203: If I may ask,in what situations can one be granted a 100% scholarship.Are there any exceptions? Because I noted that scholarship range is from 50-100% and from the look of things Tawanda got a 60%scholarship
03/11/23, 7:16 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Yes it's clear.
03/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, The scholarship percentage grants is based on your Statement of Purpose and your responses for the academic interview question. Our upcoming session will provide an opportunity for a more detailed discussion on this topic.
03/11/23, 7:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @264813364203. Now that we have established Tawanda's tuition fee at $1000 and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2200, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
03/11/23, 7:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
03/11/23, 7:38 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Thank you, will be looking forward to learning more on this subject.
03/11/23, 7:39 pm - +264 81 336 4203: That's significantly good news indeed!
03/11/23, 7:40 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Yes this is well elaborated,thank you.
03/11/23, 7:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @264813364203, Let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Tawanda with his hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 7:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2200. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2200 - $1000 = $1200, which will need to be paid by you as parents.
03/11/23, 7:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how Tawanda can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
03/11/23, 7:43 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Ok,noted
03/11/23, 7:43 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Yes it does,thank you!
03/11/23, 7:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Tawanda will dedicate himself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of his education. His mentors will undoubtedly provide him with valuable guidance to help him reach his academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in Tawanda's offer letter.
03/11/23, 7:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of his first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2200 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after he arrives in India will be $2200 - $750 = $1450. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $725 and $725, with a six-month gap between them.
03/11/23, 7:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before Tawanda's arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement? <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 7:48 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Sorry did you mean January 2025 or?
03/11/23, 7:49 pm - +264 81 336 4203: I mean for the payment of the second installment?
03/11/23, 7:50 pm - +264 81 336 4203: This is clear thank you.
03/11/23, 7:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, Kindly excuse me for the error dear, I really appreciate your attention to detail. I have corrected the message for the better understanding.
03/11/23, 7:52 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Thank you for the rectification.
03/11/23, 7:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @264813364203. In Tawanda's offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as *November 18th, 2023*.
03/11/23, 8:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Tawanda through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that He is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
03/11/23, 8:01 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Sure you can clarify further please.
03/11/23, 8:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on his behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 18th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 18th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
03/11/23, 8:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *November 18th* , 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
03/11/23, 8:05 pm - +264 81 336 4203: It is clear thank you.
03/11/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are really welcome @264813364203. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/11/23, 8:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/11/23, 8:11 pm - +264 81 336 4203: At the moment I am based in Namibia but I always frequently travel to Zimbabwe for the sake of the children.
03/11/23, 8:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/11/23, 8:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/11/23, 8:14 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Does he issue some receipts as well?
03/11/23, 8:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/11/23, 8:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @264813364203, Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 8:17 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Thank you for the contact details.
However,say I didn't make it paying in Harare in such a case how do I go about it from this side I am currently residing.
03/11/23, 8:17 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Well noted with thanks.
03/11/23, 8:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
03/11/23, 8:20 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Sure it's still alright you can send.
03/11/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare

03/11/23, 8:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @264813364203, Now, that you have all the details with you, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/11/23, 8:24 pm - +264 81 336 4203: So far none that crosses my mind.Would I think of any,I will surely direct them to you.
03/11/23, 8:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by *Gulzar Group of Institutes*.

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from *Gulzar Group of Institutes* as a collective?
06/11/23, 6:42 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Good evening Admission Officer Ashi.
We have surely discussed the  GGI offer letter and we are overly excited about the opportunity.Thank you.
06/11/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @264813364203. It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
06/11/23, 7:02 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Everyone is excited and supportive of Tawanda's endeavors and the golden chance he got to be able to study at Gulzar Group of Institutes.
06/11/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
06/11/23, 7:17 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Yes I do have a concern.I understand well the primary terms of admission at the GGI  in relation to the initial payments.You clearly articulated the terms of payments in order to secure the admission place for Tawanda.

However, I only got a slight challenge though it can be eventually be resolved.My situation is I am afraid I might fail to raise the initial amount of payment before the due date of 18th of November.But I am very sure that I will be able to raise the whole amount of the needed $600 by the month-end of November specifically on 30 November and I will be traveling to Zimbabwe on the 29th then will be able to meet Mr Rajan and make the whole payment.
So I was wondering if you could kindly make an exemption for me and be kind to my situation. Thank you.
06/11/23, 7:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern with us, We truly understand that you are having a challenge in raising the funds for the initial payment of $300 for the registration process. However, I would like to inform you that this deadline is shared by the university officials and hence the payment needs to be cleared before the deadline. In order to assist you better, I would like to know what challenge are you facing in raising the funds by 18th of November.
06/11/23, 7:36 pm - +264 81 336 4203: I really understand the position of the payment in relation to the university protocols.
My challenge is of late I am financially drained for I am the breadwinner of a huge family total number of 12people.Therefore, I am only able to raise the total amount after I receive my salary by month-end.I provide for health needs for my sick mother as well at the same time I am very much willing to change Tawanda's future by giving him the best that comes his way.It's only the timing of the dates that is kind of letting me down at the moment and I have tried asking for help but to no avail.And, I cannot afford to let this chance slip away from my son hence I seek your assistance to allay my situation to university authorities on my behalf and give them my word that the whole payment will be surely made by month-end of November.
06/11/23, 7:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @264813364203 I totally understand your situation that you are having financial constraint, considering your concern please allow me sometime to discuss the same from the team. I'll revert to you soon till then have a good day!
06/11/23, 7:48 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Thank you, I will be waiting to hearing from you.
06/11/23, 7:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @264813364203
09/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Tawanda, I hope you are doing well. 

Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you in the past couple of days. I have took initiative and have a discussion with the academic board and University. It's important to note that Gulzar Group of Institutes is a public university with a limited number of available seats, and students from all over the world are competing. 

Understanding your concern, the team has decided to communicate with the University officials and request a payment plan, but in order to reserve your seat you need to make a payment of minimum amount $100. In this way, we can solve the challenges that you might have and reserve the seat for Tawanda as we don't want him to lose any opportunity. Please share your thoughts with us.
09/11/23, 7:12 pm - +264 81 336 4203: Greetings to you too.I really understand the situation of the university being a large public institution that globally caters for students.I also understand the offer for the minimum payment which is quite reasonable as well as their valid reasons.
However,my plight still remains the same I barely have nothing at the moment and I tried reaching out to colleagues for assistance without success.The only chance for me to get the money is after my salary payment.I wish I could be able to secure Tawanda's place but it looks like if the date of 18November still stands am afraid I might fail my son and his dreams.The only funds that I had I had to send home 2weeks back after Tawanda's little 5year old brother was reported to be sick and was out of school for four days.If I had not sent that little I had I was going to be able to fulfill that minimum offer on time. But then,if the university insist on the date of 18 then it means I have failed my son but I know I had good intentions for him for I was to pay for the initial admission payment without any difficulties.Right now, the timing is unfortunately failing me.
09/11/23, 7:36 pm - +264 81 336 4203: I can't promise anything of late, I shall try my level best to try and secure something for him but if I fail to get then it will be unfortunate for him for it's beyond my control.But the only optimistic option that I have for now is the month-end issue.
09/11/23, 7:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I genuinely appreciate your openness and honesty in sharing your current situation. It's clear that your intentions for Tawanda are driven by a strong desire to support his dreams and provide him with the best opportunities for his education.

14/12/23, 8:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
14/12/23, 8:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 8:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
