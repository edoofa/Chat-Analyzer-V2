19/09/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Charity,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely afternoon?
20/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 371 3793: We are doing so great here how are you.have  you seen those documents above.i have send them yesterday
20/09/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
20/09/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 371 3793: I dont have the information since from the bigining she was doing it alone
20/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
20/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 371 3793: You can proceed sir
20/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
20/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
20/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Yes sir
20/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
20/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
20/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Very clear
20/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
20/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Ok i wii come back to you if any arise thank you
20/09/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
20/09/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 371 3793: No pueries if any i will asking you to clarify for me
20/09/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/09/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 371 3793: We are together sir
20/09/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/09/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/09/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
20/09/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 371 3793: We are ready for sure
20/09/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/09/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/09/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
20/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Understood
20/09/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
20/09/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Ok
20/09/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/09/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/09/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 371 3793: I can understand you
20/09/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/09/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Yes sir
20/09/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/09/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/09/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 23, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 23, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/09/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
21/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 371 3793: We are doind good and you.im busy at work .after 30nim i will be available
21/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. Certainly, Please let me know when you are available so that we can proceed with the session.
21/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 371 3793: 1630
21/09/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly we shall connect at the saif time frame.
21/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Im free now
21/09/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Sure you can clarify there for me
21/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
21/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
21/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
21/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
21/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 371 3793: This is in case she does nt have A_level Results?
21/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Understood now sir
21/09/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
21/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Sure
21/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
21/09/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 371 3793: I hope she is going to get the needed point
21/09/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one so that we have a clear understanding of the same -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
21/09/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
21/09/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Clear
21/09/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
21/09/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/09/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Very clear
21/09/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/09/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Its clear
21/09/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education? <This message was edited>
21/09/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 371 3793: No puerie
21/09/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263773713793. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Charity's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month.

03/10/23, 11:32 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Charity!

May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
03/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Yes we have gone through it you can go ahead
03/10/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 371 3793: 1) Tuition fee after scholarship is $1 225
2)Accomodation hostel fee is $1200
3)Reg fee is $750
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1225.
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1250) = $2475.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1000) = $2225.
03/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Ok i understand it
03/10/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad you understand. Given the fact that there are two options for accommodation at Gulzar Group of Institutes, which category would you like to choose for yourself?
03/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 371 3793: I would choose four seater which is cheaper
03/10/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: You can surely opt for that option. I also want to inform you that one can easily upgrade or downgrade their accommodation after coming to India, the option will stay open for them.
03/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: In this case, as you want to opt for four-seater accommodation, your per annum fee is $2225 which can be paid in two parts of $1112 & $1113 at a gap of 6 months and can be reduced with the help of the EWYL Program as well as much you want.
03/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Ok i understand
03/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: This per annum fee includes your tuition fee, library fee, living expenses, food cost, and other basic amenities such as 24-hour wifi cost, water, and electricity bills. Are you clear on this?
03/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 371 3793: It is clear
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Charity!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
05/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Very clear,how are you today
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Charity!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am fine as well dear, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2225 and so the balance fee becomes $2225 - $1000 = $1225 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
06/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Sure
07/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Now that everything has been shared, does that mean we have already in the process of paying our $750.sorry for taking you back.good afternoon
09/10/23, 7:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Charity!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 7:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss this further. For now, It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.
09/10/23, 7:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the same time, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well - 

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee of $2225, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2225 - $750= $1475, and that can be paid in two parts of $737 & $738 at a gap of 6 months (August 2024/January 2025). 

Are we on the same page here as well?
09/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 371 3793: So right now we are supposed to pay the 750  as mentioned above.i understand now
09/10/23, 7:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is good to know. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
09/10/23, 7:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 17th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 17th November 2023.*
09/10/23, 7:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *17th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
09/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Clear now thank you for clarify it for me
09/10/23, 7:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
09/10/23, 7:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
09/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 371 3793: In kwekwe
09/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 371 3793: We are residing in kwekwe
09/10/23, 8:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
09/10/23, 8:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
09/10/23, 8:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
09/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Ok thank you
09/10/23, 8:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
09/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 371 3793: Yes
09/10/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 371 3793: I welcome you also
09/10/23, 8:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
