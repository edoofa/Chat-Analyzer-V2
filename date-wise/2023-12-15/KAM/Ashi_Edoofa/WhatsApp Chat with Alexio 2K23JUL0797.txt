20/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes I am available
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.  Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 623 1288: You can go ahead
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes that's true I applied for August 2024
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

20/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes I still remember a little bit
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 186 1128: I understand that you apply for me to multiple universities and if they are interested in admitting me, I have to choose the one that I feel is the best for me
20/09/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes indeed, what you said is partially correct may I know if you recall our conversation where the registration fee along with EWYL was also discussed?
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Ok you said that once I received the acceptance letter from university, I have to pay my registration fee in a period of a month
20/09/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263781861128  I understand that we connected a long time ago, so it is completely alright to not remember what we discussed. Let me help you remember the registration process of the  Admission process in a short summary, may I know if you are available and ready to start with the discussion?
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes we can start
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.

You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
20/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes that's clear
20/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)

The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Yes that's clear
20/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes that's clear
20/09/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
20/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 186 1128: On that issue I don't have any questions, I don't know if my parents have
20/09/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I am sure they will go through the conversation, and if they have any concerns they will come up with that.
20/09/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/09/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/09/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Ok that's noted
20/09/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 623 1288: I appreciate your effort as well
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
20/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes I'm done
20/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
21/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 186 1128: Yes that's clear
21/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 186 1128: Good morning Ms Kirti how are you today
21/09/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alexio.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, I am doing great today, may I know if you are available to connect with us now since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
21/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes I'm available
21/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, may I know if you have any queries so far?
21/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 186 1128: On what you have explained yesterday, I don't have an problem
21/09/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, now let us move forward. 

2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/09/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/09/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 623 1288: You can go ahead now
21/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes that's clear
21/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes that's very understandable
21/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/09/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/09/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 5, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 5, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 5, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Ok that's very interesting
21/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 186 1128: No questions yet, you are explaining very well
21/09/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
21/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Yes they are very clear
21/09/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, As Alexio's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Alexios is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 844 9603: Yes
21/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 623 1288: So when are we supposed to pay that $150 grant
21/09/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The grant of $150 is paid by Edoofa itself, your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, and you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 5, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 5, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/09/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Ok thank you
21/09/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome now As Alexio's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? as per current status 40 students have already secured their seats, leaving 60 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Alexios is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/09/23, 10:29 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Yes am excited
21/09/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
21/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Ok thank you
21/09/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
25/09/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 186 1128: Good morning Ms Kirti how are you doing?
25/09/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alexio.

27/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Yes its clear on that
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Myself as a parent and the way i am earning  i prefer off- compus Accommodation
27/09/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, you can do that as well. Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
27/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Copied i will contact him
27/09/23, 3:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Needmore Maphosa's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
27/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 623 1288: No i wil pay to Mr Rajan
27/09/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
27/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Yaa its ok like that thanks very much
27/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
27/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
27/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Ok will discuss with Alexio on this
27/09/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
27/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 186 1128: Ok that's clear on that
27/09/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Ok on this , but can you explain more when my son come that side is everything going to be like what we have discussed nothing will change as we also be planning this side

Moving ahead, may I know if you have any other queries to ask?
28/09/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 623 1288: No thank you you can go ahead

29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
29/09/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 623 1288: Well thanks today i want to ask the one who will be contacted in the events Alexio encounter problems  like illness since he will be off the compus residing and us we will be very far away
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for asking this please. Now, if god forbid Alexio faces any illness or such challenges, in that case, the university management has dedicated people to take care of the students, and apart from that, we also have the Department of Student Welfare here at Edoofa and the officials of that department pay regular visit to the our partner universities, therefore ensuring the well being of all the Edoofians.
29/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Well thank you only what i need is contact in case of emergency if possible
29/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, you can save my contact and I will be always available to help you with getting in touch with Alexio.
29/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Thank you very much Mr Milan
29/09/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before moving ahead, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask?
29/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Confirm how much should i pay that $300 including 7% or its of $600 in all
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, I believe you are planning to do it through Mr. Rajan, right?
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Affermative thats it
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, you would have to pay a total of $300 + 7% = $321 towards the first part of the registration fee.
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Ok its clear
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries please?
29/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 623 1288: At the moment its clear to me we can go ahead
29/09/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
29/09/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

23/11/23, 8:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Alexio,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 8:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?

Let me help you here @263776231288 -

Once you gave the team a go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Lovely Professional University is one of those universities and they are currently evaluating your application, and if they decide to offer a scholarship to you, they will send you an offer letter.
24/11/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU, you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money. However, if you feel comfortable with your current choice you can continue with the same. Are you clear on this?
24/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 623 1288: Ok its clear on me
24/11/23, 7:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In that case, Wishing you a wonderful weekend and please extend our regards to your family as well!

14/12/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Alexio,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
