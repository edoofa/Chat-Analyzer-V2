09/09/23, 9:34 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Admire,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?
09/09/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 387 8649: Good to hear from you. How are you sir ? Here we are fine and hopefully Admire is fine there at school preparing for his final examination in October
04/10/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?

Wishing you a wonderful week ahead, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.

17/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
17/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

17/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Thanks for the reminder ,I still remember the process we have gone through and also that we should be able to pay the admission fees
17/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright.
17/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
17/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 826 7145: If l am not mistaken ,the student is offered a place on merit and also when he or she has shown some commitment and also should be able to follow what you are taught by the counselor , admission officer and the mentor
17/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Yes we are and I am very happy  thank you very much for the great opportunity
17/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
17/10/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
17/10/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
17/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 826 7145: We are very ready and we hope our son will remain focused and committed
17/10/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
17/10/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
17/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 826 7145: I have gone through the offers
17/10/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 826 7145: That's will be an advantage thank you
18/10/23, 1:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 1:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 387 8649: Well understood. It's good to hear that
18/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 387 8649: Thank you
18/10/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 387 8649: We are following up . Will inquire where need arise. Thank you
18/10/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 387 8649: No can you clarify to us how it is processed
18/10/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 387 8649: That's an advantage to us thank you hopefully Admire will work hard to achieve the requirements needed
18/10/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 387 8649: That's true
18/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 387 8649: I agree with that
18/10/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
18/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 387 8649: Yes am ready let's proceed thank you for your kind heart
18/10/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Admire's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Admire is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
18/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 387 8649: Yes we are eagerly waiting for that with your help. Thank you
18/10/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Admire's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
18/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 387 8649: Thank you sir for being patient with us as a family hopefully Admire will benefit more from Edoofa and have a better future . God bless you

18/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Thank you very much we will patiently wait for the update

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

08/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 826 7145: I have gone through the offers letter ,that's why I asked a question earlier
08/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you've reviewed the offer letter, you will be required to pay the registration fees within 15 days, which is before the A-level, with the help of A level Statement of entry. Please confirm if you are clear on this.
08/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 826 7145: It's clear ,I will make an effort to pay the fees within the stipulated time
08/11/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
08/11/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Thank you
08/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 826 7145: 1  $1800
2  3years
3.300 
4 yes , this was explained in earlier sessions
08/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are correct on Question 1. (What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?)
08/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 826 7145: I have checked sorry it's $900
08/11/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
08/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 826 7145: That's clear
08/11/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
08/11/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Off campus is a better option though it is still high for a civil servant in Zimbabwe ,but I am  made to understand that EWYL will assist if my son participate
08/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct and we will come to that as well. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
08/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Noted
08/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
08/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 826 7145: It is clear but like I said it will further put the fees far beyond the reach of us
08/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that well, we will come to a solution for that. Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
08/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
08/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Noted thank you ,I think we cannot afford to lose this opportunity
08/11/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
08/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 826 7145: With pleasure you may explain further
08/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
08/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
08/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Thank you for the clarification
08/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
08/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
08/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 826 7145: I am in Masvingo province
08/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
08/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
08/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Aren't there any options , Bulawayo ,if not I will make a plan
08/11/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sure, I will help you with that also. Now, if you happen to make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
08/11/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
08/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 826 7145: You may provide the details ,and may I burden you here buy asking the total charges for paying through Mr Rajan and also through Mr Charles , because I need to budget for busfare to and from Harare from my district Bikita
08/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 826 7145: *by
08/11/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sure, before that, let me provide you with the contact for Mr. Rajan and account details for Mr. Charles.
08/11/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now coming to Charges for Mr. Rajan if you decide to pay the first part which is $300 it will be a 7% charge resulting in a total of $321

And when it comes to Charles it would be $337.5. May I know if we are on the same page here? <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 826 7145: We on the same page
08/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
08/11/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions that is tomorrow as well. 

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as it is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 8:30 AM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
08/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Thank you for you time and also for clarifications ,have a wonderful night thank you once again
09/11/23, 9:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Admire. 

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Would like to let you know that I am excited as we are approaching our festive day for the year which is called Diwali. I will be telling you a brief detail about this festival at the end of our session

So with that said I am happy to take on our session for now. Please let them know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
09/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 826 7145: Good morning we proceed
09/11/23, 9:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, in continuation of the last message. We have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
09/11/23, 9:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
09/11/23, 9:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
09/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 826 7145: That's good news we,hope my son will cooperate
09/11/23, 9:38 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that and I am sure that Admire will be surly able to do that under the guidance of his mentors. The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
09/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 826 7145: I believe and trust that in him and I will make an effort to guide him
09/11/23, 9:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that @263778267145 . With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
09/11/23, 9:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
09/11/23, 9:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
09/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 826 7145: That's clear ,but  don't we have even cheaper off campus accommodation because I once heard that there are some
09/11/23, 10:08 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, I can help you with that for me able to help you better may I know where did you heard this information?
09/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 826 7145: My friend who has a child who also got a schoolarship posted me an audio from Mr Charles Jerera
09/11/23, 10:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed that could be done and there are even cheaper off-campus accommodation prices, that come with little distance from the university where accommodations are cheaper and the student has to bear $10 every month in to commute by local transport in order to reach the University. May I know if you find your information helpful?
09/11/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 826 7145: We are looking at something we could afford so that our son wont have problems
09/11/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely we will able to so that when the time comes. Now coming to our previous conversation. I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
09/11/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
09/11/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 826 7145: Thank you so far I don't have any quires
09/11/23, 10:26 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you - <This message was edited>

One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
09/11/23, 10:26 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
09/11/23, 10:26 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

14/11/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful news! Congratulations to Admire on completing his examinations. It's a significant achievement, and I'm glad to hear that he's now with you.
14/11/23, 7:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
14/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 826 7145: We hope he will pass
14/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 826 7145: I managed to share the offer letter with brother ,Admire busy viewing all the sessions we did during the term
14/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great to hear! I'm glad the offer letter has been shared with your family, and it's wonderful that Admire is taking the time to review the sessions. It's essential to ensure everyone is on the same page and comfortable with the decision. As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
14/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Everyone was really happy about the offer  they all congratulated  us for this wonderful opportunity
14/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
14/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 826 7145: My question is ,I think you applied to different universities ,is it possible Admire might get another offer letter from another university which might be cheaper ?
14/11/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, it is still possible. However, universities issue the offer letter based on merit, and you will be required to pay a registration fee for this university to retain the offer letter in case your application is unsuccessful in the next offer letter.

Regarding the registration fee, you can adjust it to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do so as an Edoofian. This is one of the benefits we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if this is clear to you?
14/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 826 7145: It's clear ,I hope and trust that you will guide us accordingly so that we may afford the fees
14/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I understand the importance of affordability, and I'm here to guide and assist you throughout the process. If Admire receives another offer letter from a different university and you decide to choose that option, we can adjust the registration fee accordingly.
14/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
14/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 826 7145: So far we haven't researched about the University but  I think tomorrow if we have electricity I will research
14/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Thank you for the assurance
14/11/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me kn ow.  As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
14/11/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications). <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities.
