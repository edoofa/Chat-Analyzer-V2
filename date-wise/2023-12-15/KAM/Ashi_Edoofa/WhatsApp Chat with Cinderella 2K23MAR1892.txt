Wishing you a great week ahead, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Good afternoon sir. Noted.
09/10/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Good afternoon sir. Am ready.
09/10/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
09/10/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Thanks for reminder through the chart and I can safely say we had covered some of the stages with the mentors.
09/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
09/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 270 4474: The charts also reminds of the EWYL Program which was being facilitated by my mentor Mr Maurice
09/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 270 4474: The registration process. If am not lost it's about the payment of $750 registration fee which will be paid as per the deadline given by the university to reserve my scholarship seat, and it will also be adjusted towards my first year’s fee. After the registration fee is paid, i will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as my VISA.
Hope am not lost.
09/10/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Yes sir. You are very clear to me.
09/10/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Yes am ready
09/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Proceed with discussion one by one
09/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 270 4474: That's wonderful
09/10/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Yes
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Yes sir. Let's continue tomorrow.
09/10/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we shall connect in the afternoon at 3:00 PM?
09/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Yes sir.
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Good afternoon sir. Am very sorry my cellphone was off today there was no electricity since yesterday evening to re charge it. Hiwever am now on line we can continue or we continue tomorrow at usually time.
10/10/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No need to apologize, I completely understand the circumstances. If you're available and ready to continue, we can proceed with our discussion now. However, if you'd prefer to continue tomorrow at our usual time, that's absolutely fine too. Please let me know your preference.
10/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Let's continue because am free already at home working on my garden and flowers.
10/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Am following it and no clarity
10/10/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Sorry something came up, let's say in October 2023 managed to raise $200 knowing fully that in November 2023 I will be having the $400 am i given the opportunity to pay like this.
10/10/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We will sure come with a plan for that. For now as it is a quite early. You wil be provided with the deadline of the fees well in advance so that you have a clear mind and prepare the finances in advance. May I know if we are clear here ?
10/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Very clear sir, if there is plan it will be in case one is given a short notice
10/10/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: There will not be a case where you will be given short notice.
10/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 270 4474: That's will be good sir.
10/10/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Am not aware of this, can you please provide the information
10/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Understood
10/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)* <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
10/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Evening. Noted sir. Let's continue tomorrow.
10/10/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Good afternoon sir. Really true. Let's continue
11/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
11/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 270 4474: But want her to start next year on the Bachelor, s education
11/10/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, that comes under option number 1.
11/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Yaa need option 1
11/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Yes, am now little bit lost, earlier you talked about starting with a Diploma level so there's no way she start Bachelor education level.
11/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If the results turn out to be unsuccessful, she will not be eligible for any bachelor course anywhere in the world. May I know if you are clear?
11/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 270 4474: This message was deleted
11/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Let's continue I am 100% that she will come out with best results. No queries with the Admission process.
11/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Cinderella's cguardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Cinderella is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
11/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Yes sir.
11/10/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Cinderella's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
11/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Will be eagerly waiting for you sir
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Cinderella.

14/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Good afternoon Mr Milan. Thanks for the exciting news.
14/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Will go through it
15/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Cinderella!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 270 4474: Good afternoon sir, gone through it
15/10/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?

Duration 3 years
Admission procedure fee $300
Examination fee per semester $100
15/10/23, 12:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Yes
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Cinderella!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter. May I know by when can we connect with each other here for the same?
16/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Good afternoon sir, sorry was committed, however now we can continue.

Can you please help with clarifications on the following such that I understand everything. 

 *Ref to 1.* The On-Campus accommodation for three AC room is paid upon arrival of the student.
 *Semister payment* . Each year got 2 sermisters can the $1800 paid in two installments, ie $900 in January then the other $900 in June each year.

 *The 50%* schoolership does it cover each and every payment. 

 *There's a deadline of 15* days for the registration payment, is it allowed to adjust it with a few more days.
16/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Sorry for the late response, was in a meeting. Everything is very let's continue
17/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Good day.
17/10/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Cinderella!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
17/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Afternoon sir, we are together, me as a parent prefer campus accommodation. We are togather.
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Clear let's continue
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
17/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Continue, clear.
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
17/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Very clear sir. Allow me to go for the 2 period payment of $300, but if I manage to get the $600 before 28 October will pay at once. Hope you understand me, sir.
17/10/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I completely understand that. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/10/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Bulawayo
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Cinderell!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Thanks will contact him
18/10/23, 1:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Share the account again, this will be good for me than to travel to Harare
18/10/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Campus or out of campus it's my expensive
18/10/23, 5:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well please, can you come again and ask the question again?
19/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Good morning sir. Was asking about payment of campus fee
19/10/23, 12:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Cinderella!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 12:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, what do you wish to know about that?
19/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Can you highlight other expenses that I must prepare to pay and which are not covered by the scholarship
19/10/23, 12:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask are you inclined towards the off-campus of the on-campus accommodation?
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Need on campus accommodation
19/10/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, the accommodation as well as the food costs are included in the total per annum accommodation costs please. I hope this is clear?
19/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 427 7295: We did not get any response on this
19/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Very clear
19/10/23, 12:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to the learning materials, they are not included in the fee, since they are considered as a personal expense of a student. I hope this is clear?
19/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Sir
19/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, is there anything that you wish to say about that please?
19/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Understood sir. So far so good.
19/10/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Clear sir
19/10/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Cinderella!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Will be ready for the further discussion
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Cinderella!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Good evening sir, ready
19/10/23, 10:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. If I may ask, are you clear till here please?
20/10/23, 5:16 am - +263 77 270 4474: Good morning sir, Very clear
20/10/23, 12:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Cinderella!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 270 4474: good afternoon sir, its clear, let's continue.
20/10/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 270 4474: No queries, let's continue
20/10/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/10/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?

21/10/23, 10:09 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
21/10/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 270 4474: I managed to go through the university website using above link you gave me yesterday and understand many things regarding the scholarship and Galgotias University regarding the visa and prro support post and Pre arrival of the international students. So no questions at the moment let's continue. Sir.
21/10/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
21/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Galgotias University is one of the best universities in India with a good campus facilities meeting international standards
21/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.
 
Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?

I trust that you and your family are doing well today.  I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

14/12/23, 5:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
14/12/23, 5:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 5:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 5:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities.
