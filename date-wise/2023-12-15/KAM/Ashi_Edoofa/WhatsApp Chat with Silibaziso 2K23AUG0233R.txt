This counseling session will take about 1 hour.

18/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 490 6217: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents. I shall wait for your response to the academic interview questions.
18/08/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 490 6217: 2.What is the reason for myopia Short Sightedness or Myopia? How can it be corrected?
Myopia is a vision disorder where distant objects appear blurry and challenging to recognize.It is caused by genetics, environmental factors,eye strain,lack of outdoor time , medical conditions and age.
Genetics: myopia frequently occurs in families,and those with one or both myopic parents are more likely to become myopic,and even there is myopia history in the families,there is a probability of following generations to become myopic.
Environmental Factors: prolonged near vision activities, prolonged reading or close work,and excessive use of digital devices can all increase the risk of developing high myopia
Eye strain: Spending a lot of time focusing on nearby items can cause eye strain, which may hasten the onset of myopia
Lack of Outdoor Time : Research indicates that kids will have a lower risk of getting myopia by spending more time outdoors than kids who spent less time outside.
Medical Conditions
people with some medical conditions like diabetes and Marfan syndrome are more likely to suffer from myopia 
Age: at most cases,Myopia begins during childhood and puberty and stabilizes by early adulthood
However Myopia can be treated.It can be treated by refractive surgery, contact lenses,or spectacles.By changing how light enters eye and focusing in on the detached retina ,eye glasses and contact lenses help to correct vision .To enhense vision ,an eye surgeon reshapes the cornea through refractive surgery such as LASIK laser eye surgery or PRK.Depending on how severe the condition is, myopia can be treated by another specific example of contact lenses orthokeratology ,whereby the cornea is briefly reshaped and it is worn at night and many other examples of contact lenses

18/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing question 1 and 2, I shall wait for your response, to the rest of the questions.
18/08/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 490 6217: 4.Health eyes are always the best since eye is the most sensive body  part ,therefore it can be mantained in following ways:
Keep a Healthy and Balanced Diet:
It is important to keep a healthy and balanced diet that includes omega-3 fats, leafy greens, nuts and seeds, to help maintain the health of your eyes. These foods help to protect the structures of the eye.
Get a Regular Eye Test:
Getting a regular eye test is an important way to keep on top of your eye health. A regular eye test allows your optometrist to track any changes to your eye and give treatment for vision issues if needed.
Quit Smoking:
Quitting smoking is hugely helpful in keeping your eyesight healthy. Smoking has been shown to greatly increase your risk of developing eye conditions such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). By quitting, you lower your risk of developing these conditions.
Tips for Eye Health and Keeping Eyesight Healthy
Limit Screen Time:
By limiting your screen time or taking breaks when looking at screens for a long time, you help keep your eyesight healthy. Screen time has been connected to issues such as eye strain, eye fatigue and disruptions to sleeping patterns.
Wear Your Shades:
Wearing your shades, or your sunglasses, when outside helps to protect your eyes and maintain eye health. UV rays from the sun are damaging to the eyes, with prolonged exposure linked to eye conditions such as cataracts. By wearing your sunglasses, you help to maintain eye health.
Use Safety Eyewear:
It is important to use safety eyewear, such as safety glasses or goggles, if you are working in an environment in which debris, or other hazardous materials such as vapour and chemicals may touch the eye. Using safety eyewear protects the eyes and maintains eye health.
Keep the Germs Away:
Keeping germs away from your eyes and maintaining good eye hygiene, is important in helping to keep your eyes and eyesight healthy. Not touching the eyes with dirty hands, not using old makeup, and regularly cleaning glasses helps to keep the germs away from your eyes.
Wear Your Glasses:
Wearing your glasses helps to protect your eyesight and give your eyes the vision assistance they need.
Tell Someone if Your Vision Changes:
It is important to tell someone like your optometrist or your 2doctor, if you experience any changes to your vision. These health care practitioners will be able to assess your eyes and detect any potential issues that are causing the vision problems, helping to keep you and your eyes healthy.
Stay Physically Active:
Staying physically active is an important part of taking care of not just your eye health but your overall health. Staying fit and active reduces risk of health issues, including cardiovascular and blood vessel related issues, that cause symptoms in the eye.
18/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 490 6217: 5.Lazy eye develops because of abnormal visual experience early in life that changes the nerve pathways between a thin layer of tissue (retina) at the back of the eye and the brain. The weaker eye receives fewer visual signals. Eventually, the eyes' ability to work together decreases, and the brain suppresses or ignores input from the weaker eye.
Anything that blurs a child's vision or causes the eyes to cross or turn out can result in lazy eye. Common causes of the condition include:
Muscle imbalance (strabismus amblyopia). The most common cause of lazy eye is an imbalance in the muscles that position the eyes. This imbalance can cause the eyes to cross in or turn out, and prevents them from working together.
Difference in sharpness of vision between the eyes (refractive amblyopia). A significant difference between the prescriptions in each eye — often due to farsightedness but sometimes to nearsightedness or an uneven surface curve of the eye (astigmatism) — can result in lazy eye.
Glasses or contact lenses are typically used to correct these refractive problems. In some children lazy eye is caused by a combination of strabismus and refractive problems.Deprivation. A problem with one eye — such as a cloudy area in the lens (cataract) — can prohibit clear vision in that eye. Deprivation amblyopia in infancy requires urgent treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. It's often the most severe type of amblyopia.
18/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview answers, however, question 3 is yet to be answered. So I shall wait for your response.

LASIK eye surgery: What is it?
LASIK is an abbreviation for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, sometimes called eye surgery or laser vision correction. Because it is performed on the cornea, LASIK is a type of refractive eye surgery that can correct myopia and hyperopia and treat astigmatism. An ophthalmologist performs LASIK eye surgery by reshaping the eye’s cornea using a laser or a microkeratome to improve visual acuity.  It is an eye procedure done to fix visual issues. Myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism are just a few eye disorders that can be treated with this laser surgery.

LASIK is a long-term replacement for power sceptical or even contact lenses. Other surgical correction procedures, like photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and LASEK, are similar to LASIK. All of the developments in the surgical treatment of refractive defects of eyesight constitute radial keratotomy.

Patients with moderate to high myopia or thin corneas cannot be treated with LASIK or PRK. They must instead undergo phakic intraocular lens surgery, which is an excellent treatment for the eyes.

It is one of the most common types of eye surgery. Many people benefit from LASIK surgery and have better eyesight. If you are considering having this operation, you should not hesitate or back down because it is one of the most successful and shortest surgeries.

This procedure is intended for patients who want to eliminate myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. Furthermore, a good advisor will be required before this procedure because an excellent companion is necessary before undergoing any procedure. Because the correct set of instructions must precede any system. As a result, having a guide will assist the patient in going through it appropriately.

 

What exactly is vision corrective surgery?
Vision correction surgery, often known as refractive eye surgery, is any surgical procedure used to rectify a refractive problem. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of lasik surgery. Many reports that their vision is better than it has ever been following refractive surgery.

 

What is Cosmetic Surgery?
Cosmetic surgery is when a person elects to have an operation or invasive medical treatment to alter their physical appearance for cosmetic rather than medical reasons.

Dermal fillers and other non-surgical cosmetic treatments like Botox, frequently used to smooth out or relax wrinkles, are not surgical. There are still dangers involved, though.

My opinion on LASIK surgery  is  it's aim to improve a person’s vision so that they can see better without glasses or contact lenses. It can also lower the likelihood of developing certain eye disorders like cataracts and glaucoma and improve a person’s general quality of life.

Although LASIK can improve a person’s appearance by removing the need for glasses or contacts, it is crucial to remember that it is a medical operation that should be treated seriously. The procedure entails cutting a flap in the cornea, the clear front section of the eye, and reshaping the underlying tissue using a laser to improve vision.
While LASIK has cosmetic advantages, it is vital to remember that the surgery’s primary purpose is to improve a person’s eyesight and overall eye health. When performed by a trained and experienced surgeon, it is a safe and effective treatment that has helped millions worldwide obtain sharper vision and a higher quality of life.
LASIK is a medical procedure to correct refractive problems and improve vision. While it may have cosmetic advantages, remember that it is a severe treatment that trained and experienced doctors should only perform. If you are considering LASIK, make an appointment with a reputable eye surgeon to determine if it is right for you.

18/08/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 490 6217: I think my question is unattended mam.
18/08/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Anytime if it's possible mam
18/08/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I did respond to your question @263774906217
18/08/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Yes please I send it
18/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response to the SOP form.
18/08/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Thank you
18/08/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
21/08/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 490 6217: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
21/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
21/08/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Optometry, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
22/08/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 490 6217: You are absolutely correct mam.
22/08/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Silibaziso.

I hope you are doing well, since we could not continue with our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
22/08/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 490 6217: I am available
22/08/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
22/08/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Yes,am ready.
22/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
22/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
22/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/08/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Yes
22/08/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
22/08/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
22/08/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
22/08/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Alright
22/08/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
22/08/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 490 6217: I understood
22/08/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
22/08/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 490 6217: It's clear.
22/08/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
22/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 490 6217: I  am following..
22/08/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
22/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 490 6217: I wanted to know if at any chance the university can give a person acceptance letter and not the offer letter.
22/08/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263774906217 Thank you for your query, let me help you explain since we would be sharing your application with many universities, you be first shared the offer letter from them, then we would be assisting you to help you understand which university suits the best for your according to your preference and after you decide on one university then the university shall generate your acceptance letter. The universities can not generate acceptance letters unless and until you finalize one of them.

I hope we are clear here?
22/08/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Thank you for clarification
22/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
22/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Alright
22/08/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great day ahead.
23/08/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Silibaziso.

18/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Ohh I think I was mistaken there.Thank you for corrections
18/09/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
18/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 490 6217: No queries

I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 02.30 P.M. I hope this time works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Greetings
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Silibaziso.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Am available, mam.
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing now with great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Am done reviewing them,mam
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
20/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Very clear mam
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Yes ,mam
20/09/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/09/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Understood
20/09/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 3, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 3, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 3, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 490 6217: It's flowing mam. Quite clear.
20/09/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
20/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 490 6217: So far so good
20/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Silibaziso's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Silibaziso is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Am sure they are.
20/09/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
20/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 490 6217: Thank you
26/09/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 490 6217: Greetings
26/09/23, 11:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Silibaziso.

27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Silibaziso!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 536 3314: Good afternoon. We are very greatful to receiving ve Silibaziso's offer letter to study in India.
27/09/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 536 3314: We are going to sit down and discuss before the stated  period to pay the 750 elapses
27/09/23, 4:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is good to know. For now, may I know if you have gone through the letter so that we can discuss the same?
27/09/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 536 3314: Yes, to me l have gone through it.
28/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Silibaziso!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
28/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 490 6217: 1.$900 USD
2.4 years
3.$100
4.$750
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
28/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 424 8576: Yes, it's clear
28/09/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
28/09/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
28/09/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
28/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 424 8576: Understood but as per research conducted Galgotias University is in an isolated area and it's major concern is on MBA and Engineering students.Please may you tell us how far true it is <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for bringing up that concern. I appreciate your diligence in conducting research on Galgotias University. It's important to clarify that Galgotias University is not limited to MBA and Engineering programs, and it is not located in an isolated area.

Galgotias University offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs across various disciplines, including but not limited to Business, Computer Science, Law, Humanities, Sciences, and more. So, there are diverse academic opportunities available for students from different backgrounds.
28/09/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding its location, Galgotias University is situated in Greater Noida, which is a well-developed suburb of Delhi, India. It is well-connected to the national capital region and offers a vibrant and conducive environment for learning and personal growth. The campus itself provides all the necessary amenities and resources for students to excel in their studies and extracurricular activities. I hope you are clear with that now? <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 424 8576: Clear!
28/09/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
28/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 424 8576: Clear
28/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
28/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 424 8576: Clear!
28/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 424 8576: Is the degree internationally recognized after the course <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 536 3314: Is there other students from Zimbabwe at Galgotias?
28/09/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your questions. Let me address them one by one.

*International Recognition of the Degree*: Yes, the degree you will earn from Galgotias University is internationally recognized. Galgotias University is a reputable institution in India, and it is recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which are regulatory bodies for higher education in India. This recognition ensures that the degrees awarded by Galgotias University are accepted and respected internationally.
28/09/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Zimbabwean Students at Galgotias*: Yes, there are international students from various countries, including Zimbabwe, who study at Galgotias University. The university has a diverse and inclusive student community, and you will have the opportunity to interact with students from different parts of the world. This cultural diversity can enhance your learning experience and provide you with a global perspective.

I hope this is clear, right?
28/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 536 3314: Understood
28/09/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
28/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 424 8576: So is the endowment plan applicable?
28/09/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
28/09/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
28/09/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
28/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 424 8576: Understood
28/09/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/09/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 536 3314: Masvingo
28/09/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/09/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/09/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 536 3314: You are welcome
28/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
28/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 424 8576: Ohh yes you can
28/09/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
28/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 424 8576: Thanks
28/09/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Silibaziso!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: From the discussion that we were having here earlier regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University. May I know if you are clear till here please so that we can move ahead with our conversation and proceed to the next steps in your admission journey?
29/09/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 424 8576: It has been all clear
29/09/23, 10:06 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
29/09/23, 10:06 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
29/09/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 424 8576: Understood
29/09/23, 10:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
29/09/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 424 8576: I see...
29/09/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
29/09/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 424 8576: No questions yet
29/09/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
29/09/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter.
