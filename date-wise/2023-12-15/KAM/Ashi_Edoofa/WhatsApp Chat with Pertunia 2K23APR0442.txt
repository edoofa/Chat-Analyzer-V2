I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

21/09/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, parents and my dear student.

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for being patient with us for the past few days, as I was not able to have a decent conversation with you.

Please let me know if you are available anytime now so that we can further proceed with our session.

21/09/23, 3:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I now have a better understanding of the situation, and I appreciate you providing this information in advance.

Before we move ahead with the discussion.

26/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Good afternoon,we can carry on with the session  I'm ready now..
26/09/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 272 8530: It has been some time and these steps I remember Pertunia responding but I will assist with what I may remember to the best of my  ability.
26/09/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
26/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thank you I appreciate we may proceed.
26/09/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
26/09/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
26/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yes we are clear sir.
26/09/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
26/09/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
26/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yes we are clear  and we'll explained thank you
26/09/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
26/09/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thank you I'm clear and following with understanding.
26/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
26/09/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thank you my understanding as per your explanation using the example 1 , Tuttion fee $1800 per year 2, Food  and accommodation fee $1000 totaling $2800 per year less $750 registration fee which gives us $2050.Now answering your question,the cost will be $2050 per year ,which can be paid in two instalments.
26/09/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct. Please also note that the numbers are an assumption for your better understanding.
26/09/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Okay I understand thankyou
26/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/09/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yes we are and I do appreciate so far  moved and bubbling with joy sir.
26/09/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/09/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/09/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
26/09/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 272 8530: This is real good and very interesting news about edoofa which any learner given an opportunity will grab with both hands I'm more than happy going through your statement.
26/09/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/09/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/09/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
26/09/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Sorry we have no power electricity my battery is getting flat I was hoping it would last ,you might be surprised when you get no response in the middle of session, I'm sorry.
26/09/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/09/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thank you I will make an effort to charge the phone some on case electricity is not established,it two days now no power.thank you be blessed too and good night.
27/09/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 272 8530: This is indeed a good gesture and that makes one to be part  edoofa family very caring.
27/09/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/09/23, 4:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 272 8530: That is wonderful sir and indeed a very good set up all for the benefit of the learner
27/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/09/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yes l am clear, following your illustration, it's quite clear sir.
27/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 272 8530: My understanding is that if  one pays $300 on or before   30/09 then the balance  $300 will be end of October as  dead line but one can still pay before the deadline which release,s pressure on parent to pay,it's quite clear correct me if I got wrong.
27/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. Pease note that the above dates are an assumption for your better understanding.
27/09/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yes I only used as an illustration but I understood it 🙏
27/09/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 272 8530: No I'm not aware you can explain sir
27/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/09/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Okay I do understand , it's more like edoofa does almost everything what a wonderful program. It's real an advantage , I pray she pass on her A-Levelshe will be starting to write her final exams next month 🙏
27/09/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am certain that she will surely pass the exam. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/09/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yah I'm  positive and it will be very important for her to obtain the passes you have indicated.
27/09/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 272 8530: We will be seeing her on the 30/09 this coming Saturday it's a visiting day at her school of which we will encourage her to give it the best short on her final exams,I will also show her out sessions we had so far .
27/09/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that. Now in continuation, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/09/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 272 8530: I. May agree to a certain level, every parent would like to see their children excel but as a parent I wouldn't agree on point number 3 ,benefit number 7.
27/09/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The same goes for me as well. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/09/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/09/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 272 8530: OK, we  as parents will encourage her to excel in her studies
27/09/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
27/09/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
27/09/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/09/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yes I'm clear sir on the solution and an indication of a wonderful program  by edoofa .
27/09/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/09/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 272 8530: On point 3 would be the last depending on the out come of her A-Level will keep on praying for her to the best and obtain the 2 grades 🙏
27/09/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that and I am certain that she will. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for Pertunia's admission process and higher education? <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thank you very much I do understand the admission process ,the cost is $600 of which $300 is paid with in days of receiving the offer letter and the balance $300 with in time frame not exceeding 30days dead line. For example if one pays $300 on 30/10/23  then the remaining $300 is  payed in full 30/11/23 deadline date.
27/09/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Pertunia's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Pertunia is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
27/09/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Oh yes we are looking forward.
27/09/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Pertunia's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
27/09/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thank you so much will be waiting for your connection     sir with all the best if lucky 🙏
27/09/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 272 8530: 🖕the end kkkkkkk broken English

03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Partunia!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University now?
03/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thank you very much I'm well and fine, hope you had a pleasant long weekend too. We can proceed with discussion 🙏
03/10/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, were you able to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
03/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 272 8530: I had a busy weekend but went through it  in passing
03/10/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
03/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Okay
03/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please do that dear, so that we can move ahead with our discussion here.
03/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Going through the offer letter my understanding is that , 1   Semester tuition fee is  900 USD.
2 Duration of course is 4 years.
3  Admission and procedure fee  300usd.
4 Registration fee 750usd.
03/10/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
03/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yes I am clear
03/10/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
03/10/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/10/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Looking at the  on-
campus accommodation, if you say 3 seater ,is it the number of students per room ? and the  AC  is it air condition ?
03/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. 3-Seater means that three students will occupy that room, and when it comes to AC, yes, please it means Air Conditioning.
03/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Ok I understand.
03/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
03/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Now how does that work for someone who is far away to check or rather visit the campus , specially on a student coning in for the first time, personally I think the on campus accommodation would be  okay for someone starting.
03/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this clears the doubt that you have here, right?
03/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Okay thank you very much for your explanation to off-campus it gives one clear mind and picture of security with 24 hour CCTV surveillance sounds safe.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Pertunia!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are now clear with the concern that you had. Now, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here?
05/10/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 272 8530: My apologies to late response I had not seen your msgs,I'm well thank you I hope you are fine too, yes if there's still time we can discuss 🙏
06/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 272 8530: When are we carrying on , i need to be clear on payung dates
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Pertunia!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. Now, moving ahead, as you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
06/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yes im clear sir
06/10/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, we are coming to that please. Moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
06/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Tes so far
06/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yes so far
06/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Dont be suprised my battey is getting flat any moment
06/10/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
06/10/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
06/10/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
06/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Im clear
06/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
06/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
06/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 272 8530: My apologies As said my battery went flat, but i will answer As asked though you Will see to it di n monday.
06/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Im very far from Harare 800k/metrs away and 450k/m away to Bulawayp the secound city, i  would love to hear about the alternative modes available in paying 🙏🙏
07/10/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and pertunia!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/10/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
07/10/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
07/10/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
07/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Good afternoon  Mr Singh my apologies gor responding late i didnt notice you,had seng msgs. Im sure you did  understand how far we are from Harare 850 k/m. In our case Mr Rajah is not possible to meet him in person.but we Will Conttact him to hear his opnioun.
09/10/23, 7:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Pertunia!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 7:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that. Moving ahead, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
09/10/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thank you very  much we are fine and well,i hope you are  too 🙏
09/10/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Tes you can send the account details
09/10/23, 7:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
09/10/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thankyou very much 🙏
09/10/23, 7:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
09/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thankyou Once more its clear
09/10/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
09/10/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Yes it is quite intrresting and motivating for one to work hard 🙏
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
09/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 272 8530: I am impressed actual it is indeed affordable considering the stretch or time frame to pay🙏
09/10/23, 8:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
09/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 272 8530: We Will do our best in the EWYL As this would be of great help indeed 🙏 so far we are moving together.
09/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
09/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

10/10/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents Pertunia!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications). <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 3:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 3:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 3:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities.
