18/09/23, 5:51 am - +263 71 349 0636: <Media omitted>

18/09/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/09/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
18/09/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/09/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
18/09/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 349 0636: lm more than ready
18/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
18/09/23, 5:13 pm - +263 71 349 0636: l've reviewed them 
Well understood
18/09/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/09/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
18/09/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Clear mam
18/09/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/09/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/09/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 349 0636: Yes
19/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 349 0636: Good morning

I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope this timing works for you.

06/10/23, 12:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! No need to apologize, I understand how important exams can be. It's great to hear that your building practical exams went well and you've completed them smoothly. Fifteen hours of exams over three days is quite a challenge, but it sounds like you handled it admirably. 

With that in mind, I am eager to reconnect and prioritize our upcoming session scheduled for this Monday at 3:00 PM. I anticipate a productive and engaging discussion. Wishing you a wonderful weekend ahead, and please convey my warm regards to your cherished family.
09/10/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
10/10/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Melisa, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Yes lm Ready
10/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 349 0636: l am a proud edoofian😊
10/10/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to heat that may I know if you are clear about your admission process til lour last conversation?
10/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Yes lm clear
10/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Yes mam

Well understood
10/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Yes l have 

😊well understood
10/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Provide me with more information  please😊
10/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Clear mam
Thank you for explaining
10/10/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Yes l do agree
10/10/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 5:00 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Clear
10/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Clear
10/10/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Well understood
10/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 349 0636: No queries mam
10/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?

Everyone is so excited.... especially me ,lm eagerly waiting to study there

18/10/23, 8:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Melissa, and we share the same excitement. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 8:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 8:26 pm - +263 71 349 0636: 6666y6
18/10/23, 8:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I did not get you well Melissa. Can you please come again and help me understand your message better? It seems as if you mistakenly sent this message.
19/10/23, 5:23 am - +263 71 349 0636: Sorry for the typing error
don't know what happened

My apologies please
19/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 349 0636: Hello good morning
19/10/23, 12:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Melissa,

No problem at all, we understand that typing errors can happen. No need to apologize. I wanted to inquire if you were able to go through the last message that I shared with you yesterday, and if you are available for us to connect and discuss your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, as we planned to do yesterday?

We are a day behind with our discussion, and hence I want to ensure we are proactive from here on so that we can move forward to the next stage in your admission in a timely manner.
20/10/23, 10:34 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Melisa,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regards to our messages from Tuesday and Wednesday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission and the scholarship offer letter from Lovely Professional University.
20/10/23, 10:34 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, we have not heard from your end since then, and as a result, I have been awaiting your response so that we can discuss your offer letter, help you complete your university admission formalities, and move forward to the next stage in your journey to India. Hence, could you please confirm if you have had the opportunity to review my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
20/10/23, 10:45 am - +263 71 442 1917: She has gone to school .she will connect with you as soon as she comes back home
20/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 442 1917: She was tied up with school work in preparation for exams 

Thank yu for understanding
20/10/23, 10:50 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand @263714421917 and thank you for sharing this update with me, we are just thrilled and excited about Melisa's journey ahead. At the same time, I would like to express a concern. As you are aware it has been over two days since we shared the offer letter with Melisa, but due to her school commitments, we haven't been able to make any progress in discussing the offer letter.
20/10/23, 10:50 am - Vilsha Edoofa: As time continues to pass, the due dates set by the university draw nearer, leaving us with fewer days to complete her university admission formalities. Hence, I am genuinely concerned that this delay might jeopardize her scholarship opportunity.
20/10/23, 10:50 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, to address this concern, it is essential for you and your family to have a clear understanding of the next steps, particularly regarding the offer letter and its associated due dates. It is critical to adhere to these timelines, as they significantly impact the completion of Melissa's admission formalities.

Our goal is to initiate a detailed discussion on the offer letter as soon as possible so that you can fully comprehend the admission process and make well-informed decisions regarding her education.
20/10/23, 10:51 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Therefore, in the meantime, given the importance of Melisa focusing on her academics and the priority of the offer letter, what we can do is, if you as parents are available, we can connect with you to discuss the offer letter right here in Melissa's admission group.
20/10/23, 10:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Then, whenever Melisa finds some time in her schedule, she can go through the discussion we had, understand the letter better, and catch up with us. This way, she won't be left behind, and she will be in a position to share her thoughts and ask any questions she might have. We can then reconnect on Tueday to ensure we are all on the same page. What are your thoughts on this solution?
20/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 71 442 1917: Its alright we can go ahead with the discussion and my main concern being the payment fees.I noted that we should deposit $700 for her admission within 30 days,is it possible to deposit half the amount
20/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 442 1917: Then will pay the balance later
20/10/23, 11:25 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your quick response, @263714421917. I understand your concern regarding the payment fees. To address your question, it is essential to follow the university's guidelines and adhere to the timelines specified for fee payment. The requirement of depositing $700 within the specified timeframe is a critical part of securing the admission and scholarship seat.
20/10/23, 11:25 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, I can empathize with your financial situation and understand that sometimes it can be challenging to make the full payment at once. As we move forward with our discussion today, we will help you understand the offer letter better, address your concerns, and answer any other questions you may have. I hope that sounds good to you?
20/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 442 1917: Okay thank you
20/10/23, 11:31 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome, @263714421917. I am glad to hear you are ready to discuss Melissa's offer letter from Lovely Professional University. To ensure that you have read it well, please answer the following questions based on the letter:

1. What is Melissa's per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What is the standard duration of her course?
3. What is the admission processing fee (one-time payable)?
4. What is the registration fee?

Once you provide these details, we can proceed with a detailed discussion about the offer letter.
20/10/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 442 1917: 1) $975 USD
2) 3 yrs
3) $200USD
4) $700USD

Sorry for the late response,was attending to my baby 2 months old
20/10/23, 7:46 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses @263714421917. As you can see in Melissa's offer letter, her course is a three-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that she will have six semesters in her degree.

After the scholarship, her per semester tuition fee is $975 making her per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
20/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 71 442 1917: So $975 is per semester?
20/10/23, 7:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is correct @263714421917. Also, moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Lovely Professional University -
20/10/23, 7:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
20/10/23, 7:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

In addition to on-campus housing, there's an option for students to choose off-campus accommodation. Many international students in India have decided to reside outside the LPU campus as it offers a more cost-effective solution. The estimated cost for off-campus accommodation is approximately $1000 per year, covering expenses like rent, food, WiFi services, and basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

These off-campus accommodations are considered safe. Students have the flexibility to prepare their meals, and they also have the opportunity to connect with a community of Edoofians from Africa who are pursuing their studies at the same university.
20/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 71 442 1917: Meaning to say if Melissa stays off campus it will be $1950+1000 to make it $2950 excluding health,exams fees
20/10/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is correct @263714421917. If Melissa decides to stay on campus, the university officials will help her settle and will be taking responsibility for her well-being, her per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
20/10/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help Blessing with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 442 1917: Very clear
20/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 442 1917: I'm trying to work out the total cost per year including all costs
20/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 349 0636: Hello good evening
Was going through the conversation that you were having with my mom

l've understood about the costs 
Since they will be accommodation fee ,how much  money is paid per month 

And the only money that we're supposed to pay  is  700 here

The other fees will be paid once lm there right?
20/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 349 0636: And l would also like to know that since per semester is 975 us 
If l work hard in Doing the EWYLP, will l be able to pay my own fees
26/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Melisa,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
26/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 442 1917: We are all in good health,hope yu are well and u enjoyed your celebrations ,apology accepted
26/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 71 442 1917: Thanks for being available once again,I was beginning to get worried
26/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 71 442 1917: Let's say from 10:00am to 11:00am tomorrow
26/10/23, 10:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your response @263714421917 and I can understand your perspective as well. I am glad to hear that you will be available tomorrow at 10 am. We look forward to our discussion and will be ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any specific topics or questions you would like to address during our discussion tomorrow, feel free to share them here in your admission group overnight, and we will make sure to cover them tomorrow.
01/11/23, 5:26 am - +263 71 349 0636: Hello everyone
Good morning


l would like to know if it is okay to pay half of the school fees amount and then pay the other amount end of November because that's when my mom will get the rest of the money

Like paying a certain amount and then finish off the other money  later but before we get a sem-break
03/11/23, 12:54 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Melisa,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the endowment plan for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 12:57 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are in good health. I have reviewed your previous message concerning your registration fee, and I want to assure you that we are here to assist you in arranging the payment plan necessary to secure your scholarship seat at Lovely Professional University.
03/11/23, 12:57 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, before we proceed with the payment plan, I would like to provide you with information about the examination fee and the health insurance coverage provided by the university. This will ensure that you have all the necessary details to make an informed decision regarding your higher education. I hope this approach aligns with your expectations and those of your family?
14/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 349 0636: A pleasant morning to you all

14/12/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Melisa,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

Firstly, I am delighted to inform you that the payment you have made for the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly in order to ensure a seamless transition in your application process. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
14/12/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
14/12/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 442 1917: Well understood
