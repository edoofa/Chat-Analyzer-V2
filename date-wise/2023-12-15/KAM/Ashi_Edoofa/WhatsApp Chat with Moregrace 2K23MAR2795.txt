05/09/23, 1:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Moregrace,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?
05/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 562 7442: All is well , however Moregrace is preparing for exams now they don't use cellphones at school
05/09/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand now. Thank you for sharing the information with me in advance. I recognize that attending school might pose challenges for your participation. I would like both you and Moregrace to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and our sessions can also involve only your parents at times.
05/09/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Thats in order. We are always available

With pride and anticipation, they embark on their higher education journey for the year of intake 2023. Their path is more than just academic; it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. This journey underscores our steadfast commitment to fostering a community where every Edoofian is not only educated but also honored with unwavering respect and care.

09/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes i recall
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 155 6299: I'm sorry for late reply we are facing electricity problems
10/10/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, if you are comfortable shall we proceed with the session ?
10/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes we may proceed
10/10/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
10/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.

Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these steps are clear?
10/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/10/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
10/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 155 6299: We are very much excited to receive the offer letter
10/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes we are
10/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
10/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Thank you for all your efforts. Your work is truely appreciated
10/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
10/10/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes I am
10/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 155 6299: You may discuss
10/10/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/10/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
10/10/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Thanks a lot i understand
10/10/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes I understand
10/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes it does
10/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 155 6299: I'm following
10/10/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Can you please enlighten me
10/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes I've understood
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yea i agree
10/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes i am
10/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 155 6299: I'm following
10/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education? <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 155 6299: I have no queries
10/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
10/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes I am
10/10/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
10/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Ok Sir
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Moregrace.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Galgotias University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for tomorrow at 11.30 AM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Now I understand ,,,,I thought your fees include hostel fees but from what I'm seeing tuition and hostel fees are 2 separate payments ,,, what I have observed from the offer letter you have just sent
14/10/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Now, regarding that, I would advise you to go through the letter and take a note of all the queries that you have and then we will discuss all of them during our session tomorrow.
14/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 562 7442: We will discuss but my worry as Moregrace' s parent is that your  fees expenses are becoming very high ,, than what we expected,
14/10/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that, however, I would advise you to keep your worry aside and celebrate the opportunity that you have received. Regarding the costs, I will help you in understanding the same by tomorrow please.
14/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 562 7442: It's ok
15/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Moregrace!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 562 7442: We went through it last night we can proceed
15/10/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Afternoon lets proceed
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 562 7442: It's ok we hope and pray for quick recovery
15/10/23, 9:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for the wish ☺️. Now, may you please answer the above questions as well.
15/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 71 562 7442: 1.tution per semester after scholarship - $900
2.standard duration of course- 5 years
3.Admission & procedure fee -$300
4. Registration fee $750
15/10/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Very straightforward
15/10/23, 10:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 10:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 10:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Ok
15/10/23, 10:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 71 562 7442: We are together
15/10/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Clear
15/10/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far? <This message was edited>
15/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Yes
15/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 10:33 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Very clear
15/10/23, 10:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/10/23, 10:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/10/23, 10:37 pm - +263 71 562 7442: I'm in Gutu which is under Masvingo province
15/10/23, 10:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/10/23, 10:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/10/23, 10:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/10/23, 10:44 pm - +263 71 562 7442: It's ok ,,however Harare it's a bit far from Gutu , last time we paid $350 for seat reservation using Charles Jerera' s fbc bank account ,,,,if its valid that can be better
15/10/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
15/10/23, 10:56 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Again we need to discuss on your total fees and see if its manageable ,
Annual tuition fee- $1800+ registration fee $ 600+ exam fee $ 200+ hostel and accomodation fee $ 2000+ student I d $13+ ERP fee $25 plus the $350 we have already paid sums up to usd$ 4988 per year,  without talking about visa , air ticket ,,, according to my calculation ,this sounds very very expensive ,,,,, considering this to be under scholarship nearly $ 5000 annually
15/10/23, 10:56 pm - +263 71 562 7442: You can share it
15/10/23, 10:59 pm - +263 71 562 7442: The other question is on A level results which is written " pending" on the offer letter . Moregrace is currently writing her exams  , we expect results in February . I saw a condition on the pending results where are we going to get them , they are not yet out
16/10/23, 5:30 am - +263 71 562 7442: We want our child to do this degree in India , and we thought if its a scholarship it was going to be cheaper scholarships are meant to lesson financial burdens and not to add ,,,, my worry now is let's say we pay the $600 and the $ 900 and we fail to raise the hostel fee what will happen to the other funds , universities that are here are not as expensive as that and yet still produce good lawyers, on another note when you people were convincing us to join edoofa you gave us contacts  of students who gave told us only of  tuition fee which will cater for accomodation ,,,,if it was $ 1800 per semester it was going to be fine but $5000 is too much per year is too much let's agree here
16/10/23, 5:48 am - +263 71 562 7442: Are there no other universities that are cheaper than Golgatias
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Moregrace!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now stay assured that we will discuss about that moving ahead toward the end of our discussion. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
16/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Yess please
16/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
16/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Thanks
16/10/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 562 7442: It's clear but the ewyl program hasn't started and the type of projects I saw being offered were for recruiting other students into edoofa only ,,
16/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 562 7442: The ewyl program once started and went into a break , it has started again and now that moregrace is writing exams we are going for a break until the exams are over ,
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Will she be safe in off campus accomodation ,,, does  this mean we will be providing food again for her to cook ,, I think what's best is to explain for us everything about provisions in the in campus accomodation and off campus accomodation ,, taking note of things like transport to the campus , food, linen ,bedding , cooking utensils ,, it has to be clear before we make any move
17/10/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Moregrace!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding this, I would advise you to share these queries with Moregrace's mentor in the EWYL group and they will assist you with that accordingly.
17/10/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to this query of yours, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the assurance that you needed, right?
17/10/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Ok thanks
17/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 210 6217: We understand
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Good afternoon sir. We are still running around for cash but we will be able to pay before the 28th of October
18/10/23, 9:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please thank you for sharing the update with me here. On that note, shall we move ahead to conclude our conversation here as well please?
19/10/23, 3:21 am - +263 77 210 6217: Yes Sir we may move on.
19/10/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Moregrace!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 155 6299: I will be available
19/10/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

19/10/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
19/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 155 6299: It's thank you very much
19/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Its ok thanks
20/10/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Moregrace!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
21/10/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 562 7442: Morning,,, yes we managed to discuss about the offer letter as a family
21/10/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?

I trust that you and your family are doing well today.  I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

Firstly, I am delighted to inform you that the payment you have made for the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly in order to ensure a seamless transition in your application process. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 5:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
14/12/23, 5:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 5:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 5:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
14/12/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Maybe you need to clarify since we already received an offer letter from Golgatias university and paid registration following the offer letters'demands , I'm missing something here , can you elaborate on LPU- Lovely Professional university
14/12/23, 8:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here -

Once you gave the team a go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Lovely Professional University is one of those universities and they are currently evaluating your application, and if they decide to offer a scholarship to you, they will send you an offer letter.

After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU from your current University, you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money. Are you clear on this?
14/12/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 562 7442: We have already done virtual tour on Golgatias , will the same thing be to LPU
14/12/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option -

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Golgatias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
14/12/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Ok thank you Ms Ashi,
