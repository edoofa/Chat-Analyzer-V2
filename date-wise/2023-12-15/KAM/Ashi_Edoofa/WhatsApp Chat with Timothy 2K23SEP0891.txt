14/09/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I have shared the invitation link, you can join the group with that link.
14/09/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Yes we can start
14/09/23, 12:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 782 1326: Received and noted and on it
14/09/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/09/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/09/23, 12:14 pm - +263 71 782 1326: Very well clear mam. I have understood.
14/09/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/09/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/09/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 782 1326: Yes mam. All clear.
14/09/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Yes i am following
14/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/09/23, 12:18 pm - +263 71 782 1326: Yes ...clear mam
14/09/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Clearly understood
14/09/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Yes we may proceed
14/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 782 1326: Yes..proceed.
14/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
14/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 087 1113: I am ready!
14/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 782 1326: Noted and proceed
14/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
14/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
14/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
14/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
14/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
14/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
14/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 087 1113: In an hour i will be through
14/09/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response @263780871113, I am really looking forward to go through your understanding.
14/09/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 782 1326: one hour we should be able to resume.
14/09/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 782 1326: This message was deleted
14/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 087 1113: I have watched the four videos
14/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 782 1326: i have gone thru the videos.
14/09/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay, as I was attending a meeting, that is good to know, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
14/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 087 1113: From the first video I've understood that success is a matter of mindset as discovered by the founders of Edoofa on their visit to Africa they met unsuccessful students who were not open to learning, would blame circumstances for their misfortunes and were not available to new possibilies and on the othe hand they also met other stufents who were successful because they went on the extra mile and were open minded to new possibilities.
And also as they illustrated on the Steve Jobs story on contacting HP for advise and latter getting an internship at Hp this clearly proved that there is always help if you are open and available to seeking it.
As the closed the first video they also urged me to *always follow instructions* and *to be teachable/open minded to new possibilities* 

2.The second video showed me a clear view of what Edoofas vision for me is like.
Unlike other agents that are willing to  do anything for money,
Edoofa is dedicated not only in offering quality affordable education but in making students like me employable and competitive on the labour market through the EWYL program which does not only subsidise my fees but equips me with competitive skillsets from the project involved.
Edoofa is also doing its best in increasing our capacity in learning and success thus  making students more responsible and independent
14/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 087 1113: 3. On the third video i also understood that for over a decade now Edoofa has put in the work to get in collaboration with the best top 250 education institutions in India by checking the quality of teaching staff and the accreditations on checkpoints given to the institutions so that we as students get the best education also with a unique culture of education and frienship through festivals.
Students are also urged to follow instructions as to be prepared and qualify in the prestigious institutions.
14/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 265 6894: My understanding after watching the 4vedios are:
Edoofa efforts in working with schools, colleges and universities in making education affordable and relevant to the 21st century skills relevant to todays industry.
The program offers so many opportunities for students on scholarships.
The SOP forms the good guidance in approach in assisting and directing the student in achieving his or her goals/ambitions.
I really benefited also after watching the videos in learning the deeper approach towards understanding need for realignment to suit todays world of technology.
14/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 087 1113: 4.The fourth video was  expounding on the (SOP)statement of purpose which is my only subjective document that gives me an opportunity to convince the admission board that i am worthy to be in the school.
14/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Thats a summary of what ive understood from the videos
14/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding @263780871113, I can clearly see that you have understood the videos really well, and I must commend @263772656894 for sharing the brief of the videos it was really great to know your mindset regarding the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
14/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 782 1326: True indeed.
14/09/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
14/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 782 1326: Noted and thank you.
14/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Noted
14/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.
14/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

14/09/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions, while we still wait for questions 1 and 5. @263780871113 could you please share your academic documents again in a picture format, since the documents are unable to download, due to some technical issues?
14/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Welcome mam. The network at this hour seem to be bad and week indeed and hence slow responces. If you may allow, we can upload the images once the network strengthen up. Our since apologies for today network glitches.

14/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 087 1113: 5. DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING 

Accounting is the daily process of recording financial transactions, managing data, and maintaining records. Auditing is a periodic process that focuses on ensuring the accuracy and legality of financial statements. In a simpler comparison accounting is book keeping whereas auditing is inspecting how accurately the records have been maintained

Accountants typically prepare financial documents and tax filings. Internal auditors review company documents for accuracy and compliance.
14/09/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents and the questions, may I know by when will you be able to fill out the SOP form?
14/09/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 265 6894: The SOP form has had been done and send via gmail
14/09/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
14/09/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
14/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Noted
14/09/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Commerce, for your higher education in India as per the October 2023 intake?
14/09/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Yes that's correct
14/09/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Thank you so much for your time with us. We really appreciate.
14/09/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772656894 thank you for your kind words. I really appreciate it.
14/09/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
14/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 782 1326: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Im ready
14/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
14/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
14/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
14/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
14/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Im following
14/09/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
14/09/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
14/09/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
14/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Yes that's not possible
14/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Yes it was highlighted in the counseling phase.
14/09/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
14/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Yes we are on the same page
14/09/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263772656894. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
14/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Noted ......if i may ask, for planning and cash build up purposes......when are these fees needed. Or given that he has found a plce at university...when is he due to start.
14/09/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query @263772656894, however, please be assured that as we move forward everything will be explained to you in detail, so shall we move forward?
14/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Noted mam
14/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
14/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
14/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Yes they explained about it in depth
14/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 265 6894: I am following
14/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
14/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Noted
14/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Noted ...no questions for now
14/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process (enroll yourself at the university) and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
14/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship.

The universities usually take a few days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due will be mentioned.
14/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is actually a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?
14/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Yes i recall
14/09/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
14/09/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university.
14/09/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they cannot take admission into that particular university for the current academic year, the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
14/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 265 6894: I understand
14/09/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
14/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Yes ...clear.
14/09/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, as you are aware your registration fee will be between $500 to $750, to be on the safer side, let us assume your registration fee is $750. Once you get your offer letter, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your registration fee of $750 to reserve/lock your scholarship seat.
14/09/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For example, if you get your offer letter on 01st March 2023 and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, which makes the deadline for your fee of $750 15th March 2023 and hence you would have to make the payment of your fee before then. Are you clear on this?

Please Note: *The above-mentioned dates are an example and we will discuss the actual dates further.*
14/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Yes...clear mam
14/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear here. Now, as per our conversation with the students and the parents who completed their admission process early, they shared that with the current economic situation in African countries, it gets a little tough for the parents to make the payment of the complete fee of $750 in one part and hence considering the same, we had a conversation with the academic board and the university officials and came up with a solution to help reduce the financial pressure on the registration fee. 

I hope you are excited to know about the solution we came up with?
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Yes i am excited now
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Oooh yes mam
14/09/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, with respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee of $750 in two parts of $375 within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

However, Considering the urgency, you stated that you want to start with your university admission in October. In that case, we would have to fasten the process as a 45-day time span is a long time and after October we do not have any intakes for 2023. So I highly recommend having a thorough discussion with your family regarding the university registration process and the proposed due date of 25th September 2023. It is essential to ensure that everyone is aware of the time-sensitive nature of the situation.
14/09/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, if you need more time to review your financial plans and determine when you'll be able to cover the registration fee, we’ll discuss that as well and we'll be happy to work with you to plan for your university admission accordingly.
14/09/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 265 6894: We need more time.  Alternatively can the intake not be moved to 2024 intake. This will allow us to build up the resources financially. Initially the plan as discussed in was targeting 2024 in take.
14/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 087 1113: This can give us more time to plan how we are to finance my education
14/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 265 6894: [9/5, 12:15] +91 89204 82888: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
[9/5, 12:15] +91 89204 82888: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
14/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 265 6894: We thought the interview now is for 2024 intake prep and not for october 2023 (next month)
15/09/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Timothy.

I hope you are doing well, I understand that @263772656894, however, may I know when I confirmed Timothy's year of intake here, may I know why Timothy agreed here if you had the clarity as a family that you want a 2024 intake?
15/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 087 1113: Afternoon ma'am
15/09/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Timothy, I hope you are doing well.
15/09/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 087 1113: I am doing well ma'am
15/09/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, may I know if you were able to go through my message above?

15/09/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Timothy, 

I hope you are doing well, I believe that you were able to have a conversation with Ms. Vilsha, she must have been able to address the query and concerns that you had in your mind regarding Timothy's higher education, based on the conversation I believe that you would be joining in the intake of August 2024, to confirm the same and get it approved by the academic board, you would have to write a mail to the *academicboard@edoofa.com* requesting for a change in the year of intake from 2023 to August 2024, once we get an update from their end, we will update the same in our record and then have a discussion on Monday.

I wish you and your family a good night and a great weekend ahead.

16/09/23, 8:20 am - Vilsha Edoofa: As you proceed with the necessary steps, I wanted to reach out and offer my assistance in introducing the Endowment Program that we discussed during our call yesterday.

Would it be convenient for us to discuss the program further at this time and proceed with the necessary steps?
16/09/23, 8:23 am - +263 77 265 6894: Yes we can
16/09/23, 8:26 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing Mr. Thomas. With the last discussion you had with Mrs. Kirti, I hope we are on the same page that you are done with step 3 of the admission cycle, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. 

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
16/09/23, 8:26 am - Vilsha Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. 

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
16/09/23, 8:26 am - +263 77 265 6894: Iam following

I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
16/09/23, 8:29 am - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/09/23, 8:32 am - +263 77 265 6894: Yes... quite inspiring
16/09/23, 8:33 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, indeed Mr. Thomas. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
16/09/23, 8:36 am - Vilsha Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
16/09/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 265 6894: Yes i am following
16/09/23, 8:39 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see that all of us are together. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
16/09/23, 8:39 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Academic Intake Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 45-day period.
16/09/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 265 6894: Understood. Well expained here
16/09/23, 8:42 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
16/09/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 265 6894: On it and we will revert.
16/09/23, 8:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely, Mr. Thomas, I am looking forward to getting a response from your end so that we can discuss all these benefits one by one.
16/09/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 265 6894: Noted we can proceed
16/09/23, 8:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
16/09/23, 8:57 am - Vilsha Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

Based on Timothy's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his responses during the Academic Interview, and his Statement of Purpose, we will proceed to forward his application to the universities for both admission consideration and scholarship evaluation.
16/09/23, 8:57 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Once the university's evaluation process is complete, you will receive Timothy's Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, outlining his scholarship percentage and tuition fees. After you've successfully completed the necessary registration formalities, you will be provided with his Official Admission Letter. 

This letter will be crucial for his student visa application. Does this clarify the first benefit for you?
16/09/23, 8:59 am - +263 77 265 6894: Yes it does clarify.
16/09/23, 9:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. Let's now discuss the second benefit -
16/09/23, 9:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Lock in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year, thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this valuable benefit with you. As you may know, universities tend to review and adjust their fee structures each year. It's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
16/09/23, 9:03 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
16/09/23, 9:03 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/09/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 265 6894: Sounds good and resonate well.
16/09/23, 9:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you have grasped this concept and on that note, let us move forward to the third benefit - <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 9:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
16/09/23, 9:08 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate as well with you?
16/09/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 265 6894: Noted. If i may ask....the $600 initial fee...is it paid once once off or it can be split into two parts.
16/09/23, 9:11 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Let us discuss this as well. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts. Hence, the fourth benefit -

*4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 45-day period.*
16/09/23, 9:12 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
16/09/23, 9:12 am - Vilsha Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
16/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 265 6894: I hear you and i am following closely.
16/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 275 1430: So far clear thank you
16/09/23, 9:18 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That is indeed reassuring Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Joyce. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for Timothy's admission process and his higher education?
16/09/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 265 6894: The question i may have for purpose of financial planning and serving to meet the commitments, when is the likey date of the $600 initial feel likely to start in terms of the month.?
16/09/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 265 6894: For the 2024 enrollment?
16/09/23, 9:31 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Thomas, the admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Timothy's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Timothy is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
16/09/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 782 1326: Noted and understood
16/09/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 265 6894: Yes lets move on
16/09/23, 9:46 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Timothy's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
16/09/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 265 6894: Yes thats in order
16/09/23, 9:46 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope that by the end of today, you will be able to send the email to the academic board as we discussed earlier. Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that Timothy's higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
16/09/23, 9:47 am - +263 77 265 6894: You will see the email shortly. Iam on it now.
16/09/23, 9:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today. Going forward, Ms. Kirti and Mr. Milan from the admissions team, who are handling Timothy's case, will be in touch with you. 

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
16/09/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 265 6894: Noted and thank you so much. We will cooperate.

04/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 265 6894: This message was deleted
04/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 265 6894: 1. $875.oo
2. $1,200.oo
3. $750.oo
04/10/23, 4:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, Mr. Thomas, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding Timothy's offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, his annual tuition fee amounts to $875.
04/10/23, 4:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
04/10/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 265 6894: I am following
04/10/23, 5:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
04/10/23, 5:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
04/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 265 6894: I am following
04/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Is the registration fee of 750 paid off once or can be allowed to be paid in batches where financial constrains come in.
04/10/23, 6:12 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The amount of the registration fee mentioned can be paid in parts as we discussed earlier Mr. Thomas. In a while, we will discuss the registration fee due, the payment plan associated with it, and the Endowment Grant allocated to Timothy, however, before we reach that juncture, our intention is to ensure that you are well versed with Timothy's per annum university's fee structure. I hope this sounds good to you as well?

With this approach, we as Timothy's admisison officer can be confident and assured that we do not overlook sharing any of the crucial details and are able to address all your queries in a structured and seamless way.
04/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Noted and following
04/10/23, 6:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for understanding Mr. Thomas. In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with Timothy's annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs

04/10/23, 6:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that Timothy will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
04/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 265 6894: So planning purposes would you advise us the time frame deadlines for these:
The $1,200.oo accomodation fee
$875.oo Tuition fee.
This will allow us to know how much time ahead more or less in making up the required funds.
04/10/23, 6:38 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely Mr. Thomas. Now that we have established Timothy's tuition fee at $875 and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2075, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
04/10/23, 6:38 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
04/10/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 265 6894: I am following
04/10/23, 6:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Timothy with his hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
04/10/23, 6:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2075. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $$2075 - $1000 = $1075, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
04/10/23, 6:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how Timothy can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
04/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Yes it does
04/10/23, 6:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Timothy will dedicate himself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of his education. His mentors will undoubtedly provide him with valuable guidance to help him reach his academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in Timothy's offer letter.
04/10/23, 6:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2075 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after Timothy arrives in India will be $2075 - $750 = $1325. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $662 and $663, with a six-month gap between them.
04/10/23, 6:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before Timothy's arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2024.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
05/10/23, 10:49 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Timothy,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. In our conversation yesterday, we were in the midst of addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission and the scholarship offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes.

However, halfway through our discussion, we did not receive a response from your end, and consequently, I have been expecting a reply from you. Could you please confirm if you had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
05/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 265 6894: Good morning.
05/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 275 1430: Morning sir we are on it
05/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 265 6894: May you reclafy . Is the subsequent semester 2024 or its 2025.
05/10/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 265 6894: Sorry for wrong spelling...I  meant May you re-clarify.
05/10/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 275 1430: The above
05/10/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 265 6894: Let me rephraise ...I am saying May you re-clarify on payments. Is the subsequent semester payment due january 2024 or its January 2025.
05/10/23, 11:22 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Thomas, and Mrs. Joyce, you are absolutely correct. The following semester is scheduled to begin in January 2025, and that is when the second part of the fee will be due. I appreciate your keen attention to detail, and I thank you for bringing this mistake to my attention.

I believe that with this clarification, we are now on the same page and can proceed with our discussion?
05/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 275 1430: Yes sir thank you our other concern is the payment for the $750 can it not be payed twice like we did last time for the $350 .n if .I may ask we once discussed something like $600 which was to be paid in twice eg $300today
05/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 275 1430: Then the other the next month
05/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 265 6894: Noted and thank you
05/10/23, 11:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Mr. Thomas and certainly, Mrs. Joyce, let us address the question you have been eagerly waiting to discuss. In Timothy's offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as *October 18th, 2023*.
05/10/23, 11:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Timothy through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that Timothy is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
05/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 275 1430: Understood thank you
05/10/23, 11:46 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Timothy's behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the *first deadline date of October 18th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the *second deadline date of November 19th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
05/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 275 1430: Now clear🥰
05/10/23, 11:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Timothy's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *October 18th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
05/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 265 6894: Noted and following
05/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 265 6894: Noted
05/10/23, 11:50 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Thomas. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
05/10/23, 11:50 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
05/10/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 275 1430: We are in Bulawayo working place .n home town is mutare where Timothy resides
05/10/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 265 6894: I am residing in Bulawayo the second big city .
05/10/23, 11:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
05/10/23, 11:56 am - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
05/10/23, 11:56 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
05/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 265 6894: Since we are in Bulawayo which is 450kms away from Harare is there any other person or account which we can deposit like what we did with the Edoofa registration fee of 350 where we were given someone's account to deposit?
05/10/23, 11:59 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Thomas. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
05/10/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 265 6894: Yes you can share
05/10/23, 12:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
05/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Good day sir
05/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Noted.....as a family we will sit down and weigh the feasible options.
05/10/23, 12:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely Mr. Thomas. Now, that you have all the details with you, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
05/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 265 6894: If possible I seek or request a summary of the planogramm on payments summary  like
1.University registration  600 Actual due date...... Balance Due date....
2.Tuition Fee ...875 ...Actual due date......balance due date.......
3.Hostel fee ---1200.....actual due date .....balance due date....
Such a summary will give us a clear picture of incoming finance commitment and  also make us work towards meeting the deadlines. Such info can be send on M'word or Excel spread sheet or in PDF form. I hope I am not asking too much but I seek your understanding since we are taking via app, some info that would have over stayed may be difficult to quickly get available on demand and so a summary of such as requested, i see it will help me.
05/10/23, 1:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely Mr. Thomas, I fully understand your request, and I recognize that having such a document would be a valuable tool for tracking your financial commitments. While the university typically doesn't provide such summaries, I am committed to assisting you with this request. 

To create a payment summary including essential details such as due dates and balances for the various components like the university registration fee, tuition fee, and hostel fee, I will need some time to collaborate with the academic board and university officials.

Once complete, I will share this comprehensive summary with you in a PDF format. I believe this document will provide you with a clear overview of your financial commitments and aid you in adhering to the deadlines.
05/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Thank you so much and I appreciate all the help and efforts I am receiving from your and the general administrative staff @ Edoofa. 👏👏
05/10/23, 1:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Mr. Thomas. Rest assured, you are not making an unreasonable request, and I genuinely appreciate your desire for clarity. I will make it a priority to deliver this summary to you as early as possible to support you in managing your payments effectively. 

In the meantime, for your convenience and to ensure you stay on top of the fee deadlines, if you prefer, I can provide a summarized version in a single message. What are your thoughts on this? Would you like us to share the message with you, or are you comfortable waiting for the document? <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Yes you can pre-share the summarized version in a single message for convenience sake.

05/10/23, 1:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Mr. Thomas. Before we move forward with our conversation and I share the insights into the university, do you have any other queries that you would like to ask or any concerns you wish to share with us?
05/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 265 6894: For now most key issues have been clarified and so for now, no more further question Your Worship.
05/10/23, 1:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

05/10/23, 1:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am delighted to hear your positive response, Mr. Thomas. I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing Timothy's offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.

05/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 265 6894: 🤝👏
09/10/23, 5:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Timothy,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to extend my apologies for not being able to connect with you on Saturday as planned. I was unexpectedly pulled into a meeting, and with the subsequent weekend, our team was unavailable. This situation caused a temporary interruption in our communication and progress.
09/10/23, 5:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that in mind, I wanted to reach out today to address the delay in our connection and explore a more effective way to move forward. Therefore, could you kindly share your availability for this evening so that we can reschedule our discussion regarding your offer letter as originally planned? 

This will enable us to plan a conversation that accommodates both our schedules, ensuring a smoother and more productive exchange of information and effective planning of the next steps.
09/10/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Good day and good evening
09/10/23, 5:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your warm wishes, Mr. Thomas. I hope you had a chance to read my previous message. In that message, I shared the significance of your availability for this evening, as it will enable us to schedule our discussion in a more structured and productive manner. 

Your response with your preferred time will be highly beneficial in planning a successful conversation and addressing any questions or concerns you may have more effectively.
09/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Noted. What would be your preferred time so that we can reschedule to be in that slotted time???
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Noted and in order.
09/10/23, 5:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you, Mr. Thomas. I appreciate your flexibility. If possible, could we schedule our discussion for 08:00 PM CAT (Central Africa Time)? This time would work well for me.

Currently, it's 09:00 PM here in India, and considering the time, we will soon be taking a break for dinner. We can reconvene at either 11:30 PM (Indian time) to continue our discussion. Does either of these times work for you? I will be prepared to address your questions and discuss the offer letter at that time.
09/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 265 6894: I understand two days , for Tuesday and Wednesday, may you allow me to be scheduled to scheduled 11.30pm then revert to 9am from Thursday. 
This is because I have a commitments with my employer boss. for those two days only. There after, 9am CAT can be fine or even 11:30pm can still be fine.
09/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 265 6894: What I mean here is the the two day Tuesday and Wednesday, due to my employers meetings, I can only be available from 16:00hrs CAT for those two day. There after we can revert back to 09:00hrs CAT if its applicable or we any other time befitting your schedule.
09/10/23, 8:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely, Mr. Thomas, that would work perfectly well. If I am getting you well, for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, that is Tuesday and Wednesday, you would be available to connect with us after 04:00 PM CAT, and moving forward you would be available during the mornings and in the evenings as well. 

If that is the case, I just wanted to confirm your availability for today as well. Would now be a good time to connect, or would you prefer to connect tomorrow after 4:00 PM CAT? Please let me know what works best for you, and I will make sure we schedule a time that's convenient.
09/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 265 6894: For easy of doing business without much interruptions for tomorrow and Wednesday i wud prefer from 4:00pm (16:00Hrs) CAT. Then there afternoon we can revert to the normal time or proceed with same if it is applicable with you
09/10/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely, Mr. Thomas. Thank you for your understanding and flexibility, I appreciate your willingness to adjust our schedule.

To confirm, we will proceed with our discussion on Tuesday, which is tomorrow at 4:00 PM CAT. I look forward to our conversation tomorrow afternoon and addressing any questions or concerns you may have regarding the offer letter.
09/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Noted and thank you Ma'am Vilsha.
09/10/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 265 6894: For interest sake ...what time is it now there in India. 
Here in Zimbabwe it is now evening @ 20.30 or 8:30pm CAT
09/10/23, 8:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome, Mr. Thomas. I appreciate your keenness to understand the time difference between India and Zimbabwe. India is three and a half hours ahead of Zimbabwe, which can also sometimes pose scheduling challenges.

Our regular operational hours typically span from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM CAT. However, we understand that certain situations may require flexibility, especially when it comes to addressing important matters related to our students. Hence in those scenarios, we are willing to extend our support beyond our operational hours when necessary, as we prioritize the importance of clear communication and assistance.
16/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 265 6894: Good day Ms Vilsha.
 Be advised that we are paying the University registration fee of $300 tomorrow 17.10.23 and the other batch of $300 will be paid before 18 November 2023 . We will honour the two split payments as agreed within the set dead lines. We will send you the proof of payment as usual. Thanking you for your support.

Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 8:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?
23/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 782 1326: Good evening Ms. Ashi. We are thankful of your support.

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications). <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
