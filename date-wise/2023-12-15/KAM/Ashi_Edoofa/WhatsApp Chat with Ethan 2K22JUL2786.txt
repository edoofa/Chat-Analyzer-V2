06/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Ethan,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Ethan’s higher education?
06/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Good day to you Ms. Kirti.
Happy to receive correspondence from you. We have not done much due to other commitments. However, we are very much aware that Ethan's higher education is fast approaching. Soon we need to gear up our preparations.
Thank you for the heads up reminder.
06/09/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I completely understand that due to some work commitments, you may not be able to do much, however, I am happy to know that you are concerned about Ethan's higher education. 

As we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians. With pride and anticipation, they embark on their higher education journey for the year of intake 2023. Their path is more than just academic; it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.

06/09/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Thank you so much for this important information. It gives us the encouragement to keep focused. We can't wait for our son's advancement in his education.

I hope you have taken note of our operational hours?
06/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Well noted.
06/09/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
06/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 267 1786: *This is correct*. However, the previous discussion also pointed out that  there is possibility to change the program of need be.
06/09/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I did not understand you well here, Could you please elaborate and let confirm if you are right now, asking to change the course?
07/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Good afternoon. Apologies for late responding. The program offered was Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering yes.
07/09/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ethan.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, however, it is the same program that has been offered to you in the first place.
07/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Thank you so much.
07/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

08/09/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 267 1786: <Media omitted>

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the identity proof, may I know why when will you be able to share the academic results?
08/09/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 267 1786: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 267 1786: I shared both only that my network is not stable
09/09/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you're having a wonderful afternoon. I apologize for not being able to engage further as I'm feeling a bit under the weather. 

As the weekend is approaching, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our session. I wish you a fantastic weekend, and please convey my warm regards to your family.
17/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ethan.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM. I understand that your schedules can be quite hectic, but I believe that dedicating just one hour of your time will be worthwhile. Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
18/09/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Well noted
18/09/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ethan.

I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can proceed with the admission process?
18/09/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes we are ready.
18/09/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Only that our network connection is perfect
18/09/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 267 1786: *is not perfect*
18/09/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, that network can be an issue, may I know by when will you be able to share your statement of entry for A- level?
18/09/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Ethan is in boarding school and he carried the statement of entry.  at their school cell phones are not allowed  so I would need to get permission from school authorities.

19/09/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Ethan,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 02.30 P.M. I hope this time works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Very understandable.
Good evening to you too.

07/10/23, 10:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ethan.

I hope this message finds each of you in good health. I want to apologize for my recent absence and my inability to connect with you. I've been unwell, but I'm glad to report that I'm now on the path to recovery and looking forward to reconnecting with all of you. Are you currently available to connect with us?
07/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 267 1786: We are sorry to hear that you have not been well. We are also happy to hear that you are recovering.
*As parents yes, we are ready to reconnect*.
07/10/23, 10:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 267 1786: Yes i recall this chart.
07/10/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 267 1786: In short the registration is a process in which we pay part of the university fees. Usually between $500 to $700 if i am not mistaken.
07/10/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
07/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 267 1786: We don't have any query as of now.
07/10/23, 11:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
07/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 267 1786: We are ready to proceed.
07/10/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
07/10/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
07/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 267 1786: The course  selected is accurate. And the arrival in India is dependent on the commencement of the course which we think we get advice from you. <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
07/10/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
07/10/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
07/10/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
07/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes i agree it is not practically possible to study at multiple universities.
07/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
07/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
07/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
07/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes we discussed the registration fees
07/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and a great weekend ahead.
07/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes we are on the same page
07/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Thank you for the information. Have a great weekend too.
09/10/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ethan.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
09/10/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Goid evening. I am ready to connect
09/10/23, 6:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
09/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Very clear
09/10/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

$2000 - $3000 Range:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
09/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Noted well
09/10/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
09/10/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 267 1786: This is clear.
09/10/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/10/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
09/10/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/10/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 267 1786: I have understood this.
09/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 267 1786: It is clear. 
how does a student qualify for a 100 % scholarship?
09/10/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
09/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes it is very clear
09/10/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping for your response soon, however, you responded late, and since it is almost past our available working hours now I would love to connect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope you will be available.
09/10/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 267 1786: We connect tomorrow. My network is a challenge sometimes.
10/10/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ethan.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
10/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes I am available.
Goodafternoon.
10/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
10/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
10/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Noted well
10/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
10/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
10/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes i have gone through the benefits
10/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Ethan, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 267 1786: This is really impressive.
10/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 267 1786: It does very well
10/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Very well understood.
10/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 267 1786: I have followed the detail. All clear.
10/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 267 1786: I am not aware and clear on this one. May you explain more.
10/10/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Now clear
10/10/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
10/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes. It seems so.
10/10/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes I agree with this.
10/10/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Clear
10/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Clear and how long is the diploma going to take to complete?
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A diploma is a 3-year course as well.
10/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 267 1786: I understand
10/10/23, 5:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 267 1786: It is clear.
10/10/23, 5:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 267 1786: No queries
10/10/23, 5:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
10/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 267 1786: i am excited yes
10/10/23, 5:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. 
With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Thank you
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ethan.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Galgotias University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 04.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 267 1786: noted.
Thank you.
14/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ethan!

I wanted to ensure that you have a better understanding of the offer letter, and to allow for a more detailed discussion of your concerns, I'd like to reschedule our conversation for tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT. Please be prepared with any questions or concerns you may have, and we will address them during our discussion. Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow. Have a pleasant evening ahead.
14/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 267 1786: I have noted the reschedule with thanks!
15/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ethan!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 267 1786: A very good morning to you.

Yes we went through the offer letter and we may discuss.
15/10/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 267 1786: 1) USD$1000 after scholarship.

2) 4 years Sept 2024 to July 2028

3) USD$300

4) USD$750.
15/10/23, 11:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across four years. This academic journey is divided into 8 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $1000 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $2000. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 267 1786: This means we have 2 semesters in a calender year. Am I right?
15/10/23, 11:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 11:35 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 11:35 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 267 1786: I understand.
15/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 267 1786: I am following.
15/10/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 267 1786: So is the $2000 for the 3 seater divided by 3 ?
15/10/23, 11:59 am - Milan Edoofa: That's a great question. The $2000 for the three-seater room is typically not divided by the number of students sharing the room. It's a fixed fee for the entire academic year. So, each student in the three-seater room would contribute $2000 for the year. I hope this is clear, right?
15/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 267 1786: It is now clear.
15/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Seems our network connection is not perfect.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes we are together.
15/10/23, 9:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 267 1786: So from the above discussion, it means that we we are on USD$2 200 per semester so far? Am I correct.
15/10/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you well here please, may I know what expenses have you included in the same?
16/10/23, 4:02 am - +263 77 267 1786: Tuition fee $1 000
On-campus accommodatio $1 000
 Examination per semester $100.

Giving me a total of $2 100 per semester.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and ethan!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you are right, however, for better clarity let us complete the discussion here as well. Mowing ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please?
16/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 267 1786: Yes very clear. 
And good morning to you too.
16/10/23, 11:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
16/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 267 1786: Yes we are on the same track.
16/10/23, 12:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 12:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 12:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 267 1786: I am very clear on this one
16/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 267 1786: So it will be $300+7%?
16/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
16/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 267 1786: With this  mode I will have to deposit $337.50. Am i right?
16/10/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Shall I share Mr. Charles's details with you here again?
16/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes you may I'm comfortable.
16/10/23, 3:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
16/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Received.
16/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000
16/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Or alternatively 
$2000+$200+$2000=$4200.
am I correct?
16/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 267 1786: *And I also have I big question as a parent*
16/10/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, what is your question please?
16/10/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 267 1786: I am not a pessimist, but I look at life as a complete entity. 
My question is: as a parent if somehow i become unable to pay for my child's education in India for one genuine reason or another, be it retrenchment at work or be it by unfortunate death, how will Edoofa handle such a case?
Let us assume that my child was having his education in Zimbabwe and such a scenario arises, there is a possibility that relatives will chip in to assist my child finish his degree program. But when he is abroad it can be a different case all together.
16/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 267 1786: I mean somewhere in the middle of the degree program. For example after say 2 years later i become unable to fund the child's education. How will Edoofa handle such a scenario?
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and ethan!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that what you are thinking is okay, however, situations like this does not arise such normally. However, let us assume that one such situation comes in your case, and you are facing financial challenges in raising Ethan's university expenses, then in that, case we here at Edoofa will be more than happy to help you in that situation and to make sure that you are well assisted in the same. It would be done in a way that you would be provided with ample time to raise the finances for the same as well as if there would be a need for a payment plan, it would be offered as well.
18/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Good afternoon. I have understood. And thank you for making it clear.
18/10/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please. Now, on that note, I believe you are clear about the worry that you had, right?
18/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes I am clear.
18/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
18/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes i can see.
18/10/23, 4:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Not queries so far
18/10/23, 4:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
18/10/23, 4:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
19/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 267 1786: Yes we had the chance to discuss.
Good morning to you.
19/10/23, 10:58 am - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
19/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 267 1786: Honestly it is a mixed feeling. One of excitement about the whole process upto the present moment. Then of curious about the process upto the beginning of the actual studies. Then also about the fears of being a distant away home and how life is going to be. Then also we are a bit in the middle of things to understand whether Galgotias University is the very best for Ethan. And also whether he will get the recognition internationally after his 4 years at Galgotias University. So yeah, we are having mixed feelings. Being happy and being curious too.
19/10/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings, and I completely understand your mixed emotions at this stage of the process. It's entirely natural to feel a range of emotions when embarking on such a significant journey.

Now, I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
19/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 267 1786: The offer letter itself is clear. May be what we may  need more clarity is the Bachelor of Tech in Mechanical engineering program itself as offered by Galgotias University. 
And also what is the difference if there be any between Galgotias University and *Galgotias College*
19/10/23, 11:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, before I answer that, can you please let me know what is it that you wish to know about the B.Tech Program at Galgotias?
19/10/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 267 1786: At the end of the 4 years, Ethan becomes a certified Mechanical Engineer right? Will he be certified in any specific branch of mechanical engineering? Example Mechanical Engineer Mechatronics or Mechanical Engineer Robotics or  just Mechanical Engineer
19/10/23, 12:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your question, letting me know of that please.

Upon successful completion of the B.Tech program in Mechanical Engineering at Galgotias University, students receive a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Mechanical Engineering. This degree is generally a more generalized qualification in mechanical engineering, covering the fundamental principles and core subjects of mechanical engineering.
19/10/23, 12:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, when it comes to the second query, Galgotias University and Galgotias College are separate educational institutions. Galgotias University is a full-fledged university and it has several different colleges based on the domains that they provide education in such as the School of Law, School of Pharmacy, School of Engineering, etc. 

On the other hand, Galgotias College/School is part of Galgotias University, and it offers a wide range of undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in various fields, including engineering, management, law, and more. I hope this is clear?
19/10/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Very understandable and clear now.
19/10/23, 12:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
19/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 267 1786: I did a bit of research because i was tied up on other issues. Am still to further up the research.
19/10/23, 12:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, I would advise you to do that please. Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
19/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 267 1786: We have considered a 2 part payment plan of $300 each.
19/10/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
19/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 267 1786: This seems the most convinient method. As for the date i am not able to give a specific date but bearing in mind that the payment must be done before 28 October as mentioned.

14/12/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
14/12/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time.
