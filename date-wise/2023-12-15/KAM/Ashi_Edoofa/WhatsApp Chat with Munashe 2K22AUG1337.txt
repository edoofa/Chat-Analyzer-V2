I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM.

Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
17/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Ok thnx wl try to connect wth u btwn 3pm and 4pm tho the schedule is tight.

19/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes that will be great.thank you.
20/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Hi Ms Kirti hope you had a good day...sorry for the late connection.
But we are online now,the network was trippling.
20/09/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Munashe.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, my day is going good and I hope your day was good too, that is alright, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes i am you can go ahead.
20/09/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since you mentioned that you remember the image. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 73 233 1142: The registration process means that when we get an offer letter from any of the choosen university we then begin the registration of the Munashe which includes payment of a certain fee to confirm or (an admission fee) that we are willing to enroll our child on the university.
20/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
20/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 73 233 1142: No not at the moment lets proceed sure.thanx
20/09/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
20/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes we hve to strive on to make it happen.
Dont know the fees yet and how long it should take to make the payment.
But yes with the will of the Almighty it should happen.
20/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Thats good news to hear Ms Kirti.
We be waiting anxiously to receive the Offer letter.
20/09/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/09/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
20/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes i hve read all the 7 benefits and quite understandable.
So with the registration fee does it vary with the university or its a known fixed amount.
20/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Which is split into 30-45 days.
Quite helpful as well and it gives us a period of searchng for more funds to complete the payment in a 1 ¹/² mnths period.
20/09/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query, let me help you explain, the registration fee does vary from $500 - $750 according to the university however, to be on the safer side we always let the parents know $750 so that they can always have some amount which can be used further which is helpful for future, I hope we are clear here?
20/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Very clear indeed thank you.Thats fine.
20/09/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
20/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes i understand on that part.
20/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 73 233 1142: What are the qualifications of this choice.
Its a good option as well because no doubt the fees will increase ine way or the other.
What should be done to get this choice?
20/09/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please let me help you understand further.

*3*. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/09/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yesit now resonates me..i say thank you to Edoofa for coming up with that help.
Very very helpful indeed.
Well explaned.
20/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 5, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 5, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 5, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/09/23, 10:33 pm - +263 73 233 1142: No im following you and its clear lets proceed.
The timeframe gives us space to  look for the remaining funds.
Thank you for that arrangement as well.
20/09/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
20/09/23, 10:37 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Please provide me with more information on that part.thank you.
20/09/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
20/09/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
20/09/23, 10:42 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Very correct
20/09/23, 10:43 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Sure it is now clear to me.thanx
20/09/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
20/09/23, 10:46 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes
20/09/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
20/09/23, 10:48 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes those will be the only options left.kkkkkkkk i agree with you.
20/09/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
20/09/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his exams, and his scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/09/23, 10:55 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes very clear go ahead.
20/09/23, 10:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
20/09/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
20/09/23, 10:57 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Quite good and helpful as well.thank you for that idea as well.
20/09/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
20/09/23, 11:01 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Ok i understand that being the last option.
Everything is very clear now.
Thank you for taking your time tonghty explaining all the staff.
20/09/23, 11:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, I am glad to know that now as Munashe's guardian, I am sure you are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Munashe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/09/23, 11:05 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes indeed i pray that the Almighty will help us secure a good University for him and also that he passes his A-level.
With the Almighty nothing is impossible.
I am excited.
Thank you.
20/09/23, 11:06 pm - +263 73 233 1142: So when can we connect again..everythng is well understood now.
20/09/23, 11:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed he will secure a good university, With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

06/10/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

07/10/23, 9:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Glad to connect with you here today. Now, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter from Galgotias Univeristy by now please?
07/10/23, 9:39 am - +263 73 233 1142: Good morning Mr Millan...we are really excited about this scholarship issue  and the fact that our son has secured a place at Galgotias university.
However we are travelling on a business trip so am unable to connect for a long time because of network.
If its possible could we please connect tonight at 9pm or on monday 9pm (zim).
We will discuss everything and you also inform us the few things that we would want to ask.
But we are so excited about this admission for Munashe.
07/10/23, 9:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, I understand that you are travelling, and what we will do in this case is that I will continue to have a discussion with Munashe, and then later he can help you in understanding about the details. Sounds good?
07/10/23, 10:25 am - +263 73 233 1142: Ok i can chip in as well whenever the network is available.
07/10/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Sure, that would be absolutely great! Now, Munashe, shall we proceed with our discussion here dear?
07/10/23, 10:27 am - +263 73 233 1142: So yes i went through the offer letter.
So as of now how much are we suppose to deposit as the admission and processing fee and what is the due date.
07/10/23, 10:31 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, we will be discussing all of that later during our discussion. Before that, can you please confirm if you would be continuing with the discussion or Munashe please?
07/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 73 233 1142: Let me continue thank you.
Munashe must be joining us as we go.
07/10/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
07/10/23, 10:43 am - +263 73 233 1142: 1....900usd

2....3 years

3....300usd

4....750usd

Correct me if i did not understand well.
07/10/23, 10:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
07/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 73 233 1142: Ok yes so its 2 semesters per year right
07/10/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is very right. Now, I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
07/10/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
07/10/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
07/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 73 233 1142: Ok sp whilst we are on no 1..the accomodation fee for 3-seater its 2000 per room for 3 people or its 2000 oer room per head.
07/10/23, 10:59 am - Milan Edoofa: It would be $2000 per head for all the occupants that would live in that room. I hope this is clear?
07/10/23, 11:00 am - +263 73 233 1142: Ok yes its now clear.
07/10/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
07/10/23, 11:02 am - +263 73 233 1142: Yes we are together a sir.thank you.
And by the way the 2000 is paid in full on or before the day of report is that so.
07/10/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we will discuss that moving ahead. Now, As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
07/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 73 233 1142: Yes very clear
07/10/23, 11:06 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
07/10/23, 11:08 am - +263 73 233 1142: Ok thank you for waivering the Admission and Registration scheme.
I thank you Edoofa for that....lets go on.
07/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 73 233 1142: ±±+
07/10/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
07/10/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 20th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 20th November 2023.*
07/10/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *20th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
07/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 73 233 1142: Yes we are on the same page,not that financially stable so i will prefer making the payments in two parts..on the 20th of Oct and on the 20th Nov
07/10/23, 11:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you can surely do that since this option is only meant to support you. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account. <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 11:17 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
07/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 73 233 1142: I am in Mutare
07/10/23, 11:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
07/10/23, 11:25 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
07/10/23, 11:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
07/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 73 233 1142: Ok sorry maybe you did not hear me well..i am in Mutare not Harare,do you have one irepresentative in this city as well.
07/10/23, 11:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I did understand what you are trying to say here, however, if it would be possible for you to get the payment done from Harare with the help of any relative or friend, then you can do that via Mr. Rajan since the transfer charges are low using this mode.
07/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 73 233 1142: Ok fine i understand will make that arrangement and send someone there as soon as i get the money by the 20th of Oct.
No problem i will be communicating with him as well Mr Rajan.
07/10/23, 11:36 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference? <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 11:39 am - +263 73 233 1142: Yes share with me the account for Mr Shoriwa then i can decide which one to use and i will notify you before i make the deposit.
07/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 73 233 1142: Hello Mr Millan send me the details please for Mr Shoriwa
09/10/23, 6:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Munashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 6:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 6:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
09/10/23, 7:07 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Ok good evening Mr Millan thays fine will make that arrangement so that i pay using Mr Shorwi's account no.
Will pay us300 on or before 20th of October.
09/10/23, 7:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
09/10/23, 7:10 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yaa i understand
09/10/23, 7:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
09/10/23, 7:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
09/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes its very clear.
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
09/10/23, 7:34 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Yes its fine..
09/10/23, 7:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
09/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 73 233 1142: Its ok Mr Millan you can go ahead and share the University insights.
Thank you so much.
09/10/23, 8:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
09/10/23, 8:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 8:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications). <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
