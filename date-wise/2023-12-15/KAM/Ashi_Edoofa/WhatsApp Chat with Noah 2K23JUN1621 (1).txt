18/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great too. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Yes
18/10/23, 5:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Ok ,Once I've received the offer letters from universities, I need to make a decision and pay the required registration fees as per deadline given so as to reserve seat. The great news is that this registration fee is deducted from next year's tuition fee!
18/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
18/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 71 936 1239: As of now I don't have any queries
18/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 8:26 pm - +263 71 936 1239: That's fantastic news!  Thank you so much for the special endowment and your tireless efforts in making education more affordable and high-quality for us!  I'm truly excited and grateful for this opportunity to shape a brighter future
18/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 71 936 1239: You may proceed
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Noah, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 71 936 1239: I'm beyond thrilled to hear that
18/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 936 1239: It resonated with me deeply
18/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Absolutely amazing news
18/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 936 1239: I think everything is clear
18/10/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Currently, I don't have any queries regarding the admission process. From my understanding, the registration fee is expected to be between 500 to 750. I also came across information about a scholarship grant of 150. This means that if the registration fee amounts to 750, I would only need to pay 600. Once this payment is completed, the entire 750 will be adjusted from next year's fee. Please correct me if I have misunderstood any details. Thank you."
18/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are absolutely correct here, this $750 will be adjusted towards your first year's tuition fee.
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 936 1239: I have also noted that the cost of higher education falls within the range of 2000 to 3000 per annum.  .So, assuming that the cost of education is 3000 and registration fee is 750, based on the information provided, I would only need to pay 750 after receiving offer letter and 2250 for next year's fee.
18/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please and this 2250 can be paid in two installments of 1125 one within the Initial 3 days after you arrive in India in august 2024 and the remaining in January 2025.
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Ok so I think I have clear understanding of the information shared
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
18/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 71 936 1239: I'm more than happy
18/10/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
18/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Ok thank you for your time , have a blessed day as well
07/11/23, 10:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Noah,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
07/11/23, 10:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 04:30 PM to 07:30 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

08/11/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings again

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
08/11/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
08/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Indeed. I'm truly excited
08/11/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
08/11/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Absolutely, I have a question regarding accommodation
08/11/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263719361239 I am really happy to see that you are so enthusiastic about your letter and I would appreciate you noting down all the queries you so that we can go through them one by one once we are done discussing the letter may I know if we are together so far?
08/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Yes
08/11/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 936 1239: 1.us900
2.5 years
3.us300
4.us600 after 150grant
08/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
08/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Yes
08/11/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
08/11/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Ok
08/11/23, 5:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
08/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Absolutely
08/11/23, 5:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
08/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 936 1239: It is clear
08/11/23, 5:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
08/11/23, 5:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far? <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 71 936 1239: I can see
08/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 71 936 1239: I'm following
08/11/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are following Noah. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a *$150 grant* applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
08/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 71 936 1239: If possible
08/11/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 649 7971: So you are saying the deadline for registration fee is 16 November 2023??
08/11/23, 5:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263776497971 The deadline for the registration fee is 22nd November 2023, please.
08/11/23, 5:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
08/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 649 7971: Oky noted with thanks
08/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Okay
08/11/23, 5:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
08/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Yes
08/11/23, 5:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
08/11/23, 5:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
08/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 936 1239: No , I'm currently staying in Masvingo
08/11/23, 5:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
08/11/23, 5:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
08/11/23, 5:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Ok
08/11/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
08/11/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charle's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
08/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Yes
08/11/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
08/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Noted
08/11/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright Noah, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
08/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 71 936 1239: So it is 2800 per annum without food
08/11/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please this $2800 includes your tuition fee, examination fee, and Off-Campus Accommodation Fee with food. May I know if you would like to know how can you make this cost more affordable?
08/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Yes
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
08/11/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Yes
08/11/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
08/11/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
08/11/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
08/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Yes
08/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
08/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
08/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 71 936 1239: I think everything is clear
08/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear so far. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
08/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
08/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
08/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
08/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
08/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities.

08/11/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: These resources are designed to help you familiarize yourself with the university and its academic environment, even when physical visits are not possible.
08/11/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
08/11/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
08/11/23, 6:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Tuesday which is 14th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
08/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Absolutely , we are going to have a deeper discussion with family members
08/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Okay
08/11/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We will be connecting on the 14th since we have one of the biggest festivals coming up *Diwali*, also known as Deepavali, is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
08/11/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
08/11/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 71 936 1239: That sounds amazing! I'm looking forward to connecting on the 14th and learning more. It seems like a vibrant and joyous celebration that brings people together. Thank you for sharing this information with me.
08/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I am looking forward to connecting with you on the 14th. You are most welcome celebrations like these are indeed vibrant and have a wonderful way of uniting people. It's always a pleasure to share such cultural moments.
14/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 649 7971: How are you Ms kirti
14/11/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Noah.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns?
14/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. As we were to connect today on the 14th, I have scheduled our discussion today at 08:00 pm CAT, I hope you will be available to connect with us at that time.
14/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 649 7971: Oky ms Kirti noted with thanks
14/11/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
14/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 649 7971: I'm available
14/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
14/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 649 7971: Yes we have discussed about it and we are pleased to inform you that  we have decided to pay the registration fees for Noah tommorow  through Mr Rajan
14/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 649 7971: We have reviewed the offer letter and it was absolutely excellent
14/11/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263776497971 It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
14/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 649 7971: Can you please clarify on out-campus accommodation, are there any transport cost from outdoor to campus or the houses are close to the university and who will provide food to the students on out campus acc
14/11/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand your concern here. The off-campus accommodation does include food as well. The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. In terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as they are very close to the university. It will either be within walking distance or a short ride on local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 per month if students want to stay a bit further away from the university. Please let me know if this is clear to you as well?
14/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 649 7971: I want him to stay close to the campus
14/11/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please do not worry about that we will be helping him with the off-campus accommodation.
14/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 649 7971: Noah is going his registration fee of 600us  by tomorrow to Mr Rajaan in Harare
14/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 649 7971: After paying this fee what's next
14/11/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I will get back to your query here.
14/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
14/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 649 7971: We don't have
14/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
14/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 649 7971: Yes
14/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
14/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
14/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
14/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: .vcf (file attached)
14/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 649 7971: Thank you for sharing their contact details
14/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 22, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
14/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 649 7971: That one of paying 600 at once is more viable
14/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
14/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 649 7971: We are going to pay  hard cash to Mr Rajaan tommorrow
14/11/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly. 

As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
14/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Yes
14/11/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
14/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process.
14/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 649 7971: Noted with thanks
14/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to your query here, after this step we would be waiting for updates from more universities, please.
14/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 936 1239: What do you mean
14/11/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
14/11/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability
14/11/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
14/11/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
14/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 936 1239: yes
14/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
14/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 936 1239: I'm not aware
14/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
14/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Thank you for the clarity
14/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
14/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 71 936 1239: Ok thank you for your  time . Have a wonderful day as well
14/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you.
15/11/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Noah.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday since you mentioned were to deposit the registration balance today, may I know if you have any update to share regarding the same?

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications). <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 7:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 7:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 7:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
