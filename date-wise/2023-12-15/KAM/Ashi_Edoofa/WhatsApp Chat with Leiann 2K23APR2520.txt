It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*
10/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Yes l have finished going  through  those, it's so exciting.
10/10/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/10/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
10/10/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Well good  to hear that,  so pleasing.I  thank you
10/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Yes lm moving with you and understanding your  efforts to make our life easier. We greatly  appreciate
10/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Thank  you  for the explanation.  So after  getting  the offer letter  from the university,  do you mean Edoofa  will cover us  $150 then we will pay $600. 
Did l understand  properly
Thank you so much
10/10/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 411 1052: So as to reach $750 needed  by the university.  Thanks
10/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Thank you  for your kind explanations, we now on the same page. Thanks  once again
10/10/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Yes it's good  to  have more of the information those lm waiting  for my child  exams  outcome.
Reason why , so we can prepare  our finance ahead since Zim economy is not that stable
10/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
11/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Hello  Sir, Sorry  l can only catch up by 6:00pm. Thanks so much
11/10/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright please let me know when you are available so that we can proceed with the session.
11/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Hello  Sir, now l reached home so can we proceed.
11/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Thanks
11/10/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, for further continuation. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
11/10/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 411 1052: I think on this one l have to sit down with the  child so we have one point. Thank you
11/10/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, before that  Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one so -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
11/10/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/10/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 411 1052: OK is it  by fact that  if he/she fails the current  exams.   That's when  this option  jets in.
11/10/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct.
11/10/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
11/10/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Yes it's so clear . Thanks
11/10/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 411 1052: No queries about  these. Thank you
11/10/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Leiann's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Leiann is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
11/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Yes please lm opening  to for the offer letter and lm very much  confident that with her, you and us parent nothing is impossible.
I'm going to pray so hard so that she can be amongst the 63 positions for  this month. Thank you
11/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your optimism and dedication are truly commendable. We share your enthusiasm and determination to secure a scholarship seat and endowment for Leiann.  Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Leiann application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
11/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Thank  you  very much  for the time we shared  on these  sessions. 
I will  wait and  hear from you . Thank you  for the hard work you  are doing.
16/11/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Leiann!
16/11/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional  University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/11/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

17/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Greetings to you too.Yes l am available
17/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
17/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Thank you very much sir. It was indeed  great news for me to receive an offer letter from such a good university.
17/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Thank you very much sir. I went through the offer letter but l had some questions that l would like to ask.
17/11/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Thank you very much sir. Yes the approach is very great because l believe l will get a better understanding of some the issues as well.
17/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 719 3568: 1.$2450 USD
2. 4 years
3. $200 USD
4.$700 USD
17/11/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if the answer to question 1 is correct?
17/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Oh l am sorry about that l misread the question it's actually $1225 USD
17/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
17/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes sir l understood the calculations.But l don't understand the part which states that after the scholarship or during the scholarship
17/11/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The fees mentioned here are after the scholarship percentage has been applied. All the breakdowns we'll be providing include the scholarships. Please let me know if you are clear here.
17/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Alright now l have understood. Thank you very much Sir.
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
17/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes sir l am very clear
17/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
17/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes sir l am very clear about that. Thank you very much for the information l am following.
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2450 (tuition fees) + $1000 (accommodation fees) = $3450, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
17/11/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
17/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes sir l have understood.
17/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $3450. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $3450 - $1000 = $2450, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Alright sir l have a few questions l would like to ask concerning the payments and accomodation.
17/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 719 3568: My question is that  the account details stated in the offer letter is a foreign bank to me because l am here in Zimbabwe. So how will l get the money to be payed into the account  stated in the offer letter. Thank you very much.
17/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 719 3568: And my second question is you stated that the off compus accomodation is safe . Is it safer than the on compus accomodation?And if it is safe how safe is it?.Thank you very much sir.
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes it does . Thank you very much sir
17/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am coming to that very soon, dear.
17/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Alright thank you very much sir.
17/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. Also, in terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as it is very near to the university. It will be either walking distance or local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 every month. Coming to more about the safety, the accommodations are guarded by security guards with 24hr CCTV surveillance, and you will be living with your local friends as a community, which gives you pride and strength. Please let me know if you are clear here as well.
17/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes now l have understood. Thank you very much sir.
17/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals. <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Alright sir l would like to ask if $550 is in addition to the $1125 on the on compus accomodation
17/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No, dear, it is solely meant for the tuition fees and is not in addition to the accommodation. May I know if you are clear here?
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 719 3568: So the $1125 stands alone in the accomadation
17/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. May I know if you have any concerns?
17/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 719 3568: For now l have no concerns.So far so good.Thank you very much sir
17/11/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes we are
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes sir  l would like that
17/11/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date). <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Sorry sir l did not understand what $150 grand is about
17/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please refer to this message so that you have a clear understanding about the grant.
17/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Alright l will check . So l will be paying $550 instead of $700 right?
17/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes l reside in Harare
17/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Thank you so much.This sounds so convenient sir
17/11/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes sir you can do so.
17/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
17/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details ?
17/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 719 3568: Yes sir l received the details. Thank you very much.
17/11/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 719 3568: No sir for now l do not have any querries
17/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -

The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.
