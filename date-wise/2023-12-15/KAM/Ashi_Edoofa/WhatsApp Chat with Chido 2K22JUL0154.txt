I hope you have taken note of our operational hours?
06/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I am a teacher here in Zimbabwe and those are the times we will also be at work. Can there be any flexibility in accommodating me  so as to have discussions when I have less pressure at work
06/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Or to have the discussions on Fridays afternoon including weekends, if possible
06/09/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that, and considering the fact that some parents may not be available during the day, so we have curated the time slots accordingly from 07.30 pm CAT to 10.30 pm CAT, please understand that India is 3.5 hours ahead of Zimbabwe, so considering the fact that parents will not be available to connect during the day, and since we want the best for you so that you do not miss out on the discussions we are operating late which is 11. 00 PM IST to 02.00 AM IST, and being available after 02.00 AM IST, will not be possible for us.

I hope you understand?

17/09/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Chido.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM. I understand that your schedules can be quite hectic, but I believe that dedicating just one hour of your time will be worthwhile. Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
18/09/23, 7:36 am - +263 77 314 5357: Noted with thanks
18/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Am available
18/09/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I still remember. We discussed stages 1 and 2 ( if not 3 again)
18/09/23, 5:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
18/09/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 314 5357: To be honest I can't recall  all we discussed. But if my memory serves me right, there is a registration fee required to facilitate the registration process
18/09/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 314 5357: It has been a very long time since we last had chats
18/09/23, 5:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are correct, Let me help you remember the registration process of the  Admission process in a short summary, may I know if you are available and ready to start with the discussion?
18/09/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Of course I am there
18/09/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. The registration process starts by explaining the primary focus of the admission process, which is centered around completing a scholarship application and sharing it with universities that align with the chosen course and are endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for higher education.
18/09/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Edoofa's team takes responsibility for submitting the application to multiple universities on behalf of the student. These universities then evaluate the student's eligibility and may offer a scholarship. If eligible, students receive an offer letter from the university. This offer letter contains detailed information, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. It provides a clear understanding of the annual educational expenses.
18/09/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students may receive multiple offer letters, but they can only choose one university. The decision should consider factors like exposure, ranking, affordability, and personal preferences. To secure the scholarship seat, students must pay a portion of their university fee, known as the registration fee. This fee typically ranges from $500 to $750. It confirms the reservation of the scholarship seat and allows students to finalize their registration. <This message was edited>
18/09/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Noted Ms Kirti
18/09/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, For students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, the registration fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it's considered a *component of their first-year tuition fee*. Students need to settle the registration fee while in their home country to secure their scholarship seat. The paid registration fee is adjusted within the first-year fee upon arrival in India, effectively reducing it to zero.
18/09/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Would be glad to learn more of what you have to share
18/09/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand the fee structure, including tuition, food, accommodation, and the registration fee with the help of an example:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum.
18/09/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now this registration fee of $750 will be adjusted to your first year's fee, leaving a balance of $2050 ($2800 - $750 = $2050). This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each which is August 2024 and January 2025, with the first initial installment due within three days of arrival in India. This payment plan offers flexibility, allowing students to manage their finances effectively and ensure timely payments before due dates.
18/09/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Apart from the registration fee, students also need to cover visa fees and flight expenses while still in their home country. Any other university-related fees can be paid after arriving in India. After paying the registration fee, students' EWYL credits become linked to their university's fee account. These credits can be used to offset annual university fees, reducing financial burdens as they progress through their education.
18/09/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon completing the registration fee payment, students receive an Admission Acceptance Letter. This document plays a crucial role in securing admission and facilitating the acquisition of a student visa.

Now, I hope you have understood and remembered what was discussed earlier during our counseling on admission process discussion, so may I know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
18/09/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I have a few questions.

- Does the scholarship fee vary from University to University?
- if my memory serves me right, I would like to believe that in the earlier discussions, fees vary from $750-1000 per semester. From your experience, what is the maximum % that Edoofa offers for scholarships?
-was  Chido's request to have the degree programme changed to a degree in Civil engineering taken into effect
07/10/23, 10:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
07/10/23, 10:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Chido.

I hope this message finds each of you in good health. I want to apologize for my recent absence and my inability to connect with you. I've been unwell, but I'm glad to report that I'm now on the path to recovery and looking forward to reconnecting with all of you. Are you currently available to connect with us?
07/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 314 5357: How are you? Being a teacher, we are having a consultation day with parents today. So it's a very hectic day
07/10/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing well.  I understand that being a teacher can be demanding, especially on days like consultation days when you're actively engaged with parents and students. In that case, may I know if you will be available to connect on Monday?
07/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Of course let's reconnect on Monday
07/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let us reconnect on Monday.
09/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Chido.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
09/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Good evening
09/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I am available
09/10/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now coming back to your query that I was unable to answer since I was ill, yes the fee varies in different universities. The $750 you are referring to is the registration fee which is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
09/10/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: And regarding your last query, yes course change is available with a detailed discussion, please.
09/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Ok noted
09/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 314 5357: We may proceed
09/10/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great so could you please let me know the reason behind the change of course why does Chido wish to change her course now, please?
09/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 314 5357: When she came for holidays last August, she said she had done research on what she aspires to do  hence her change of heart.
09/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 314 5357: So I respect her decision hence the request for programme change
09/10/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Sorry network is a bit slippery on this side but l hope we will manage to make progress
09/10/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand that network can be a challenge, however, I appreciate you supporting your daughter, could you also please share the subject combinations for her A- level?
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Pure Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry
09/10/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. In that case, please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti about changing your course from B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering) to B. Tech (civil engineering) for intake to 2024 and that you have finalized the same for yourself with your family supporting you. 

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail.
09/10/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 314 5357: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot with me. Now may I know if you are available to connect with us?
09/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 314 5357: My pleasure
09/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I am available
09/10/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Noted with thanks
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
09/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/10/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Yes it's not possible to study at multiple universities, meaning I will have to choose one.
09/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
09/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
09/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
09/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 314 5357: So does the scholarship amount vary with universities or edoofa offers the same across all universities? Of course I know fees vary with universities but what is the position as regards to the scholarship % component
09/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Yes we discussed about it
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you understand the fee does vary from university to university however, it is within the fee bracket that your counselor told you.
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Yes we are
09/10/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
09/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 314 5357: We are together
09/10/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 314 5357: But am sorry my gadget is running very very low on power
09/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand. May I know if you will be able to connect with us tomorrow at 12:30 pm?

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
10/10/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Chido, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Oooh. Amazing
10/10/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 314 5357: How exactly do l lock the fees structure
10/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773145357 let me help you understand, as mentioned above in Benefit one the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan, which means while we share your applications with the university for the year 2024 intake, you will be receiving the offer letter from the university within 3-5 days in the year 2023, according to the fee structure of the same year, and by reserving a seat with the university for your admission in 2024, you will be able to even lock the current fee structure.

I hope you are clear now?
10/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Clear now
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I don't know if I got you well. Upon receiving the offer letter, I am to pay $150
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 314 5357: As part of the registration fee. Is it
10/10/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773145357 the registration fee as discussed above in the example was $$750 from that one registration fee through the Endowment program Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf and you will only be required to pay $600 to reserve your seat with the University.
10/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Also, please understand that this registration fee of $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
10/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Now clear
10/10/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Clear
10/10/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I will be grateful if you provide more information
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
10/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I get you. Put in other words, does it imply that the more the points attained at A level, the higher the scholarship percentage?
10/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are absolutely correct. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
10/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 314 5357: True
10/10/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Agree
10/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Very clear
10/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Very clear Ms Kirti
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. 
Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Noted
10/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 314 5357: So far so good
10/10/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Chido's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Chido is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
10/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I am excited but is it possible to have the payment done at the end of the month when I have some earnings. Right now I don't have funds
10/10/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, as stated above after receiving the offer letter 15 days from that date you would have to make the first payment.  (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 11th of October, and so the first deadline becomes the 26th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 26th of November, 2023).

I hope we are clear?
10/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 314 5357: It's clear. But I would like to know the day you propose I get the offer letter so that the 15 days will lapse exactly  on the last day of October
10/10/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that @263773145357 however, please understand that the offer letters are generated by the university, and sometimes the university may take time to generate the letter, because of their schedules, so please it is not in our hands to let you know the exact proposed date, please. 

I hope you understand?
10/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Ok fine. I get you
10/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 314 5357: So is it possible that I get offer letters from more than one University?
10/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, it is certainly possible that you receive offer letter from more than one university.
10/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Ok. So this means I will have to wait maybe upto   13-14 days  from the day the first offer comes in the hope that another might come from a more reputable university is it? ( I said 13-14 days so that if I don't get another offer letter then payment will be done on the 15th day since it lies within the deadline)
10/10/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
10/10/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
10/10/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, Chido's application will be prepared and since we will share her application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from many universities. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So you have to be patient while the universities will evaluate her application. I hope we are together with this?
10/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Thanks for elaborating. Now very clear
10/10/23, 4:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now coming back to your query @263773145357 as you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by University B Chido would lose out on the scholarship from University B and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with such a situation, there is a transfer option available to the students. May I know if you are aware of that?
10/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I wasn't aware. Then in that case, it's super fine.
10/10/23, 5:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, @263773145357, that is the correct approach. To provide you with a better perspective on the transfer option: You can confidently reserve Chido's scholarship seat at University A by paying her registration fee without any worries or concerns.

In the future, if Chido receives a better scholarship offer and decides to change her university, she will have the opportunity to do so without incurring any additional costs.

Alternatively, if you receive another offer letter in the future and find that the University A offer is still the better choice, you can pursue her education there without losing the entire scholarship. This flexibility ensures that you can make the best decision for Chido's academic journey.
10/10/23, 5:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I hope you are clear now?
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Thank you for educating me on that
10/10/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. I hope all your queries have been answered now and you are looking forward to the offer letter for Chido?
10/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Of course. No queries for now
10/10/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take a week's time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 314 5357: My pleasure for the information
10/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Also enjoy your day
10/10/23, 5:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you so much have a great day to you too!
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chido.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive.

14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 314 5357: Oooh that's wonderful
14/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 314 5357: Will meet and share any questions I might have
14/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chido!

I wanted to ensure that you have a better understanding of the offer letter, and to allow for a more detailed discussion of your concerns, I'd like to reschedule our conversation for tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT. Please be prepared with any questions or concerns you may have, and we will address them during our discussion. Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow. Have a pleasant evening ahead.
14/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Thank you so much. I have great pleasure to inform you that tomorrow we will be attending a Prize Giving and Visiting Day at Chido' s school. She will be glad when I deliver the sweet news to her on the University offer letter. She will send you an audio through this phone.
15/10/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 314 5357: May you reschedule to 1030 I am driving to Chido's school
15/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 314 5357: Good morning
15/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chido!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 314 5357: Of course I read it
15/10/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 314 5357: Am ready
15/10/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 314 5357: We can discuss the contents of the letter
15/10/23, 10:59 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 314 5357: 1.  $1000
2.  4 years
3.  $300
4.  $750
15/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 314 5357: Hello I am there
15/10/23, 11:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across four years. This academic journey is divided into 8 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $1000 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $2000. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 314 5357: Of course
15/10/23, 11:26 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 11:26 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 11:26 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 314 5357: We are together
15/10/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 314 5357: We may proceed
15/10/23, 11:59 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Network seems to be a challenge over this side
15/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 314 5357: We are together
15/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Their move is commendable
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 5:52 am - +263 77 314 5357: Good morning. I am sorry I drove by night from Chido's school so I was very tired
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chido!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. I understand. May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here now?
16/10/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 314 5357: We may proceed now
16/10/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?

16/10/23, 2:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 2:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I stay in Rusape. If you can share with me your thoughts if I was a Harare resident
16/10/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Great.
16/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 314 5357: But before making payment I have a few questions
16/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 314 5357: 1. How is Galgotias University ranked in India and internationally? In other words, how marketable are their degrees?
2. Based on the 2023 intake, what is the average scholarship percentage of Zimbabwean students at the said  University who attained 6 points or better? If you could give information including the highest scholarship %
3. For those who opt for University accommodation, are they provided with linen and matress? 
4. For out of campus accommodation through the assistance of the University, do students commute or they live in the vicinity of the University campus which is walkable? In addition, how safe is it to live out of campus?
5. Then for the cooking facilities, what is provided? This is crucial for decision making.

I would be grateful if you respond to all the above questions for they enable me to make informed decisions.

18/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 314 5357: You can share the University insights
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

18/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 314 5357: As the download is ongoing, may I pose these questions I had asked earlier
18/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 314 5357: 1. How is Galgotias University ranked in India and internationally? In other words, how marketable are their degrees?
2. Based on the 2023 intake, what is the average scholarship percentage of Zimbabwean students at the said  University who attained 6 points or better? If you could give information including the highest scholarship %

18/10/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 314 5357: All downloads complete. Thanks for sharing the information
19/10/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chido!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 10:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your questions. I'm glad to hear that the downloads are complete, and I'm here to provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision. Let's go through your questions one by one:

*1. University Rankings and Degree Marketability*: Galgotias University is ranked in the top 100 universities in India as I had already shared above and I can tell you that Indian universities are recognized worldwide, and degrees from reputable Indian institutions such as Galgotias are marketable globally. 

*2. Scholarship Information*: When it comes to the scholarship percentage it is evaluated by the university itself, however for the Edoofians, the guaranteed scholarship percentage stays to be 50% please. 

*3. University Accommodation*: Yes, the university provides essential amenities like linen and mattresses for students opting for on-campus accommodation. They aim to ensure a comfortable living environment for their students.
19/10/23, 10:45 am - Milan Edoofa: *4. Off-Campus Accommodation*: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please. 

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students.
19/10/23, 10:47 am - Milan Edoofa: *5. Cooking Facilities*: The specific cooking facilities may vary based on the type of accommodation you choose, whether it's on-campus or off-campus. For instance, if you would choose on-campus accommodation, then there would be no need for the same, since the food will be provided from the side of the university officials. Moving ahead, when it comes to off-campus accommodation, all the students staying together would have to arrange the cooking utilities by themselves.
19/10/23, 10:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, with this, I hope all the queries that you had are clear, right?
19/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Am now clear
19/10/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
19/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Yes we did. I even had the opportunity to pass the information to Chido on Sunday since I attended prize giving day and visit at her school. She is now busy with her final exams which started on Tuesday this week
19/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 314 5357: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. I am glad to see that Chido is so happy, right! Moving ahead, may I know were you also able to discuss the offer letter as a family?
19/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Yes we did
19/10/23, 9:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
19/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 314 5357: The family conversation went on nicely. As a family, we had the following wishes:
-that Chido passes her   exams convincingly so as to further raise the scholarship percentage from 50% thus removing the financial burden
-that we at least get 2 more offers from other renowned Indian universities for it will position us better to make comparisons pertaining scholarship percentages and rankings of universities 
-that Chido will play her part through EWYL thus easing the financial burden on us the parents
-that Chido secures good out of campus accommodation within the vicinity of the University
19/10/23, 11:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, regarding point number 1 and 3 here, I would like to mention that I am sure Chido will make sure to do that. Now, moving ahead, when it comes to point number 4, stay assured that here at Edoofa, we will help her with that and she will not have any issues with the same.
19/10/23, 11:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if we can discuss about point 2 now?
20/10/23, 5:58 am - +263 77 314 5357: Great to learn of that on that assurance of point number 4
20/10/23, 5:59 am - +263 77 314 5357: I am sorry I suddenly fell asleep during the course of the conversation.

Good morning

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
21/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 314 5357: [10/19, 21:21] Farai: The family conversation went on nicely. As a family, we had the following wishes:
-that Chido passes her   exams convincingly so as to further raise the scholarship percentage from 50% thus removing the financial burden
-that we at least get 2 more offers from other renowned Indian universities for it will position us better to make comparisons pertaining scholarship percentages and rankings of universities 
-that Chido will play her part through EWYL thus easing the financial burden on us the parents
-that Chido secures good out of campus accommodation within the vicinity of the University
[10/19, 23:04] +91 95407 16843: Now, may I know if we can discuss about point 2 now?
21/10/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
21/10/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 314 5357: We were about to discuss point 2 above
21/10/23, 11:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is what I am helping you in understanding here. For that, may I know if you are clear til here please?
21/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 314 5357: Network very slippery over this side
21/10/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright, please. I understand that. However, if I may ask, are you clear till here please?
21/10/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I am clear
21/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Everything is clear
21/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 314 5357: So far so good
21/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Everything is crystal clear
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and chido!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know that you are clear till that point. Nov, moving ahead, let us proceed with our conversation about that. So, As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
23/10/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 314 5357: Very clear
23/10/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
23/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Of course you explained that to me
23/10/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Are you sure that you are aware of the same, because I believe we did not have any conversation with each other here about that.
23/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 314 5357: So I got the information from Ms Kirti
23/10/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Oh, I am glad to hear that please. Now, Let me help you in recalling about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
23/10/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
23/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Very clear indeed
23/10/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, on that note, I believe you are clear about the same now, right?
23/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Very much indeed
23/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, moving ahead, if I may ask do you have any other queries that you would like to ask regarding the offer letter?
23/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 314 5357: So far so good
23/10/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
23/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I am still in the process of learning about the University
23/10/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.

Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
23/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I will pay through 2 instalments
23/10/23, 2:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
23/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I am going to pay this Wednesday through Mr Rajan
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 314 5357: [10/23, 14:41] Farai: Greetings Sir. I intend to make the  transfer this Wednesday thru Mukuru. May I have your details so that I can be able to send the money

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.

14/12/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
14/12/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
