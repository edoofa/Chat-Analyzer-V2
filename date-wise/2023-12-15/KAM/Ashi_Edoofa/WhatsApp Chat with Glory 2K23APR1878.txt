I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

10/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet
10/10/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
10/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Am doing well and you
10/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 434 0441: I am available now
10/10/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/10/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
10/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Yes sir we are
10/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
10/10/23, 4:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 434 0441: It is indeed our joy to see ourselves hearing towards such an important achievement

10/10/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/10/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/10/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Noted
10/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Let's proceed
10/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
10/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Noted
10/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Yes
10/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Yes sir
10/10/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 71 434 0441: I am following Sir
10/10/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Kindly provide more information sir
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 434 0441: I get it, that's wonderful
10/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 434 0441: My apologies, for now l am about finishing work and preparing to go home , can take a break
10/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Can we take a break Sir
10/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes Indeed. Please let me know when you are available.
10/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Thank you for understanding
11/10/23, 4:10 am - +263 71 434 0441: Am available now
11/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet, l am now available
11/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
11/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 434 0441: I am sorry Sir it's not clear, l need a bit of clarity on this
11/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
11/10/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Yes it's clear
11/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
11/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Very clear
11/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 71 434 0441: There are no queries instead it has been made very much clearer, let's move forward
11/10/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Glory's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Glory is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
11/10/23, 6:36 pm - +263 71 434 0441: I can't wait to grab this opportunity we are indeed waiting for this Sir
11/10/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Glory's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
11/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Thank you so much, we will happily wait to hear from you
11/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
11/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Thank you
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Glory.

15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that. However, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now?
15/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Yes l did
15/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Getwell soon
15/10/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for the wish ☺️! Moving ahead, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
16/10/23, 5:53 am - +263 71 434 0441: 1. 900, 2. Three years, 3. 300, 4. 750
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Glory!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
16/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Good morning
16/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Yes it's clear and straight forward
16/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 434 0441: I am available now if you are free may we please continue
17/10/23, 1:09 am - +263 71 434 0441: Following
17/10/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Glory!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
17/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Good afternoon Yes we are together
17/10/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
17/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Yes let's move on
17/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 434 0441: It's clear
17/10/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
17/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Surely this is good, so when is this $750 due
17/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Is there any payment plan to settle this amount
18/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 71 434 0441: Good morning, l am available now
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gory!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Thank you for the clarification, we are moving together
18/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 71 434 0441: On the same note , can you please tell me how to send the money which Bank here in Zimbabwe will l use to send,  yes I saw your bank details
18/10/23, 1:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 1:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Yes I reside in Harare
19/10/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Glory!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Okay thanks
19/10/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

19/10/23, 9:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

20/10/23, 9:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require.

20/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 434 0441: We can proceed
20/10/23, 9:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Thank you so much for the support and guidance, about any further research about the university, l have not been able to, because of the tight schedule that I have at work
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I would advise you to do that! As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.

Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
20/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 434 0441: Yes I am considering to have a single payment of $600 if funds permit

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

Firstly, I am delighted to inform you that the payment you have made for the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly in order to ensure a seamless transition in your application process. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 5:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
14/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
