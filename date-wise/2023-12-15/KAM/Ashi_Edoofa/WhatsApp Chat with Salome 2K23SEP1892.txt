26/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
26/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes , very clear indeed.
26/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 718 4357: We can proceed.
26/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
26/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
26/09/23, 10:51 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes yes lm am following my pologies for replying a bit late .
27/09/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Salome.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
27/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Good evening.We are fine thank you and how are you.My apologies for yesterday my network was tripping.I am now available,yes we can proceed.
27/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes , all is clear.l understand all the six steps.
27/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/09/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes ,we may start.
27/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

29/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Good evening everyone.Yes l watched the videos yes we may proceed.
29/09/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to see that. So may I know if you might be able to give me a brief understanding about the four videos with me?
29/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity to explain what l understood by viewing the four vedios. On the first vedio l understood about Edoofa program which is interested in enrolling students that are willing to go an extra mile and who are open minded .In the second video l got a lot of insight about Edoofa 's vision ,plans ,wishes and expectations for students that are enrolled. l clearly remember that Edoofa wants students that follow Edoofa instructions and coachable so that will earn Schoolarship credits.ln the third video it mentioned about the schools and colleges and also universities that Were invested in by Edoofa and that as students we are expected to passionate and have the spirit of independence as it is taking a big step of being successful.The fourth video l got to understand about the statement of purpose that it's important document and student is supposed to fill the form.
29/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
29/09/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes sir ,we are on the same page.We can move on to the second step.
29/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
29/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tuesday 5:30 PM.
29/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

29/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 718 4357: It's alright sir.l will be available and prepared for the next session.Have a great night .
29/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that we shall connect at the said time. Have a great weekend and my warm regards to your family as well.
03/10/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Good Evening.Hope you had a great holiday.
03/10/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 718 4357: May you kindly advise if l should I start answering the questions?
03/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process.
03/10/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes please, dear. I am currently waiting for the same.
03/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Okay noted
03/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Question 1.Give a brief introduction, highlighting your skills with an example.(audio form 2-5 minutes)
03/10/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 718 4357: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Q.2 Is there such a thing as a social structure that constrains individual action,or  is society nothing more than a figment of our imagrations?
03/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 718 4357: I agree that there is such a thing as social structure that constraints individual actions.Some sociologists argue that society is a real, concrete thing that imposes limits on individuals and shapes their behavior. On the other hand, other sociologists argue that society is nothing more than a set of ideas and beliefs that we collectively create and maintain. The sociologist Pierre Bourdieu is a big proponent of this idea. He argues that our actions are influenced by the social structures we're born into and the resources we have access to. So, for example, someone born into a lower socioeconomic class may have less access to education and job opportunities, which limits their ability to act in a certain way.Society is largely made up of ideas and beliefs, rather than physical things. For example, the idea of "money" is something we all collectively agree on and believe in, even though it's not a physical object. But even though society is made up of ideas, it does have a real impact on our lives.  For example, laws are a social construct, but they still have very real consequences for individuals who break them.  So, even if society is not a physical thing, it does affect our lives in very tangible ways.
03/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Q.3The relationship between sociology and economics .
03/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Sociology and economics are closely related disciplines, as they both focus on understanding human behavior and interactions.  Economics focuses more specifically on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, while sociology takes a broader view and looks at all aspects of social life, including the economy.  Both disciplines use similar research methods and theories to understand human behavior, such as the theory of rational choice and the social construction of reality.  In fact, many sociologists and economists work together to study the social and economic issues that affect society.
03/10/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Q.4 What is the role of institutions in society -do they perform positive functions,or simply work in the intrests of the powerful and against the powerless? Elaborate with example.
03/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Institutions do perform positive functions in society as they are a part of the social order of society.They govern behaviour and expectations of individuals, maintain order and stability, facilitating economic growth and promoting social cohesion.While   at the same time they regulate business operations and ethics. In fact, the morality of institutions is guaranteed by the process of social evolution. On the other hand, the role of business in society is an important aspect of leadership and not in conflict with profitability and economic growth.The institution of marriage for example is seen as a stabilizing force that helps to regulate sexual activity and reproduction and provide a secure environment for raising children. Another example would be the institution of education.  From a functionalist perspective, education is seen as serving a number of positive functions, such as socializing children into society's norms and values, providing training for future employment, and increasing social mobility. While there are benefits to education, it can also be seen as a way to maintain the status quo and reinforce inequalities.  For example, those with higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes and better job opportunities, and education can also perpetuate social divisions based on class, race, and gender.
03/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 718 4357: 5.Explain primary and secondary groups as the two sociological groups and elaborate with examples about in the groups and out groups as subtypes of primary and secondary groups
03/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Social groups consist of two or more people who regularly interact and share a sense of unity and common identity. They see each other often and consider themselves as part of the group. Most people belong to many different types of social groups. They could include family, neighbors, or members of a sports team, a club, a church, a college class, or a workplace. What social scientists are interested in is how the members of these groups relate and interact.
Early American sociologist Charles Horton Cooley introduced the concepts of primary and secondary groups in his 1909 book "Social Organization: A Study of the Larger Mind." Cooley was interested in how people develop a sense of self and identity through their relationships and interactions with others. In his research, Cooley identified two levels of social organization that are composed of two different kinds of social structure.


Primary groups are small and characterized by close, personal, and intimate relationships that last a long time, maybe a lifetime. These relationships are deeply personal and loaded with emotion. The members typically include family, childhood friends, romantic partners, and members of religious groups who have regular face-to-face or verbal interaction and a shared culture and frequently engage in activities together.

Secondary groups comprise relatively impersonal and temporary relationships that are goal- or task-oriented and are often found in employment or educational settings. While the relationships within primary groups are intimate, personal, and enduring, the relationships within secondary groups are organized around narrow ranges of practical interests or goals without which these groups would not exist. Secondary groups are functional groups created to carry out a task or achieve a goal.

Typically a person becomes a member of a secondary group voluntarily, out of shared interest with the others involved. Common examples include coworkers in an employment setting or students, teachers, and administrators in an educational setting. Such groups can be large or small, ranging from all the employees or students within an organization to the select few who work together on a project. Small secondary groups such as these often disband after completion of the task or project.

A secondary group does not exercise a primary influence over its members because they do not live in the presence and thoughts of one another. The average member plays a passive role, and the warmth of the relationships in primary groups is missing


An important distinction between secondary and primary groups is that the former often have an organized structure, formal rules, and an authority figure who oversees the rules, members, and the project or task in which the group is involved. Primary groups, on the other hand, are typically informally organized, and the rules are more likely to be implicit and transmitted through socialization.
03/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the academic answers. May I know if you were able to fill out the online SOP form as well.
03/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 718 4357: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes l was able to fill out the Edoofa Statement of Purpose.
03/10/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Sociology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
03/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 718 4357: You are welcome sir .Yes indeed the information is accurate.
03/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
03/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes, lm ready.We can proceed.
03/10/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
03/10/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
03/10/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
03/10/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
03/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Wow, yes you are right it is possible for sure for a student to study at multiple universities and l hope l will receive multiple offer letters.l appreciate your help as you promise to submit my application to various universities.
03/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct an d we will be there to guide you through the process. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
03/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
03/10/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
03/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes ,he told me.Thank you for the information shared.
04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Good Afternoon, thank you for the motivation quote.Yes, l am currently available to proceed.
04/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/10/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes l understand that.
04/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
04/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
04/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
04/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes indeed , thank you for explaining.
04/10/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
04/10/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
04/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Ok noted.
04/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 718 4357: May l kindly know if l can be given a timeframe to gather the $750 after receiving an offer letter.
04/10/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, I understand the financial planning involved. After receiving the offer letter, you will be provided with a specific timeframe within which you should aim to pay the $750 registration fee. This timeframe is usually set to ensure that the admission process and seat reservation move forward smoothly.
04/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Okay thank you.
04/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India. <This message was edited>
04/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
04/10/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
04/10/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 264 4069: Thank you, l am sorry kindly not l am facing network problems with my phone at the moment. I don't have queries, but l only wanted to know the approximate months that universities can give to gather the registration fee so that we will be prepared because lm hoping not to loose this opportunity.
04/10/23, 11:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
09/10/23, 3:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
09/10/23, 3:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?

09/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Ok noted with thanks.
09/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 718 4357: We really appreciate all these benefits of Endowment Program.
09/10/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Blessing, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing her seat before the competition even begins. She will be the trailblazer among her peers, firmly positioning her as a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Ok sir l understand, the benefits are really overwhelming.
09/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 718 4357: That's wonderful and lm very thankful for your decision to create this beneficial strategy for us students.
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes indeed thank you for clarifying.
09/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Wow,this is great news.Yes you have explained clearly.
09/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 718 4357: No l have understood everything is clear,thank you.
09/10/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted

09/10/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 718 4357: We can move forward sir .l don't have any queries
09/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are  among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?

15/10/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 718 4357: We are available*
15/10/23, 10:59 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 718 4357: 1.tution fee per semester after schoolarship is 900 .
15/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 718 4357: 2.The standard duration of course is three years.
15/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 718 4357: The Admission and Procedure Fee is 300
15/10/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 718 4357: 4.Registration fee is $750
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Good evening sir.Yes it is clear.
15/10/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Alright thank you,l think Off campus accommodation is more affordable and l would prefer it.
15/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 718 4357: That's good to hear .Yes ,we are together.
15/10/23, 9:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes it's very clear we can move forward.
15/10/23, 10:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
15/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes we are together.
15/10/23, 10:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 10:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 10:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes it's clear but we are supposed to pay the remaining $ 150 for last month registration fee before 26 October.Kindly please give us some few more days like before 5 November we would gather the $300.
15/10/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, are you finding it challenging to pay the fee by 28th October please?
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes ,it's a bit challenging,may you kindly push the dates a bit if it's possible .
15/10/23, 10:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I believe you are ready to pay teh $150 balance enrollment before 26th October, right?
15/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes
15/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: And by then, how much do you think you would be able to raise towards the registration fee as well?
15/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 718 4357: I think $100
15/10/23, 10:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: This means, that in total, you would be able to raise $250 by then, is that so?
15/10/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes
15/10/23, 10:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, what we will do is that you can pay the total amount of $250 or preferably $300 if you manage to raise that by then before the deadline and we will get it adjusted in Salome's registration. Moving ahead, you can then pay the $150 balance by 05th November, I believe this would be helpful for you, right?
15/10/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes thank you .We really appreciate your help.With the help of my parents will try to look for money to make it $300 this month.
15/10/23, 10:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/10/23, 10:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/10/23, 10:44 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes ,we are in Harare
15/10/23, 10:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/10/23, 10:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/10/23, 10:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/10/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 718 4357: This is an awesome idea . Thank you so much.We will definitely get in touch with him
15/10/23, 10:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
15/10/23, 10:53 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Ok ,it's alright you can share the details.
15/10/23, 10:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
15/10/23, 10:56 pm - +263 77 718 4357: We will decide and inform you.
15/10/23, 11:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
15/10/23, 11:03 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Noted with thanks.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Salome!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

16/10/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrowand also discuss the way forward for your admission process.

17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Salome!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
17/10/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Good morning.We are fine thanks and how are you?Yes, we discussed about the offer letter.We just wanted to ask if the off campus is safe for me as a student.Will there be specific residential places for students?
17/10/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the assurance that you needed, right?
17/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Okay that's great,what about the rentals approximately what is the monthly payment?
17/10/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that the safety measures in place are reassuring for you. When it comes to the monthly rent, the cost for off-campus accommodations typically ranges between $35 to $45 per month. This can vary depending on the type of housing you choose and whether you opt for a single or shared room.

In addition to rent, you should also consider the cost of food. On average, the monthly expenses for food can be approximately $20 to $25 per month. This includes groceries as well as occasional meals outside. I hope this is clear?
17/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Very clear indeed thank you
17/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 718 4357: We wanted to understand about data,is there WiFi or will also have to buy data bundles for better network connection.
17/10/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: You're welcome, and I'm glad it's clear to you. Regarding the internet connection, the off-campus accommodations recommended for students often come with WiFi facilities included in the rent. This means that you will have access to a WiFi network in your accommodation, and you won't need to buy separate data bundles for your internet connection.

Apart from that when it comes to Mobile Data Packs as well, it is very cheap here in India. An unlimited internet and calling pack for a whole year is only around $18-20 please.
17/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 264 4069: That's good to hear
17/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 718 4357: This is very great news.Thank you so much for the information.We don't have further questions
17/10/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
17/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 718 4357: It's alright.Yes you can ask .
17/10/23, 4:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Salome, I was asking that if you have any further queries or concerns that you wish to share?
17/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 264 4069: I  wanted to ask weather, if it means students will be it same compus .mixing girls and boys, 
Do you have tight security regarding safety of children
17/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 264 4069: I'm am sorry to ask this, but as a parent, we will be very far away, thats why we are concerned
17/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 264 4069: Sometimes children misbehave especially to foreigners, and they will be left with no choice
18/10/23, 7:25 am - +263 77 718 4357: Good morning, kindly note today l will be writing my second final mathematics paper 2 from 9am to 11:30 am .

Moving ahead, when it comes to the concern that you have regarding the safety and security of the students, you can stay assured of the same since the university officials along with their security team are on watch 24x7 inside the campus and make sure that no nuisance or any other indisciplinary activities are not carried out anywhere please.

18/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Yes very clear indeed thank you.

18/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 718 4357: No we don't have any questions
18/10/23, 1:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively.

18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, you can do that later and if you have any queries to discuss, you can then let me know.
18/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
18/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 718 4357: Okay
18/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 718 4357: We will try to gather $300 first then pay another the following month
18/10/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
18/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 718 4357: I think Monday 23 October
