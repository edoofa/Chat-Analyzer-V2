For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.
01/09/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes please

01/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 71 137 5137: I have gone through it
01/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes they are clear
01/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes l am following
01/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Well noted
01/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes it is well clear
01/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
01/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 71 137 5137: At stage 5, the registration fee is paid all at once and will it be part of the fees?
01/09/23, 10:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
01/09/23, 10:42 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes we are..it is well understood
02/09/23, 10:07 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Bubelihle. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

05/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 137 5137: And students should keep in mind that in Edoofa its not all about just a scholarship, but also the amount of success that comes with it .
05/09/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
05/09/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
05/09/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
05/09/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
05/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 214 7891: Yes, we are on the same page
05/09/23, 3:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, . Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
05/09/23, 3:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job.

Geography and economy are interconnected through the study of the environment which has the natural resources to the transportation systems which are needed for economic growth.  Geographers, as they work and study the environment and its surroundings, through looking at the factors like climate, demographics, politics, infrastructure and transport, as well as ither contributing factors to the development of the country's economy.
Zimbabwe has strong foundation for accelerating future economic growth and improving the country's living standards.  The country has good human capital as compared to countries in the upper middle income economies of the sub Sahara in Africa. The economy in Zimbabwe, continues to be shackled by price and exchange rate instability, misallocation  of productive resources, high informality, low investment and limited structural transformation, hence the growth has been hindered over the past few years. Inflation  is increasing as well as unsustainable debt levels and the cost of production has also increased. 
According to the World bank, GDP growth in Zimbabwe is estimated to have decreased to 3.4% in 2022 from 8.5% in the previous year, thus worsening agricultural conditions and instability of macroeconomics.  Also due to unfavourable weather conditions and constant changes in climate, agricultural output has contracted by 14% as stated by the world bank. On the other hand, mineral exporters, have benefited from high global prices , contributing to the growth of economy.
The transport and infrastructure sector has also weakened with most roads and infrastructure damaged for example the Nkayi road, which is not in a good condition, however other parts of the transport and infrastructure sector are in good position .

Geographers, through studies of climatology, which is an influencing factor in the growth of Zimbabwe economy that relies mainly on agricultural activities.  It is important to study climatic conditions as they help in planning for agricultural seasons, as extreme weather conditions like hurricane, floods, drought can disrupt economic growth and also trigger significant losses. As agricultural sector is mainly dependant on climate, it is crucial for weather patterns to be studied and put into use so regions that are prone to droughts can grow drought resistant crops as to prevent low crop yields which lead to shortages of food and increase in food prices as well as fuel.
Studies in demographics, such as population studies, age-sex pyramid structures, settlements, also play a role in economic development,  for example if Zimbabwe has more of dependable population and low /few economical active population , the economy is bound to be weak due to shrinking work force and more of increased health care costs this hindering growth and attracting little investment into the country. 
Also, through geographers studying politics and governance , it helps grows the economy through helping in maintaining stable government, predictable policies and low corrupt officials, this helping the economy to have a competitive advantage in attracting foreign investment and promoting growth.
Hence, in conclusion, geography plays a crucial role in promoting growth of economy as it looks at different factors which include physical( climate), human ( political) and other factors at large.

Human- environment interaction shows how the society and environment behave towards one another, as humans depend on, adapt and modify the environment through deforestation, energy resources, water usage, waste, pollution and urban expansion.  The environment consists of our physical surroundings and the characteristics of the place in which human live be it land, water or the atmosphere.  This essay will highlight how the environment influences humans as well as ways which human affect the environment. 
Deforestation shows how human/ society depends on, adapts and modify the environment.  Deforestation occurs when forestry is cleared and trees are no longer replanted or allowed to regrow due to clearance of land for agriculture, mining activities or for building  purposes.  Deforestation has a negative impact on the environment as it leads to soil erosion because the underlying ground will be exposed as there wont be any vegetation that binds the soil together.  However planting of trees, helps in binding the soil together as tree roots reach deep into the soil, and create pores between soil particles which increase soil permeability, allowing water to infiltrate and recharge ground water shortages. 
The use of renewable and non- renewable resources is also a factor in the human- environment interaction. Fossil fuels have led to global industrialisation which has caused global warming and climate change. This has led to melting of ice caps, rises in sea levels  and constant changes in weather patterns that are unfavourable.  Due to fossil fuels being non renewable, their usage is not sustainable. The use of renewable resources by human kind, like solar has caused a positive impact on the environment due to it being toxic substance free, as solar uses photovoltaic cells to convert the energy from the sun into electricity. 
Urban expansion is occurring as the population of the world is increasing on daily basis.  This has led to cutting down of trees, to create space for housing and it has also led to modifying of the natural environment to sustain the growing population. The modifying of the land has led to habitat loss of animals.
Water, which is a natural resource that humans highly depend . It is essential for human survival. It is used by humans for various reasons , however it has been modified as to increase human access to it. The increasing dependency on water has led to water scarcity in societies, this creating health issues , economic constraints as well as causing the environment to undergo droughts, having a negative effect on the environment. 
Waste is an inevitable product human environmental interactions, as it increases along with world's population.  It is produced by humans and deposited in the natural environment by humans, thus modifying the environment during waste disposal.
In conclusion; human- environmental interaction is significant as the environment is crucial to human survival due to the natural resources that exist within the environment, thus the relationship between humans and the environment should be positive, and this can be maintained through sustainability of resources.

It is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking and displaying data related information to position on earth's surface, it shows different kind of data on one map such as streets, buildings, and vegetation, enabling people to observe, analyse and understand patterns in an easily manner.
GIS is a crucial part of spatial data infrastructure as it consists of activities necessary to acquire, process, distribute, use, maintain and preserve spatial data. 
Is it important as it can compare and contrast different types of information about people such as population, income or education level. The use of GIS, helps people to compare the location of different things in order to discover how they relate to each other. 
GIS  captures data, using applications which include cartographic data, photographic data and digital data. Cartographic data is in map form and they include information such as location of rivers, roads, hills and valleys, as well as survey and mapping data that can be directly entered into GIS. Photographic data, is a major part of GIS, as it involves analysis of aerial photographs and assessing features that are appearing.  Digital data is information which is collected by satellites that shows land use.
GIS also include data such as population demographics which range from age, income, ethnicities and internet browsing .
GIS  is important as it helps manipulate data due to different maps having different projections that accomplish this task in different ways but all resulting in same distortion. It also helps in planning and providing a platform to store and analyse large amounts of data as it enables the make of informed decisions. 
GIS is an essential tool in emergency response and disaster management by providing real time information about the location and extent of the disaster. It can also help first responders to quickly assess the situation and make informed decisions. 
In conclusion, GIS enables people to store, manage and analyse geospatial data as it provides us with much better understanding of the patterns and relationships that exist in the world around us.

Places are connected with one another as the earth once consisted of one continent before splitting due to plate movements, this is evident with border patterns that lie continents. Also another evidence is the animal and plant species that exist in South of Africa are similar to those found in south of South America.  
Places are also connected with one another through physical characteristics of the place that make up its natural environment and are derived from geological, hydrological, atmospheric and biological processes, which include bodies of Water, soils, natural vegetation, landforms, for example Zimbabwe and Zambia are connected because of Zambezi River.
Agricultural regions, also contribute to the factors of why are places connected with one another.  As places which share the same region are bound to be connected due the physical or human characteristics that found in that area for example  in Zimbabwe, places which fall under natural region 5 are connected due to experiencing low rainfall and prone to droughts.
In conclusion,physical and human characteristics of a place provide key points of interrelations of places, people and the environment; and the position of the earth surface and how people are distributed and located in relations to site, latitude and longitude of the places.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Geography) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
07/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes l have selected BA(Geography)
07/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
07/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes l am
07/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
07/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
07/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
07/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
07/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes lm aware of it and l total agree no student can study at various universities
07/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Well noted .
07/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 71 137 5137: If a student ends up being accepted at various universities, he or she is assisted to choose one by Edoofa?
07/09/23, 10:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it has been a long day for me, and our available hours are coming to an end, I would like to reconnect tomorrow and continue with our session. I hope you have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

07/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Thank you very much
08/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Bubelihle, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
08/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 214 7891: Good Afternoon
We are available

We can begin
08/09/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings! I hope you're enjoying this beautiful evening. Kindly excuse me for the late reply. May I know if you are available to proceed with the session?
08/09/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Good evening, yes we are  available.
08/09/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am now continuing with the session.
08/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, certainly we will assist the student in guiding the right offer letter as per his/her preference. May I know if you are clear here?
08/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes l am.
08/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
08/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
08/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
08/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes it was discussed.
08/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/09/23, 7:04 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Good evening
11/09/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Bubelihle.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you on time.

Please let me know if you are available so we can proceed further with our session?
11/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Good evening, yes we are available.
11/09/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
11/09/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
11/09/23, 10:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
12/09/23, 6:34 am - +263 71 137 5137: Yes l  have taken note of the example
12/09/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Bubelihle

Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Bubelihle EWYL23E0614*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/GnHmdG1F31yKUnbWyRbd1y"
12/09/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Bubelihle Dube and my EWYL group name is Bubelihle EWYL23E0614.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
12/09/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
12/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Good afternoon. Well noted and thank you
12/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Hello Admission officer, l have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms Aditi.
12/09/23, 2:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the name of your mentor. May I know if you re ready to proceed with the session
12/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes, l am.
12/09/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/09/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
12/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Well noted.
12/09/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/09/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/09/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/09/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 137 5137: No we may continue
12/09/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
12/09/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session Tomorrow at 01:00 pm to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
12/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Well noted
12/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes we will be connected
13/09/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Good afternoon.
13/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Sorry to connect late.
13/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 214 7891: Good Afternoon
13/09/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Bubelihle, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
13/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes we may begin.
13/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 214 7891: Good Afternoon
13/09/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
13/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 137 5137: No lm not fully aware of it.
13/09/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
13/09/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Bubelihle, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
13/09/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
13/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Well noted and understood.
13/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Good evening
13/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
13/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes, please.
13/09/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
13/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 137 5137: No I wasn't.
13/09/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
13/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
13/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes l have gone through the benefits.
13/09/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
13/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
13/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes, it's well noted.
13/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.
13/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.
13/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
13/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes, we on the the same page.
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
13/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Well noted.
13/09/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving an option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 30th September 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 30th September 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 30th October 2023. Any queries so far?
13/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 137 5137: There aint any, cause l got to understand that even if the student doesnt not have the whole 600$ at once they are allowed to be given a grace period.
13/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct. Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
13/09/23, 10:11 pm - +263 71 137 5137: All points have been well noted and understood.
13/09/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. Hence, I shall conclude our session for now and we shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM for further continuation of our session.
13/09/23, 10:13 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Okay, thank you.We will be connected.
14/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Bubelihle. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Good evening. I'm doing okay, thank you.
14/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Bubelihle, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
14/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes we did discuss about the advantages of early decision.
14/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 71 214 7891: Good Afternoon
We are all fine...
14/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
14/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes they are connected.  They will like to know, if the early scholarship grant does if mean that the student gets to complete their admission formalities by January or the seat will be preserved for August intake ?
14/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. If you have paid for the fees the seat is reserved for you under your name until your intake starts. May I know if we are on the same page here?
14/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes we are.
14/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
14/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes, they are prepared and are willing to assist all the way.
14/09/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
14/09/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
14/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes, we on the same page, l do recall .
14/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Well noted.
14/09/23, 10:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
14/09/23, 10:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
14/09/23, 10:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
14/09/23, 10:40 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes, it is well understood.
14/09/23, 10:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/09/23, 10:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
14/09/23, 10:41 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes we may.
14/09/23, 10:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 18th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 3rd of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
14/09/23, 10:43 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes l understood the process.
14/09/23, 10:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
14/09/23, 10:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
14/09/23, 10:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 18th of September, the deadline becomes the 3rd of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 18th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 3rd of October 2023, making the second deadline the 3rd of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes , well noted.
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
14/09/23, 10:52 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes, they were well explained.
14/09/23, 10:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
14/09/23, 11:10 pm - +263 71 137 5137: According to my understanding, the admission process only happens / begins when the parents of the student give their consent. The admission happens in standard registration and early registration.  The standard registration is set with standard procedures, once the students get an offer letter, a payment of about 500$-750$  is paid to completely the registration within a period of 15 days and the universities are strict when it comes to preserving the seats as many students would have applied.
14/09/23, 11:10 pm - +263 71 137 5137: The second process , is the early decision, which has 6 benefits. Edoofa gets to pay $150 of the amount (750$), the student gets to pay the remaining amount either at once or in two parts. The first part is paid within a period of 15days  and the remaining amount is paid after 30days
14/09/23, 11:10 pm - +263 71 137 5137: And it is crucial for the student to meet the deadlines set by the university
14/09/23, 11:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
14/09/23, 11:25 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes, we are clear.
14/09/23, 11:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
14/09/23, 11:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *3rd October* and *3rd November*.
14/09/23, 11:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *3rd October* and *3rd November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Bubelihle’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
14/09/23, 11:35 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes you may proceed with the application for early decision .Everything has been fully understood and well noted.
14/09/23, 11:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know if your parents are available to give us the official go ahead. <This message was edited>
14/09/23, 11:39 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes they are.
14/09/23, 11:41 pm - +263 71 214 7891: Good evening, you may proceed with the application for early decision.
14/09/23, 11:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Bubelihle’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *3rd October* and *3rd November*.)  and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
14/09/23, 11:48 pm - +263 71 214 7891: Yes we are ready to support.
14/09/23, 11:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Bubelihle’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Bubelihle’s higher education well.
14/09/23, 11:51 pm - +263 71 214 7891: For now we do not have any queries as you highlighted everything well and we were able to understand how the process works
14/09/23, 11:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
14/09/23, 11:54 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Well noted and thank you.

3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
20/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 71 137 5137: 1. 1165$
2. 1250$
3. 750$
21/09/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bubelihle!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting that came up. Now, I appreciate your patience here and let us move ahead with our discussion here.
21/09/23, 10:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1165 and your per annum accommodation fee is $1250 which makes your per annum educational fee $1165 +$1250 = $2415. I hope you are clear about this?
21/09/23, 10:45 am - +263 71 137 5137: Good morning
21/09/23, 10:45 am - +263 71 137 5137: Yes , we on the same page.
21/09/23, 10:58 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now when we talk about accommodation at PDM University, for the first year, it is recommended that the students opt for the on-campus hostel as they are new to the place and the university is in a better position to assist them with their FRRO.

From the second year, when they are familiar with the place and have made a few friends if they wish, they can move out of the on-campus accommodation and look for accommodation options outside the university campus.
21/09/23, 10:59 am - Milan Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, your accommodation fee would be $1000 per annum and will have to be paid to the landlord of the place you stay. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70 and the cost of food would be $20 to $30. 

This means, with the off-campus accommodation, your per annum cost would reduce to ($1165 + $1000) = $2165. Are you clear with this as well?
21/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 137 5137: What does FRRO mean?
21/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 137 5137: Yes l am
21/09/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure-

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
21/09/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 137 5137: Okay, well noted
21/09/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/09/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 137 5137: Yes l am
21/09/23, 11:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2165 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2165 - $1000 = $1165 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
21/09/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 137 5137: Yes , here since my per annum fee is 1165$ and l get to earn 1000$ it means my mother will have to pay only 165$. That's great.
21/09/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 137 5137: And then my parents get to pay the remaining balance and the accomodation fee .
21/09/23, 3:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. Now, It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself. Now, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well -

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee itself, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be as below -
21/09/23, 3:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, only your tuition fee is to be paid to the university which means, your fee balance becomes $1165 - $750 = $415 and this will have to be paid in one part on your arrival. 

2. If you go with the *On-campus accommodation*, you will have to pay the tuition fee of $1165 and your accommodation fee of $1250, which means the total fee to be paid to the university is $2415 and after your registration fee has been adjusted, the balance will be $2415 - $750 = $1665 which can be paid in two installments of $833 and $832. (August 2024/January 2025)

I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page here as well?
21/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes we clear.
21/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
21/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
21/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
21/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes we are
21/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/09/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 137 5137: No l reside in Bulawayo
22/09/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bubelihle!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/09/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
22/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Good day
22/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Thank you.
22/09/23, 2:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference? <This message was edited>
22/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 137 5137: Yes , please . Will choose between the two.
22/09/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

22/09/23, 2:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, before we move forward and conclude our conversation regarding your offer letter from PDM University, may I ask if you have any queries you would like to ask?
22/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 137 5137: No l don't have any queries
22/09/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.

May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
