18/10/23, 9:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
18/10/23, 9:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/10/23, 9:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/10/23, 9:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
18/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you we can move forward
18/10/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 482 2511: These two steps there are clear.
18/10/23, 9:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
18/10/23, 9:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/10/23, 9:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
18/10/23, 9:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
18/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 482 2511: On step 1  are there any hard copies l can go through .
18/10/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 482 2511: Besides videos on step 1. do we have hard copies inform of documents?
18/10/23, 9:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: @263774822511 I appreciate your concern, although I want to inform you that we will share the videos with you soon.
18/10/23, 9:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: May I kindly know the reason why you want to have the documents for the step 1?
18/10/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you we may proceed
18/10/23, 9:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
18/10/23, 9:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/10/23, 9:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
18/10/23, 9:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
18/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you my parents are prepared to pay.

19/10/23, 11:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
19/10/23, 11:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
19/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 482 2511: Most welcome .
19/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you l will do as you say .
19/10/23, 11:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263774822511. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Diploma in Business Administration* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you once again l have joined the group and l am now sending the information
19/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 482 2511: We may begin.
19/10/23, 11:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome Audrey, I am glad to know that you have joined your EWYL group.
19/10/23, 11:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 11:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 11:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 11:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you for sharing such information with me
19/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 482 2511: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 482 2511: I am honored thank you once again .The information is correct .
19/10/23, 12:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome Audrey. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Well noted on that.
19/10/23, 12:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 482 2511: That is true we are on the same page l once had such discussion.
19/10/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

$2000 - $3000 Range:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
19/10/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
19/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Can l ask.
What if not residing at the campus
19/10/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263774822511. The above information is just an example When you will receive offer letter you will be informed about on-campus accommodation and off-campus accommodation.
19/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you for helping me . It is clear .
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you the information is very clear.Ms Ashi  so  $1025 you can pay it whilst you already in India or.
19/10/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263774822511 You can pay your fees while you are in India. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/10/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/10/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you once again l really appreciate it .
19/10/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are really welcome Audrey. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 482 2511: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 482 2511: For now we are good to move forward l have no queries.
19/10/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth.

19/10/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/10/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
19/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 482 2511: OK let me go through them.l will information you soon as possible.
19/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 482 2511: We may proceed  to discuss each of them in detail ,one by one.
19/10/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where  scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 1:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Audrey, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Wooow that is an interesting information.
19/10/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 482 2511: I can clearly understand it and l am ready to be on it .
19/10/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Ms Ashi so the amount of $750 right that is where l will pay $600 instead.
19/10/23, 2:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263774822511, With the help of Endowment Program your registration fees is reduced from $750 to $600.
19/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Well ,l welcome the move   l am really delighted.My family are prepared to pay the rest of the amount.
19/10/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263774822511
19/10/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 2:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 2:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 482 2511: So far so good l had followed all  the details .there is nothing l would want to inquire at the most.
19/10/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you  i would like you to provide me with more information about this process .
19/10/23, 2:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome @263774822511,  let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 2:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 2:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 2:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
19/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 482 2511: I can see that Edoofa plays an important role.
19/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 482 2511: I really had an inesting information and now l have  information and knowledge about it.Thank you once again
19/10/23, 2:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
19/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 482 2511: So it means there will not be able to pursue  his or her bachelor's education .
19/10/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Ms Ashi so the student will be then allowed to choose between  these.
19/10/23, 3:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: These preferences are based on student's choice.
19/10/23, 3:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
19/10/23, 3:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
19/10/23, 3:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
19/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Yes we may discuss .
19/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 482 2511: That  will be good when it is based on student's choice.
19/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 482 2511: True l now  have the idea about it
19/10/23, 3:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
19/10/23, 3:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 482 2511: It is clear so the student given choice and opportunity to select was is good for here right
19/10/23, 3:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
19/10/23, 3:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
19/10/23, 3:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Ms Ashi does it means on that pint l will have to stop the EWYL .
19/10/23, 3:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, Your EWYL will still be going on
19/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 482 2511: Thank you l now understand .
19/10/23, 3:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome Audrey, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 482 2511: I am honored and also excited  .l promise l will work hard .Thank you so much.
