06/11/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the academic documents it is duly noted with us. I would like to inquire if you will be available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 301 4570: I am available now
06/11/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
06/11/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
06/11/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
06/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Noted ma'am .
Thank you.
06/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
06/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
06/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
06/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 301 4570: I have reviewed all the benefits.
06/11/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
06/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
06/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Samantha, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
06/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Ok well noted ma'am.
Since you will be applying to various universities, what if l am selected by more than one University.
06/11/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263783014570 yes, please we will discuss the offer letter from all the universities and then you will have the option to select the best university as per your preference.
06/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Ok , thank you ma'am.
06/11/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/11/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/11/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Well explained ma'am.
06/11/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/11/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263783014570 may I know if we are still connected with each other?
06/11/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you however, as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm, have a great night ahead.
07/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 301 4570: I am available now .
07/11/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, may I know if you are clear so far?
07/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 301 4570: I am clear , thank you.
07/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 301 4570: I understood it very well.
07/11/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
07/11/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
07/11/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
07/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 301 4570: No ma'am, it is very clear.
07/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 301 4570: I am not aware of the process, please provide me with more information on it.
07/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
07/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
07/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Well noted.
07/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Very correct.
07/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
07/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 301 4570: I agree ma'am.
07/11/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/11/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/11/23, 11:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to reconnect again tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!
08/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Samantha.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected with each other?
08/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Good afternoon maam. I am available now.
08/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, may I know if you are clear so far?
08/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Everything was explained very well and clearly.
08/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
08/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
08/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Very clear
08/11/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Okay, so the EWYL will be a way of paying back the enrollment fee?
08/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please that is correct.
08/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Thank you.
08/11/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
08/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 301 4570: I have no queries as of now but if there will be  any, l will ask .
08/11/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
08/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 301 4570: We are so excited ma'am.
08/11/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
08/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Thank you ma'am. Have a good day ahead.
08/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you.
17/11/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted

13/12/23, 8:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *Urgent update for your University Scholarship Application*

Good Morning Parents and Samantha,

I hope this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Vilsha, Head of Admissions at Edoofa. Following a recent discussion with Ms. Kirti regarding your scholarship application, it has come to our attention that you missed the due date to secure your scholarship seat, unfortunately resulting in not benefiting from the Endowment Program.
13/12/23, 8:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: We understand that pursuing education abroad comes with challenges, and we recognize that unforeseen circumstances may have led to difficulties in securing the scholarship seat. However, given the competitive nature of scholarship opportunities, Ms. Kirti has expressed concerns about the potential loss of this valuable opportunity if we delay any longer.
13/12/23, 8:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: While our team has been consistently reaching out to you to understand your concerns in-depth, time is of the essence. To proactively address this matter, I have personally scheduled a meeting with the academic board and university officials on the 15th of December 2023 to present your case and explore potential solutions.
13/12/23, 8:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To present a compelling case on your behalf, we need your assistance and specific information:

1. *Challenge/Concern Details:* Please share the specific challenges or concerns that led to missing the opportunity to secure the scholarship seat.

2. *Plans Moving Forward:* Outline your plans for moving forward in pursuing education abroad.

3. *How We Can Help:* Specify how you wish for us to assist you with the challenges you are facing.
13/12/23, 8:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You have to share this information in a single message with us after discussing it with your family by the end of tomorrow. Your timely update is important for us to thoroughly understand your situation and find the most effective way to support you before our scheduled meeting on the 15th of December, and hence we hope you will take this update seriously and share the necessary details.

Best regards,  
Ms. Vilsha  
Head of Admissions  
Edoofa
13/12/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 301 4570: 1.My tuition fee per semester is $1800.
2.The standard duration of my course is 5 years.
3. The admission and Procedure Fee is $300
4.The registration fee is $750.
13/12/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the response, with regard to the message shared above by Ms. Vilsha you can surely share your concerns after our discussion and once you have a better understanding of the letter. Also, could you please recheck for question 1, as the question states your per semester fee after the scholarship?
13/12/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Thank you ma'am .
The semester fee after scholarship is $900
13/12/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
13/12/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Well noted ma'am . I understand very well.
13/12/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
13/12/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
13/12/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 301 4570: I have understood it very well ma'am.
13/12/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
13/12/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Galgotias University really puts students up front.
13/12/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
13/12/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 301 4570: It is very clear maam
13/12/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
13/12/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
13/12/23, 10:32 pm - +263 78 301 4570: We are together ma'am.
I understand that very well.
14/12/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well. I was expecting to hear back from you earlier yesterday, as it had been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours and therefore I was not able to get back to you, however, we can connect now. So may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Good afternoon ma'am.
My apologies for the late response, my aunt is not around and she is coming today so  l will be able to answer this tomorrow after discussing with her
14/12/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please Samantha as I mentioned above yesterday you can surely share your concerns after our discussion and once you have a better understanding of the letter. So may I know if you are available to connect with us so that we can continue with our discussion?
14/12/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Thank you. Iam available now.
14/12/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so may I know if you were are clear so far?
14/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 301 4570: Everything is very clear
14/12/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
14/12/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
