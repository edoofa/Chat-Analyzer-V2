This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

11/12/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which she provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend your family, take great pride in your achievements, and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

11/12/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
11/12/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

Visit Your School: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

Provide Necessary Information: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

Printing and Signing: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

Include Authority Details: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
11/12/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
11/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok lemme finish up
11/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Today

11/12/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, now coming back to your concern above, if you can share your forms by today before our closing hours it will be a very proactive step and if not please note that It's important that all three forms and your academic documents with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
11/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok

11/12/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have discussions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have discussions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 P.m. to 09:30 PM)?
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 303 5080: 01:00 pm
11/12/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s discussion at this time. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm CAT for our next discussion.

Now that we are done with the forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
11/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes am available
11/12/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
11/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
11/12/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 303 5080: You can explain
11/12/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/12/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
11/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes they are
11/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
11/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
11/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 303 5080: What is the SOP
11/12/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *The Statement of Purpose (SOP)* is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok noted let’s continue
11/12/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/12/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
11/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 303 5080: They are very clear
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
11/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 303 5080: This fee is supposed to be paid in what time frame !?
11/12/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263713035080 Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, and this query of yours will also be answered in the coming steps. I would encourage you to be patient, please.
11/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok so we may proceed
11/12/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
11/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yess
11/12/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
11/12/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
11/12/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
11/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yess
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
11/12/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
11/12/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the understanding of the 4 videos.
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Student must be open minded and must be reachable that’s the most essential part. Secondly  Edoofa is there  to  increase the student capacity for success finally  founders   Encourage students to follow instructions
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the remaining videos.
12/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 303 5080: And students should Be prompt and delligent in signing the SOP papers more so and students must be more responsible
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.
12/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Noted mam
12/12/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
12/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes. Madam we are on the same page
12/12/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:00 PM.
12/12/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

12/12/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok so this answer are need by tomorrow
12/12/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct, also could you share updates regarding the letter of recommendation?
12/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 303 5080: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes l will be able Mam
13/12/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Edward.

I trust you're in good health. Referring to our recent conversation in the personal window, I'd like to ensure the accuracy of the information discussed. If it's helpful, I'm more than willing to repost those messages here for clarity. Please let me know if that would be beneficial for you.
13/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
13/12/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the messages again here for clarity. I had an in-depth discussion with the academic board regarding the concerns you raised yesterday about frequent changes in courses. Based on this discussion, they have highlighted some concerns about your clarity on your academic and career preferences.
13/12/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is important for a student to choose a course that aligns with their interests and career goals. However, from the messages you shared, it appears that you might be uncertain about your academic direction. Before we proceed further with your admission journey, it's important for us to clarify this.
13/12/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As per our previous conversation and your discussion with your counselor, you expressed an interest in pursuing a degree in Law because of your passion for enforcing the law. Is this information accurate based on your current preferences?
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok noted  but l want change in course
13/12/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your update, Edward. I'm keen to understand the reason behind your recent decision to change your course preference. Initially, you seemed interested in pursuing Law, but now you've mentioned a desire to shift towards social work. Given that Law offers significant career opportunities in the field of social work, I'm curious about what prompted this change in your academic interests. Could you kindly provide some insight into your thought process
13/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Social work has more life opportunities and basing with my family background it’s a job tha had demand and it can make  me have better opportunities in other nations
13/12/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263713035080 could you please elaborate more on your statement here because regarding career opportunities, Law is generally considered a more sought-after and esteemed field than Social Work. This is because individuals with a Law degree can also qualify for a license in Social Work. However, the reverse isn't true; a Social Work degree doesn't qualify someone for a Law license.
13/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 303 5080: A social work license gives me  work any where in the globe l wont have to go another year for school if l tend to work in one nation that’s unlike law if l change a country am forced to  go to school for another year and after social work it’s straight to work
13/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 303 5080: More so My researche on Zimbabwean situation today social workers are on demand and on the market it's easy to get employment than ..,. Some points
13/12/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Edward, while I can understand your perspective, I'm afraid that is not the case. The requirements for pursuing a career in your chosen field, whether it is Social Work or Law, remain the same. Edoofa, with over 15 years of experience in the education sector, is not just connected with universities, we also have associations with education ministries and industrialists in various sectors.
13/12/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We have valuable insights into what recruiters look for and how students can achieve success and that is the reason the students enroll in the Edoofa Progam. If you aim to pursue a career in Social Work, we are here to guide you on how to keep your career options open. 

However, Edward, I must say, if you feel our recommendations are not based on experience or are not in your best interest, I am a bit concerned about your perception. We are not any agents helping you with your university admissions for the course you desire, but rather we are an organization dedicated to making you employable by providing affordable and accessible quality education through the right career path.
13/12/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Should you be willing to consider our viewpoint and suggestions, I would be very pleased to engage in a discussion with you to offer further assistance. Additionally, while I hope this doesn't come across incorrectly, as your admissions officer, and in the education Industry for a long time, you as students tend to not miss out on the bigger picture, and it is my responsibility to make you aware of the same.
13/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 303 5080: I get it mam but  the degree of choice l note to see as fit is social work Mam
13/12/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Edward, I completely respect your aspiration to build a career in Social Work, and as I've assured before, I am here to support you in this endeavor. However, it's important for you to recognize that, as educators in the field of education, we have a comprehensive understanding of what might be most beneficial for your career development. This is why we're here – to assist and guide you towards the best possible path. If Social Work is truly where your interests lie, we are fully prepared to help you pursue this path. My only concern is that the approach you're currently considering might not be the most effective one for achieving your career goals in Social Work.
13/12/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If your interest lies in Social Work, you actually have a couple of options for your studies - Sociology or Law. From the perspective of the admissions team, we recommend considering a Law degree. This is because a Law qualification tends to be more highly regarded than Sociology. After completing a Law degree, you could still pursue Sociology and enter the field of Social Work, thereby keeping your career options broad and diverse.
13/12/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You might also be aware that Law is typically a 5-year course, while Sociology is usually 3 years. Have you thought about why there's this difference in duration? It suggests different depths and scopes of study in each field. While you seem clear about your career direction, the exact pathway to achieve it might still need some exploration. It's important to understand which course aligns best with your long-term career goals and offers the most opportunities.
13/12/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As your admissions officer and an educator, with Edoofa having over 15 years of experience in the education sector, we aim to guide you correctly based on our expertise and understanding of the industry. I recommend taking some time, perhaps a day, to research both Law and Social Work thoroughly. This will help you make an informed decision about which course will be more beneficial for you in the long run. Remember, the final decision is yours, but we are here to provide you with the best possible guidance.
13/12/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 303 5080: I have researched well Ms kirti l don’t wants degrees in-law or sociology l want a degree in social work thank you and that’s my final say
13/12/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to see that you've taken the time to research your desired career path. However, I must inform you that the information you've gathered may not be entirely accurate. Drawing from my experience in the education sector, I've seen how students sometimes focus on immediate career goals without fully considering the long-term implications. If your interest lies in Social Work, I've already outlined a potential path for you. Additionally, it's important to note that many universities internationally have phased out Social Work as a specific degree program, opting instead to offer Sociology. This shift has been made with the understanding that a Sociology degree can directly prepare students for a career in Social Work. May I know if you were aware of the same?
13/12/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can respond to the message above by tomorrow, since it is past our available hours in that case, we will not be able to continue with our discussion which will lead to a broken discussion so let us reconnect tomorrow and start with our discussion. I hope you will be available. Have a great night ahead.
14/12/23, 3:16 am - +263 71 303 5080: Am not aware
14/12/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Edward.

14/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now coming back to our discussion from yesterday let me help you understand why many universities internationally have phased out Social Work as a specific degree program.

1. Changing Academic Focus and Resources: Universities re-evaluate their program offerings to align with their academic strengths, resources, and strategic goals and demands of the course. Social Work as a degree is phased out since the market demand for the same is low. A university finds that its strengths and resources better support a Sociology program rather than Social Work, through Sociology the student would have border career aspirations with social work included.

2. Market Demand and Employment Trends: Institutions might shift their program offerings in response to changing job market demands. If there's a perception or data indicating a higher demand for sociology professionals over social workers, a university might adjust its programs accordingly and sociology in the present time is in a high demand. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. Overlap in Disciplines: Sociology is the branch to develop a career in social work. Universities might choose to offer a more broad-based Sociology degree, which can still provide foundational knowledge relevant to social work, while also covering a wider range of topics.

4. Curriculum Focus and Flexibility: Sociology programs typically offer a broader exploration of social issues, theories, and research methods compared to Social Work. Universities shift to Sociology to offer students a wider scope of study.
14/12/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to note that the introduction of Sociology and discontinuation of Social Work doesn't reflect the value of one field over the other. Instead, it often represents a strategic decision by the university based on a multitude of factors, including educational goals, resource allocation, market trends, and student interests and what is right for the students to consider.
14/12/23, 7:20 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Tthank you Mam so if l cant get social work l new  physiotherapy or occupational therapy
14/12/23, 7:23 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Or speech and language therapy either of those l don’t want to do sociology
14/12/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome Edward, while I completely understand your interest in Physiotherapy and occupational therapy, it's important to note that your A-level subject combination focus on arts subjects may not align with the eligibility criteria for a Physiotherapy program, which typically requires a background in science subjects. This limitation is something to consider as you explore your academic options.
