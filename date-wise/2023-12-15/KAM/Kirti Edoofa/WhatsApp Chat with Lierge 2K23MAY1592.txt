17/10/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 955 0442: On the registration process,once l receive the Admission Acceptance Letter l have to register to reserve my seat with the university.The registration is done through paying the registration fee of about 500to 750 dollars .
17/10/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
17/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 955 0442: No everything is clear
17/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
17/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
17/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 955 0442: I am very excited and l can not wait to receive the Offer Letter
17/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Your efforts are always appreciated
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
17/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Wow this is exciting news indeed.All thanks to the Edoofa team .
17/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words. Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Lierge, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Well understood.l am glad to here about the endowment plan.
17/10/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Yes  it do
17/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Wow this is great news indeed
17/10/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 955 0442: This is very helpful because it can ease the financial burden.
17/10/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Yes l would like you to provide more information on that one.
17/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
17/10/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Well understood
17/10/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
17/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Yes
17/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Thank you for clarity
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Ok
17/10/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Very clear
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 955 0442: That is very fair.
17/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 955 0442: No queries.Everything is straight forward.
17/10/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Lierge's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that lierge is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Very excited
17/10/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
17/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Ok thank you.Have a blessed day as well
02/11/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Lierge,

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/11/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Understood
03/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
03/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Clear
03/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that now moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
03/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Clear
03/11/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
03/11/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
03/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 955 0442: We are altogether but my parents will not afford .l am from a low income family
03/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I recognize that coming up with such an amount might be tough, which is why, in line with our earlier conversation and the benefits available to you under the Endowment plan, you might remember that you're eligible for a *$150 grant* to go towards the registration fee. Moreover, there’s a payment plan available that’s designed to be adaptable to your needs. Would it be helpful if I went over the details of how this payment option operates?
03/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 955 0442: That will be better
03/11/23, 4:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
03/11/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
03/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Understood
03/11/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/11/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Yes l stay in Harare
03/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Thank u
03/11/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
03/11/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charle's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
03/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Noo l got the details
03/11/23, 5:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. However, let me share the details once again so that you do not have to scroll all the way to get them, and it will be convenient for you to access them easily.

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
03/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Oo thank you
03/11/23, 5:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
03/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Ok understood
03/11/23, 5:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
03/11/23, 5:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
03/11/23, 5:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
03/11/23, 5:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
03/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Yes its understood
03/11/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use earned the $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
03/11/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
03/11/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Its advantageous for sure
03/11/23, 5:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your EWYL mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
03/11/23, 5:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Ooh yes is Galgotias a public university and how is it ranked.l need more information or even pictures of this university
03/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 955 0442: In case that l come up with flying colours in my examination will any adjustments be made to my scholarship percentage
03/11/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries @263779550442 let me help you understand them one by one.

Coming to your first query, please do not worry I will definitely share the university's insights with you. However, before that, I would like to know what are your thoughts about a Public University, this will help me get a better understanding of your thoughts?
03/11/23, 5:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly @263779550442. I believe we did discuss it in our past discussions, however, it is alright if you do not recall it. If you want I am more than happy to help you recall?
03/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 955 0442: A public university is the one owned by the government.Usually a public university is cheaper as it is funded by the government.
03/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Yel l need to recall
03/11/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please I will surely help you recall, however, let me help you with your first query here so that we can understand better and do not mix the queries, right?
03/11/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts about a Public University. Now, let me help you with the Education System of India. There are two types of Universities as shared below -
03/11/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Public Universities -* Since Public University receives funding from the government, they are more affordable and are given more credibility when compared to private universities to be admitted there, students have to sit for a National Level Entrance Exam and there are no scholarships offered, apart from that, there is no provision for international students to take admitted over there. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, there are multiple institutes and colleges affiliated with those universities, and students can enroll in those institutes, the degree which they get is directly from the public university they are affiliated with and has the institute's name written on it. Basically, the students study at an institute/college but are registered with the university.
03/11/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Private Universities -* When we talk about Private Universities, International students can easily be admitted over there on a scholarship, they would pursue their education at the university and would be registered there, however since these are private universities, the fee structures are a little higher when compared to public universities. I hope you are clear with the difference first?
03/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Thank you for clarity
03/11/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now coming back to your second query, let me help you recall here. For a student to pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship they would need to attain two passes which is basically two E grades for a 50% scholarship, however, if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

I hope this clarifies the query that you had in your mind?
03/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Yes it does
03/11/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now to attend to the last part of our discussion and your concern about the ranking and pictures, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
03/11/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
03/11/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
03/11/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

06/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: .vcf (file attached)
06/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 955 0442: Thank you a lot
06/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 16, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected with each other?

11/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

I understand that your parents must be busy and you must not have the required network to connect over a call, however, I would like to reiterate that your first deadline for the university stands tomorrow and  I am ready to have a discussion with you if you are actively present in the group as well because if you miss the deadline tomorrow you will be losing on an opportunity for yourself, however, I would really appreciate if you can make your parents connect with us here over texts so that we can get to know their challenges and after the discussion maybe I can help you come up with a solution that can save your seat with the university.

15/11/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. Considering the university's due date of November 16, 2023, my understanding is that instead of a payment of $300 on that date, you are in a position to pay $300, by the 27th of November which is next week and the remaining $300 as per the second deadline. Is my understanding accurate, and does it align with your intended timeline?

I've taken the time to respond to you, so I was able to have a conversation with the Academic Board today and I presented a strong case, however, the academic board was a little disappointed in you because the days when you were not responding could have been utilized for this discussion and we could have been able to come up with a solution earlier. 

I mentioned that you were unable to communicate because of network problems, after my best efforts they have decided to offer you an extension till the 27th of November, however, they even mentioned that this will be the last extension if you delay more than 27th of November you will end up losing your scholarship from the Galgotia's University, please.
