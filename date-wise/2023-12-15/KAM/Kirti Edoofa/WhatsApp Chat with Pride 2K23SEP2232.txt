11/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Below is the  response to question 1 in the form of audio recording
11/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 243 1666: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
11/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
11/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe Pride wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
11/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you
11/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 243 1666: That is correct
11/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
11/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 243 1666: May I kindly be excused just for today I am not feeling well, am currently at the local health center  may  we start tomorrow
11/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Of course, your health is the top priority. Please take the time you need to recover. Feel free to connect in the evening, or else we can connect tomorrow at 12:30 pm.
11/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Good day, l will
12/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes true  you have to enroll in one of the universities
12/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Sorry for delay in  response , have been in the EWYL session, on the same note trying to balance up with work
12/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes my counselor shared the information with me
12/10/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No problem at all. It's great to see your dedication to the EWYL session and balancing it with work.
12/10/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just *$2000 to $3000 per year*. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes we are
12/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
12/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes  have taken note
12/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am following , am understanding that l should have  at 750 at hand so that  if l am offered a place l should pay, then when my child arrives in India she should have at least $1025 .
12/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I appreciate the  way how you lay  out state of preparedness in terms of tution fee
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding and for acknowledging the financial aspects related to your child's education in India. It's important to be well-prepared.
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
13/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Pride,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
13/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Good afternoon to you too too

13/10/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see your commitment for the EWYL session, however, since I am heading for a meeting now let us reconnect today at 08:00 pm.
13/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Noted thank you
13/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Good evening
13/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I am now  here for the session
13/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too. I am happy to connect with you again. May I know if you are available to connect?
14/10/23, 8:12 am - +263 77 243 1666: Good morning, l think there was network problem.There were heavy rains here.
14/10/23, 8:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Pride.

I hope this message finds you well. I understand that network problems can occur due to adverse weather conditions like heavy rains. It's good to hear from you now. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/10/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 243 1666: My apologies for now am attending a meeting at work and I am not sure when l will finish
14/10/23, 9:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Work meetings are important, and I understand they can take up your time. However, our available working hours for today are from 08:00 am to 01:30 pm only, hence we will not be available in the evening, the discussion will not take more than an hour, if you are actively present.
16/10/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Good afternoon, today l am present for discussions
16/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes
16/10/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Very clear
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
16/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes it's clear
16/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
16/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
16/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Very clear
16/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
16/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes it's clear, l have a family member here who is asking-  on the last part of giving up and getting benefits, he is asking if you can remain  an Edoofian and continue doing EWYL program  here in Zimbabwe
16/10/23, 5:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your inquiry. If you decide not to pursue your education, we will remain in contact with you for a year through the EWYL program. However, if you continue to postpone your studies after that period, it may not be feasible for us to maintain ongoing communication. Though we can connect once in a while. We have other students to assist and processes to initiate, as well. If you decide to start with your higher education again, we can always resume your journey to becoming an Edoofian.
16/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you so much
16/10/23, 5:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes am now well informed
16/10/23, 5:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Pride's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Pride is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
16/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Very very much,
16/10/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you so much , today l had a wonderful session
16/10/23, 5:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Likewise, have a great day ahead.
02/11/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Pride,

Following our previous conversation, our admissions team has been diligently engaged in the thorough evaluation of your scholarship application for Indian universities, specifically under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to announce that your application has been successfully reviewed and accepted by one of the prestigious institutions, *Quest University* in India. Furthermore, they have chosen to extend a scholarship offer to you.
02/11/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete your university admission formalities. For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
03/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you again

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am well thanks and    I am ready for the discussion. Yes I did go through the letter
03/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. To ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin our discussion
03/11/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 243 1666: 1. Annual tuition is $1200
2.$750-00 would opt for the cheapest
3.yes $750 will be part of the total fees am expected to pay
03/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1200.

Along with this, there is a $100 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your uniform fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1200, the total comes out to be $1300.
03/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes  am following
03/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
03/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
03/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per anum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1300  + $500 = $1800. I hope you are clear about this?
03/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you for the enlightenment on outside campus accomodations. True is relatively cheaper
03/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am clear on that
03/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.
03/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
03/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes am clear
03/11/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1800 - $1000 = $800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.
03/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
03/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes I can see of which $800 is very much affordable
03/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
03/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes  it is clear
03/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a *$150 grant* applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
03/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes may you please explain
03/11/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
03/11/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
03/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Absolutely clear
03/11/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/11/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 243 1666: No l stay in Bulawayo which is another city in Zimbabwe
03/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Truely l need assistance in that regard - method of payment
03/11/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/11/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I have served his number and will contact him
03/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
03/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charle's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
03/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 243 1666: May you just give me, so that I will be certain
03/11/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
03/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Noted with thanks surely this the best to minimize traveling with cash
03/11/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/11/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Not related to the enrollment, may t kindly highlight to on the amount for visa and traveling expenses, one of my family member is asking ,so that we are very clear of our budget
03/11/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you with that. The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself and the vis fee will be $83
03/11/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you for that information we may go ahead
03/11/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In that case, let me also tell you a bit about the Quest Group of institutions. It is the most ideal destination for international students interested in studying in India. They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
03/11/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It has a Unique Mentorship program to encourage students to do well according to their abilities and strengths and has been awarded Outstanding Technical Institution of North India during the World Education Summit and Awards.
03/11/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Quest Group of Institutions is approved by the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), the statutory body for Technical Education under the Ministry of HRD, Govt. of India. It is affiliated with IKG Punjab Technical University, which is a Govt. University ranked amongst the top public universities in India.

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by tomorrow morning and also discuss the way forward for Pride's admission process
