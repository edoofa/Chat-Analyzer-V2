06/09/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Belinda,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024.

26/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 273 3391: You are welcome
26/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 273 3391: We are anticipating them with enthusiasm
26/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Do let me know when you have gone through the above benefits one by one.
27/10/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Belinda,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
30/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 273 3391: That's an amazing opportunity
30/10/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/10/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/10/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda.

I hope you are doing well. I couldn't help but notice that we have not been able to have a smooth conversation for the past few days and delays are affecting Belinda's scholarship application, please I would encourage you to be transparent with us, and let us know if there are some kind of challenges that you are facing? <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing from you, but considering that it has been a long day for me and our working hours have now ended, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow. I hope you'll be available then.
02/11/23, 5:17 am - +263 77 273 3391: It makes sense
02/11/23, 5:17 am - +263 77 273 3391: Good morning

I hope you are doing well. I completely understand that the network can be a challenge however, as we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
02/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 273 3391: It's okay
02/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Tomorrow is best...let's schedule that way
02/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please in that case, can I anticipate that you will be available tomorrow at 12:30 pm CAT?
03/11/23, 11:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. I was hoping to get a response from you, however, since it is past our available hours now. I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 01:30 p.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
04/11/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I've managed to conclude my work engagements sooner than anticipated today and was wondering if this might be a convenient time for you to engage in a discussion with us?
04/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. As our available hours for Saturday are over we will be connecting with you on Monday. Have a great day and weekend ahead.
06/11/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda.

I trust you're all in good health. Following up on our previous discussion, may I inquire if now is a convenient time for us to have connect and have a discussion?

06/11/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. May I know if you are clear so far?
06/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772733391 may I know if we are still connected with each other?
07/11/23, 11:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to reconnect again tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!
08/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected with each other?
08/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Good day
08/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
08/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Let's connect tomorrow
08/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are facing some challenges?
08/11/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to complete the admission process for Belinda, we have been delaying the process a lot. I would appreciate if you share your concerns if you have any with us openly and be active in this conversation. Given that we have not completed our timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of the process. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently and hoping to connect with you tomorrow at 08:30 am.
09/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Let's move on with the process please
11/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
11/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda.

I hope you are doing well. It was a great time with my family during the festival. As we can connect now and move ahead with the discussions I would like to inquire if you are available to connect with us now?
17/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Thank you
17/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Hope you enjoyed your holiday
17/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed I enjoyed the festival with my family,may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Yes
17/11/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing so may I know if you are clear so far?
17/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Clear
17/11/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Yes I get it.
17/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/11/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 273 3391: It's clear
17/11/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 273 3391: It's OK.  Proceed with further information
17/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/11/23, 7:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Belinda,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 273 3391: That's a great advantage
18/11/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
20/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you regarding the acknowledgment of the above messages, however, you did not respond may I know if we are still connected? <This message was edited>

09/12/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Yes you are clear
11/12/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda.

I hope you are doing well. I have been hoping to get a response from your end for the past few weeks however, it seems as if my messages were not able to get through. Hence may I know if we are still connected so that we can move ahead with our discussion as it has been a long time since we connected?
11/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 273 3391: We are connected
11/12/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know if you why were you not able to connect with us during the past few weeks?
11/12/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Network problems
11/12/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I recognize that network issues can occasionally be problematic. However, experiencing network challenges continuously since the 21st of November seems unusual. May I inquire if everything is in order? Please feel free to openly share any concerns you might have with me?
11/12/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I had anticipated a response from you, but since there was none and considering the day has been quite long for me, along with the fact that our available hours have now ended. Let us reconnect tomorrow to resume our conversation. I'm hopeful that you'll be available tomorrow at 01:00 pm. Wishing you a wonderful night ahead.
11/12/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Sorry I m driving
11/12/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Thank you
12/12/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Belinda,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you yesterday. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday.

Therefore, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can start our discussion?
12/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Go ahead with new discussions only.
12/12/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
12/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 273 3391: It's clear
12/12/23, 4:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 273 3391: That's understandable
12/12/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/12/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/12/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Understandable
12/12/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
12/12/23, 5:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
13/12/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
13/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 273 3391: It's clear
13/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 273 3391: How long is the diploma course
13/12/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A diploma is a 3 year course @263772733391
13/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Do you have an advantage when you are then doing the degree
13/12/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you save one year from your bachelor's degree. For example, if a bachelor's degree is three years, for you after diploma it becomes two years
14/12/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Belinda

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication? <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 273 3391: That one understood
14/12/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/12/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Goood idea
14/12/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/12/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 273 3391: No questions
14/12/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Belinda's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that she is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
14/12/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 273 3391: I m glad
14/12/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 273 3391: We start the process
14/12/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
