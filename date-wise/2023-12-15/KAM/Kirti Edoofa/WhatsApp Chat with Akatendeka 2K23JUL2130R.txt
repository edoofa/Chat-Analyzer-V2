31/07/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Akatendeka.

I hope you doing well, thank you for sharing the forms, I did go through the forms and I noticed that you have mentioned that your year of university admission is 2023, however, as per our record from the counseling team your year of intake is 2024, so could you please help me provide the clarity for the same?
31/07/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Ya, true. 2024 is the year.
31/07/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Kindly make the correction for us plz.
31/07/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 211 2579: We're aware she is due to come to India for her degree program next year, but since the process has begun this year, we mixed up. Sorry for inconveniences caused. Is it correctable?
31/07/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you do not need to print a new form you can update the same in this form and share the picture with us of the updated form.
31/07/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Ok. We'll definitely do that.
31/07/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response.
01/08/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/08/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/08/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/08/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Very clear
01/08/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/08/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes let's proceed
01/08/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 211 2579: We've nothing to wait for. Let's delve straight into it.
01/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
01/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
01/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
01/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
01/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
01/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
01/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
01/08/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Our network is not pretty good. Would you be comfortable giving us 2hrs to go through them all and summarise them all? My suggestion would be for us to continue at 3:30 PM local time.
01/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Having watched the first video, I've learned that EDOOFIANS are expected to follow instructions and to be open-minded--They must be prepared to go an extra mile. With these two qualities, EDOOFIANS will succeed through the earn while you learn program and, ultimately, they will be employable after finishing their courses.
01/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 211 2579: From the 2nd video, the take-home point is: EDOOFA's vision is to make education affordable for African learners and that after tertiary education, they must be employable. Students themselves achieve that by following instructions and being open-minded.
01/08/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Video 3 focuses on schools, colleges and universities. EDOOFA has spent in excess of ten years identifying suitable institutions condusive for fruitful learning. In some cases, EDOOFA has done an extensive work to create proper learning environments in those institutions. EDOOFA has identified institutions which are well resourced with sufficient infra-structure, well-trained educationists who are not just after accruing wealth and those offering relevant degree programs. The institutions have vibrant cultures--In such, learners have been adequately trained to live peaceably with each other. In such schools, colleges and universities, students are offered affordable education and they're equipped with attitudes, skills and knowledge which will make them profitably employable.
01/08/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Video 4 is on the statement of purpose (SOP). This is a document in which an applicant writes a personal recommendation, citing his or her goals, vision and solid personal achievements. A good academic progress is anticipated in this write-up to make one acceptable in a university of choice.
01/08/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 100 3606: I also watched video 1. I learned that through the earn while you learn program Edoofians after they finish their courses they will be employable. Also Edoofians must follow  the  instructions and have open mind so that they will succeed through the earn while you learn program
01/08/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Video 2 , I have learned that Edoofa has a vision for African learners to be employable after completing their courses also to make their education affordable
01/08/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Video 3, it focuses on universities, colleges and schools which are under Edoofa. In these schools, colleges and universities, students are offered affordable education and they are equipped with attitudes and skills which will make them profitable . Also Edoofa has done excellent  work to creat proper learning environments in some institutions. These institutions include well trained educationists who are not just after accruing wealth and those offering relevant degree progams .The institutions have vibrant cultures such as learners have been adequately trained to live in peace with others
01/08/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Video 4, states about  the statement of purpose where a student writes personal achievements, goals and also a personal recommendation. This will make one acceptable in a university of choice due to good academic process in this document
01/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Praise.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
01/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
01/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
01/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 211 2579: That's correct. We grasped the points elucidated in the videos; and, thank you for the recap.
01/08/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
01/08/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 211 2579: All in order with us.
01/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
01/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
01/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
01/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. O-Level Results*

*2. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
01/08/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Ok, thank you. We've the A. Level results, but the O. Level certificate is still to be collected from the boarding institution where Akatendeka learned. Can we proceed and use the A. Level results, or the O. Level certificate has to be made available at any cost?
01/08/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Noted with thanks ma'am
01/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, you can share your A level result as well, and if you do not have the O level certificate then may I know if you have the O level result slip?
01/08/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 211 2579: We did not collect the result slip either because the results here can be viewed on the exams' board portal. So, we were not in a hurry to collect the hard copies. Besides, since we're preparing the girl for the 2024 intake, we thought we have all the time to put all the required stuff, including the passport, in place. My question is: would we need to pause the progress of this application until we have all the required documents? The honest truth is, the process has moved faster than we anticipated.
01/08/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand you here @263772112579, I would first like to know in how much time do you think you can collect the O level certificate?
01/08/23, 10:44 pm - +263 77 211 2579: We would need two months because, as I understand, we're definitely to be charged some storage fees by the school. Also, we've to apply for an international passport. Therefore, considering the huge amounts of money I have to channel into this whole business, I thought I would need this much time. I'm putting into consideration the fact that I've to pay $150 before the 29th of August. However, I owe it to you to grant the time that would keep the whole deal in the right frame. In other words, be free to suggest for me the time which would be permissible for our application to sail through untainted, Ma'am.
01/08/23, 10:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, I completely understand your concern here, however, you mentioned that the results can be accessed through the online portal may I know if that can be possible so that you can share the screenshot of the same?
01/08/23, 11:17 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Unfortunately, the portal is a once-off view. We viewed the results when they were publicised in 2021, and we were supposed to collect the hard copies afterwards. There is, therefore, no more provision for the results to be accessed online again.It's very unfortunate Ma'am.
02/08/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 100 3606: My parents are currently offline. However, thank you for understanding our situation. Be that as it may, i am beginning to work on the statement of purpose (SOP)now , and 9 pm today maybe too close. May u kindly give me up to tomorrow to work on the sop
02/08/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that you are working on the SOP now, however, may I know what challenges are you facing since students are able to fill the SOP and complete the tasks within a day's time?
02/08/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 100 3606: I had been stopped by the absence of the required documents . So , with the concertion we have made , i must begin to work on it now , which leaves me with a short time before 9 pm
02/08/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, will you be able to fill the SOP form and complete the tasks by tomorrow 12.30 Pm?
02/08/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 100 3606: This message was deleted
02/08/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes ma'am. Thank you
02/08/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, we shall reconnect tomorrow at 12.30 pm. I hope you will be available.
02/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes i will be available without fail
02/08/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great day.
03/08/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 100 3606: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 100 3606: 2.   I have discovered, through education at school and life experience that there is no social structure which can be so binding as to inhibit individual activity and achievement. It is a sociological establishment that life perceptions are socially constructed. So, one can choose to defy these socially constructed barriers and achieve his or her dreams. Indeed, society is a figment of our imagination, because, for instance, it used to be a taboo for women to play football in Zimbabwe; but now, girls' soccer is part of the curriculum in Zimbabwean schools. Also, the ancient position is, disability means inability. However, my father, who is blind, worked against the odds to become a member of the working class in the Zimbabwean society.
 3.  For a working definition, sociology can be qualified as the scientific study of human behaviour in groups and the social forces that influence that behaviour. This definition implies that sociology is a science or, it employs the methods of science in explaining and predicting social phenomena. So, as a study of human social life, it impinches on social, political and intellectual aspects as well as the environment in which people find themselves---For instance, power, politics, unemployment, divorce, poverty, crime gender issues and so forth. 
     On ther other hand, Economics () is a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. Microeconomics analyzes what's viewed as basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers.

Macroeconomics analyzes the economy as a system where production, consumption, saving, and investment interact, and factors affecting it: employment of the resources of labour, capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public policies that have impact on these elements.

Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing "what is", and normative economics, advocating "what ought to be"; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics.Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, including business, finance, cybersecurity, health care, engineering and government.
     Now, these two disciplines are related to a great extent. I say so because almost all human behaviour is geared towards acquiring power and attaining gratification. Be that as it may, power without money amounts to nothing. This is as far as sociology and economics are related.
 4.Social institutions exist to meet society's fundamental needs, such as providing structure, guidance and order. Common examples of social institutions include family, church, schools and political parties.
They work as the backbone of a society.

Without the social institutions, a society cannot achieve fulfilment in terms of economy, academy or relationships. When there are no rules and regulations in a society, people are more likely to indulge in crime and other harmful activitieS. 
     However, institutions are abused by the powerful, I concede. In the family institution, for instance, women are always expected to play second fiddle to men. In many African societies, women were subjects of oppression. For instance, in Zimbabwe, women were not allowed to engage in formal gainful employment. They were understood to be keepers at home, and they were forced to do all the domestic chores. In church also, the bible has been interpreted as according women a secondrate status, dictating to them what they should wear, how and when they must talk, and so forth. The political institution gives us another example of abuse of the powerless. In many African states, people who do not agree with the politically strong, are often beaten or even killed.
 5.  Sociological primary groups are generally small and include intimate relationships, while secondary groups are  larger and more  impersonal. These groups provide a standard for guiding and evaluating our attitudes and behaviors.

 In the social sciences, social groups can be categorized based on the various group dynamics that define social organization. In sociological terms, groups can fundamentally be distinguished from one another by the extent to which their nature influence individuals and Primary groups are those in which individuals intimately interact and cooperate over a long period of time. Examples of primary groups are families, friends, peers, neighbors, classmates, sororities, fraternities, and church members. These groups are marked by primary relationships in which communication is informal.

 Secondary groups are groups of people who are not related or emotionally connected, yet work together to achieve a common interest, purpose or goal. Perfect examples of secondary groups are political parties and  work companies or such like institutions.Classrooms and public halls are common meeting places for secondary groups.

03/08/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Akatendeka.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents and we shall wait for the O- level result till 20th August. The rest of the documents are well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
03/08/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
03/08/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Noted with thanks ma'am
03/08/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Arts in Sociology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
03/08/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes you are correct
03/08/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
03/08/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes I am ready
03/08/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
03/08/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
03/08/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
03/08/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes your are correct
03/08/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
03/08/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
03/08/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
03/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes he did
03/08/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
03/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Could you clarify further, Ma'am. Good afternoon.
03/08/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 100 3606: I understand
03/08/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well, yes please, let me help you understand, I am sure your counselor must have explained to you the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year and how this cost will include the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses.

I hope we are clear here?
03/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Very clear, Ma'am; but if you could bear with me a little bit: Suppose I pay the initial registration fees and, for some unforeseeable reason, the deal falls through. Do I get refunds? Sorry to drag you back.
03/08/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, however, may I know why you think that you will fail after paying the registration fee?
03/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 211 2579: We don't plan to fail. That's why I mentioned UNFORESEEABLES. My concern still rests on the speed at which we're pushing the application while our entry target is 2024.
03/08/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, in such cases, after having a discussion with the parents and understanding the concern, if the concern is genuine we *try* to have a conversation with the Officials and Board members for an extension under *consideration.*
03/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Ok. Let's proceed. Long periods of time help us in Zimbabwe to gather the resources required in the education of our children. So, if we get strangled by the financial demands in the process, we will let you know so you may consider us for the aforementioned extension. Meanwhile, let's proceed, Ma'am.
03/08/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
03/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 211 2579: We understand Ma'am.
03/08/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
03/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 211 2579: True. It's crystal clear now.
03/08/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
03/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Everything is clear now. No queries so far. We may kindly proceed.
03/08/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
03/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Noted with thanks ma'am
03/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 211 2579: I'm glad as her dad to be on this platform to receive all information from the admission team firsthand. Thank you Ma'am.

However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Akatendeka's higher education?
09/09/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Greetings Ma'am and your team. We're doing very well here. We're waiting in keen anticipation for the progression of Akatendeka's application. As ever, we're running around to gather some necessary resources as and when we'll be advised about the next step to take.
17/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Akatendeka.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?

I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Sociology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes it's accurate
17/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes I remember
17/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 100 3606: You will be sharing my scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to my course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
 Once those universities accept my application, they will send me  the offer letters outlining my scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as my  university registration fee.
 So, out of all the offer letters I receive, I  will have to make a decision on which university I would like to study at, considering its ranking and my affordability, and then reserve my seat with that particular university.
Usual
17/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
17/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 100 3606: No ma'am
17/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 100 3606: I don't have any query
17/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
17/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
17/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Noted with thanks ma'am
17/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
17/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
17/10/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 100 3606: I have reviewed them
17/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students  A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Akatendeka, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Following
17/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes ma'am
17/10/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Yes ma'am
17/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 10:39 pm - +263 78 100 3606: It's clear ma'am
17/10/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 10:50 pm - +263 78 100 3606: I don't have any queries
17/10/23, 10:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 10:57 pm - +263 78 100 3606: I am excited
17/10/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
17/10/23, 11:01 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Noted with thanks ma'am
17/10/23, 11:08 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Greetings Ma'am. Sorry for going through a period of ill-health. We thank God you're recuperating well. Am having network issues here. Let me go through all the messages and respond accordingly.
02/11/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Akatendeka,

I trust this message finds you all in the best of health and with a positive outlook. I am delighted to have the opportunity to connect with you again, and I am eager to convey a significant update to you.

Following our previous conversation, our admissions team has been diligently engaged in the thorough evaluation of your scholarship application for Indian universities, specifically under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to announce that your application has been successfully reviewed and accepted by one of the prestigious institutions, *Galgotias University* in India. Furthermore, they have chosen to extend a scholarship offer to you.
02/11/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 03:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
02/11/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 03:30 PM to 05:30 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐

02/11/23, 10:50 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Greetings. All is in order Ma'am. I've no qualms engaging with you at the proposed time of 15:30hrs local time tomorrow. I'll have had sufficient time to research about Galgotias and compile our questions on the offer. Thank you Ma'am.
02/11/23, 10:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your confirmation, and I'm pleased to hear that everything is in order. I look forward to our scheduled meeting tomorrow at 03:30PM CAT.
02/11/23, 10:58 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Welcome.
03/11/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you again.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Greetings and good afternoon Ma'am. We're grapling to get connected. Unfortunately, our network is down. So, we're wandering about just to find the slightest connectivity. We're really keen to delve into this discussion and get the best understanding of the offer letter's contents.
03/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It sounds like you're having quite a challenge with the network situation. It’s definitely challenging when technology decides to act up, especially when you're eager to dive into an important discussion. May I know if you are comfortable to procced ahead with the discussion?
03/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 211 2579: The situation is quite bad Ma'am. I've travelled some distance from home to seek connectivity, but it's not working as anticipated. If you could kindly reschedule this meeting to Monday the 6th. I called the network people to enquire on the challenge which befell us in the morning, and they said the booster is down on account of lack of fuel. It's rather upsetting when one has serious appointments as this on. I just can't help it Ma'am.
03/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm really sorry to hear about the difficulties you’re facing with the connection. It can indeed be incredibly aggravating when technical issues disrupt our plans. Rescheduling to Monday can be possible, however, considering the time-sensitive nature, since the offer letter is issued by Universities that have certain guidelines. I would not suggest connecting on Monday and letting our two days go in vain because being your admission officer I would want to make you understand the offer letter so that you as a family can have enough time to think about it.
03/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I do not mind connecting on Monday, but I would always want good for you so that you make the right decision in light of that, if you are not available to connect right now, we can even connect in the evening when the network gets better. So may I know if you would be available for 1 hour anytime from 08:00 pm to 09:30 pm?
03/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Ok Ma'am. I'm always available when network permits. So, I'll be on high alert for presence of network to communicate here. Thank you profusely Ma'am.
03/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome @263772112579 I hope to connect with you at 08:00 pm today.
03/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation. May I know if we can connect now to discuss the offer letter?
03/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 100 3606: Greetings ma'am my parents are out of network but they are keen to ask about the offer letter and they also have some questions about it.
03/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand that network can be a serious challenge. May I know if you are available for a discussion so that when they are available they can through the discussion and share their thoughts later on?
03/11/23, 11:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, since it is past our available hours now. I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 08:30 a.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!

04/11/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
04/11/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
04/11/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 211 2579: It is up to standard Ma'am. Thank you abundantly.
04/11/23, 11:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Have a great day and weekend ahead.
06/11/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Akatendeka.

I hope you are doing well. I hope you were able to go through the university insights by now and I am sure you must have questions to ask too, we can connect today at 08:00 pm, may I know if 08:00 pm today is suitable for you as well?
06/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can make progress and move ahead with the admission process?
06/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 389 8902: Greetings Madam .We are available
06/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
06/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 389 8902: Yes we discussed, and everyone of us is keen to push Akatendeka through regardless of Zimbabwe's challenging economy
06/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
06/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 389 8902: Apparently, Akatendeka is the first born in a family of four children.So when her three siblings were informed about her studies due to take place in India ,they were delighted and they promised to be supportive by means of foregoing some of their luxuries.That made life easy for us parents.We thought that if children could be so sacrificial for one of their own, then we must do more to help them all meet their goals.You may not have realised that a couple of days ago Akatendeka's WhatsApp status was about Galgotias .It's excitement galore.Therefore, we are working feverishly towards meeting the November 16th deadline for our first payment.
06/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That sounds truly heartwarming. It's incredibly touching when a family comes together like this, united in their support for one another's dreams and aspirations. Akatendeka's initiative to study abroad has clearly inspired her siblings to think beyond their immediate desires and contribute to a larger goal. Such solidarity can make all the difference in turning aspirations into reality.
06/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
06/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 389 8902: All is clear Ma'am. We can proceed. However, l remember the letter stated that we did not submit the A'level results. They must have been misplaced because we shared them on this platform. Can we resend them here, please?
06/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for noticing that and letting me know that. I believe it must have been a technical error from the side of the university, I have updated the team and they shall inform the university about the same since your A- level results are submitted.
06/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
06/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
06/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India.

06/11/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 16, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
06/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 389 8902: We can afford in two installments so , we are planning to beat the November 16th deadline for the first installment. This will do by getting in touch with the man in Harare whose contact details you shared here.This means that by December 16th we will complete the first of many payments we are going to make towards Akatendeka's education.
06/11/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.

This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
06/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Thank you Ma'am. Your guidelines have been duly noted. Thank you again for giving us this wonderful service. Good night.
14/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Akatendeka.

I hope you are doing well. As we can connect now I hope you understand the time-sensitive situation here since the offer letter is issued by the university and the deadline for the first part of your registration is after two days, I would really appreciate it if you could update us with a date before the deadline that you have in mind for the first part of the deposit?
14/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Greetings and good afternoon Ma'am. Indeed, this matter is uppermost over our priorities as a family. We're running around to put things in place. Actually, I was going to update tomorrow whether I fail to conjure up a plan; because I'm sure to be able to make the deposit on Fri the 17th.
14/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772112579 Thank you for your update, however, I hope you recall that the deadline for the offer letter is issued by the university, and the first deadline for Akatendeka's offer letter is the 16th of November 2023.
14/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 211 2579: I remember perfectly well and I'm doing all within my power to meet the deadline. Should things get out of hand, I'll inform you and we'll talk from then.
14/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand you are doing everything that is within your power since this opportunity is equally important for you as well, however, if you could help me understand the challenge that you are facing transparently it will really help me to assist you?
14/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 211 2579: In point of fact, I'm travelling to Harare tomorrow specifically for that bid.
14/11/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
14/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Ok Ma'am. The point is, I'm receiving my salary on Fri 17th. So, I'm negotiating with my friends to cover me up in order to meet the deadline of the 16th. Should they fail to bail me out, I'd update tomorrow, asking for a day's extension.
14/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 211 2579: I've read all the messages you posted Ma'am.
14/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand, however, I could certainly have a conversation with the Academic board about the same, before I do that I would want your confirmation that you will be able to pay the first part of the registration without fail on the 17th of November, since the deadlines are given by the university and if we have a conversation for an extension we are here trusting you as well, that you will not lead us down, so could you please confirm that for me?
14/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 211 2579: Ma'am, Akatendeka is my first-born child and I'm very serious about her education. On 17 November, I will, without fail, make the first payment of $321 including the 7% transaction fees. As I said above, I'm travelling to Harare tomorrow solely for this purpose.
14/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.
