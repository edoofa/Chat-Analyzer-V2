03/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 71 303 4263: 1 .. the inspiration for the scholarship was that it was a fantastic opportunity for me to pursue with my education.
03/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 71 303 4263: My insight and understanding is that it makes a huge difference for students who might not  otherwise be able to afford to go to college or university
03/01/24, 11:12 am - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
03/01/24, 11:12 am - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
03/01/24, 11:12 am - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

03/01/24, 3:47 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
03/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 71 303 4263: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 303 4263: Yes I'm confident....noticed
03/01/24, 3:49 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
03/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 71 303 4263: Not I didn't
03/01/24, 3:51 pm - Arshita: “Education is not the filling of a pot but the lighting of a fire.”– W.B. Yeats*
With my experience, I have come across many students who have a dream of studying abroad but fail to find a reliable source. They often fall for brokers/agents with no distant aim for future career. It may also be possible that you would have come across any University publicizing for Admissions from the UK, Australia, Poland, or even India. We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad. 

I hereby request you to go through this detailed article to compare your previous experiences if you had one. You can feel free to share the Name of the University you applied to or the Name of the Organization that offered you admission at any of the Universities. Let me know as soon as you have gone through and I will be guiding you through your program details.
