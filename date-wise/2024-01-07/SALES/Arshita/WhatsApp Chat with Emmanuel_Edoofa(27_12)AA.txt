For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/12/23, 2:08 pm - Arshita: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, a number of schools, educators and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.

Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of accounts?
29/12/23, 9:06 am - +265 984 40 73 15: No I don't.
29/12/23, 9:11 am - Arshita: That is fine. 

Have you completed MSCE examination?

29/12/23, 9:19 am - Arshita: Well noted
Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now,we accept upto 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregrate of 35,this would be the maxumum limit for eligibility.All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program

The minimum requirement was higher pre pandemic but during the pandemic a lot of students failed to recieve enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements has been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and perform well in MSCE!
29/12/23, 9:26 am - +265 984 40 73 15: I have confidence and I will perform perfect in MSCE
29/12/23, 9:31 am - Arshita: That is well noted
29/12/23, 9:31 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
29/12/23, 9:33 am - +265 984 40 73 15: I haven't
29/12/23, 9:34 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.

29/12/23, 10:56 am - +265 984 40 73 15: I have no any  research <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students

05/01/24, 1:25 pm - Arshita: Greetings!
05/01/24, 1:26 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
05/01/24, 1:52 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: India It have all I want to study for me to reach my goal.
05/01/24, 1:53 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
05/01/24, 1:55 pm - +265 995 56 13 00: Yes I have seen it and I have understood it
05/01/24, 1:56 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/01/24, 1:57 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 1:57 pm - Arshita: *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
05/01/24, 2:00 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: Yes it is affordable
05/01/24, 2:03 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
05/01/24, 2:04 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: I don't know
05/01/24, 2:08 pm - Arshita: Absolutely, Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable through the *Earn While You Learn Program*
05/01/24, 2:08 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/01/24, 2:08 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/01/24, 2:08 pm - Arshita: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
05/01/24, 2:14 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: Yes I will be benefiting

05/01/24, 2:18 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
05/01/24, 2:18 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
05/01/24, 2:18 pm - Arshita: *2.

Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
05/01/24, 2:18 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
05/01/24, 2:18 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker.

05/01/24, 2:26 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: Nice
05/01/24, 2:26 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/01/24, 2:27 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: My Parents
05/01/24, 2:29 pm - +265 995 56 13 00: 4&3
05/01/24, 2:29 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/01/24, 2:38 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: MY FATHER
05/01/24, 2:43 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with him after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
05/01/24, 2:46 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: They feel happy for me
05/01/24, 2:46 pm - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/01/24, 2:46 pm - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
05/01/24, 2:49 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: I don't know
05/01/24, 2:51 pm - Arshita: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/01/24, 2:51 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:51 pm - Arshita: To sum up, shall I inform you why and when the enrollment fee is paid?
05/01/24, 2:55 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: Yes
05/01/24, 2:55 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
05/01/24, 2:55 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/01/24, 2:58 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: Okay
05/01/24, 3:00 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
05/01/24, 3:03 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: Good
05/01/24, 3:04 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 3:07 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: 1,2 and 3
05/01/24, 3:08 pm - Arshita: We have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
05/01/24, 3:08 pm - Arshita: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
05/01/24, 3:08 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
05/01/24, 3:08 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
05/01/24, 3:11 pm - +265 984 40 73 15: Yes
05/01/24, 4:24 pm - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
05/01/24, 4:24 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.
