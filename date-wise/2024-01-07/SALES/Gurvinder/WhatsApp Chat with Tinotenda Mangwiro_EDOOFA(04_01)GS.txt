05/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 77 302 8247: We are herr
05/01/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Tinotenda, and Mr Mangwiro,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 77 302 8247: Noted Mr Gurvinder
05/01/24, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mr Mangwiro, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Takunda, is that correct?
05/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 302 8247: Yes
05/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Takunda, also do tell me whether you learnt about Takunda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
05/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 77 302 8247: Haaa just tell us how we go about it am at work and a bit busy to go back to all that
05/01/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program first.
05/01/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/01/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/01/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/01/24, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 302 8247: Yes interested where do we start from
05/01/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Mangwiro, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship? <This message was edited>

06/01/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Tinotenda I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
06/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 334 5929: Yes I'm already committed
06/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 334 5929: Studying abroad gives me experience to learn on new culture and way of life
06/01/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 334 5929: If I were to be given this opportunity, I would certainly want to contribute to the development of the education system in my home country. I would aim to do this in two ways. First, I would work to promote international education and exchange opportunities for students from my country. Second, I would use the knowledge and skills I gained during my studies abroad to improve the quality of education at home. I believe that by sharing my experiences and knowledge with others, I can make a positive impact on the future of education in my home country.
06/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tinotenda, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
06/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 334 5929: I completely agree with you! In order to make a meaningful contribution to my country's education system, I would need to first establish myself as a respected and knowledgeable professional in my field. And as you said, I would need a conducive environment to be able to study and work at my best. I believe that one of the most important factors in creating a conducive environment is having a reliable internet connection. That is why I am particularly interested in the Edoofa platform, as it provides students with the opportunity to access a reliable and fast internet connection while studying abroad.
06/01/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 77 334 5929: I am indeed curious as to why India is considered a good option for higher education. I understand that many African countries, like Zimbabwe, were indeed former British colonies, and I know that India also shares a similar history. However, despite this shared history, India has made remarkable progress in recent years, especially in the field of technology and education. I think that this progress is what makes India such a great option for higher education.
06/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
06/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*
