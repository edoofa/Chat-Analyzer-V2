Edoofa also have a scholarship program called earn while you learn(EWYL) which offers me scholarship credits.
I have learnt a lot from Israel's journey under the Edoofa scholarship program because he showed me some of the students who learnt at his school who have better career path and Israel put much effort on the scholarship which motivated me as well .Also he emphasized to me about the EWYL program.
