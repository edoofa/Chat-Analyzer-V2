*"The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all."*

*Happy New Year to you and your family.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
02/01/24, 10:42 am - +27 62 700 4023: Morning 

Happy New year
02/01/24, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: Let me now brief you about the program.
02/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
02/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
02/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
02/01/24, 5:05 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes it’s exactly what I’m looking for  especially the independent part
02/01/24, 8:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
03/01/24, 9:25 am - +27 62 700 4023: Morning 
How do we participate actively and engage in the program?
03/01/24, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Natalie, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
03/01/24, 10:08 am - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I’ll be able to do so
03/01/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Now Natalie, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
03/01/24, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
03/01/24, 4:28 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Okay I’ll do so wasn’t aware
04/01/24, 9:07 am - +27 62 700 4023: Morning can we start our sessions tomorrow we’ve had a major power cut in our area which leads to network disruptions
04/01/24, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/01/24, 7:01 am - +27 62 700 4023: My name is Natalie Makanakaishe Kurewa. I’m an 18 year old who’s very passionate about school in terms of academics. I absolutely love working under pressure. My highest education level is A level . I did a crash course for my A level I wrote sooner than expected. The course I’m looking forward to studying is mechatronics engineering or chemical engineering I’m stuck between these two though I’m really passionate about both. My dads an Accountant by profession and my moms a stay at home mom who does various things at different times. My dad’s highest level of education was university and my moms was O level. My dad has been supporting me for my education up until now but it hasn’t been consistent our relationship is not stable at all some months he would simply refuse to pay for my fees and I would end up just being at home. My extended family said they would try to make sure I have fees for my higher education as well as my sister because my dad is unpredictable. I have 2 siblings the first is an IT specialist and an author the second is a university student she’s now in her third year. For my last 2 years of highschool I went to a private institution whereby you’re able to have one on one lessons with a tutor since I was doing a crash course per month we payed $220 which meant per term it would be $660.
05/01/24, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/01/24, 11:06 am - +27 62 700 4023: I’ve sent the paragraph you had requested
05/01/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you, Natalie.
05/01/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
05/01/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
05/01/24, 11:48 am - +27 62 700 4023: Brett Kandonzvo.vcf (file attached)
05/01/24, 11:50 am - +27 62 700 4023: That’s Mr brett
05/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study mechatronics engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
05/01/24, 12:15 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Before I even decided to do this degree what made me to even look into the engineering field was because I wanted to be something different in my family there are a lot of lawyers and doctors and by nature other people tell their kids to walk the same path they walked because they know they’ll succeed since they did the same . As for me I want to walk my own path and discover everything that I can and explore and figure out life by myself not to be given a journey to walk on a golden platter. That’s how I decided I want to go for engineering. What motivated me to choose mechatronics engineering specifically was because of my love for computers and electrical stuff so this degree is a combination of that it ventures into electromechanical systems which is deeper
05/01/24, 12:33 pm - +27 62 700 4023: +27 61 279 7799
05/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Your determination to chart your own course is truly inspiring. It takes courage to venture into a field different from the familiar paths in your family. The blend of computer science and electrical components in mechatronics engineering perfectly aligns with your passion and curiosity for technology.
05/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
05/01/24, 12:42 pm - +27 62 700 4023: No one has pursued the exact degree but one of my cousins has done chemical engineering
05/01/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Natalie, as you told that you depend on your elder sister for higher education, don't you think, she should be a part of this session?
05/01/24, 1:04 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I do but she would like it to follow under my mom
05/01/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
05/01/24, 1:29 pm - +27 62 700 4023: I’ll do so
05/01/24, 1:55 pm - +27 62 700 4023: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Are these Grade 12 results?
05/01/24, 2:01 pm - +27 62 700 4023: These are o level results my A levels are yet to come out
05/01/24, 2:01 pm - +27 62 700 4023: In South Africa this is equivalent to grade 12 though
05/01/24, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share you A-level subjects then?
05/01/24, 4:03 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Mathematics, geography and chemistry
05/01/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: May I know that why did you not take Physics as a subject if you wanted to Mechatronics Engineering?
05/01/24, 4:06 pm - +27 62 700 4023: I decided to not take physics because in terms of maths I did mechanics which is actually physics so my maths was branched into mechanics and statistics so I felt like doing physics would’ve been too much pressure
06/01/24, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*I would like to inform you that today's session is only till 1.30 PM CAT*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
06/01/24, 10:35 am - +27 62 700 4023: Morning have you seen this response?
06/01/24, 11:36 am - Gurvinder: Please, I have read this, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student wants to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
06/01/24, 12:09 pm - +27 62 700 4023: What if it’s chemical engineering
06/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: I noticed that you also had an intereset in Computer Science, may I know what do you think about that?
06/01/24, 12:22 pm - +27 62 700 4023: Yes I would also take it as it connects with softwares and electronics
06/01/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Computer Application*
