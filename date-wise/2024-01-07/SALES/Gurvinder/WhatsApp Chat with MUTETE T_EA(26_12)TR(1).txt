29/12/23, 11:12 am - Tushti: Now, let me brief you about the course you are eligible for

29/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: I believe it would eb a part of the syllabus

I could also work for a government organization, such as the Reserve Bank of India or the National Payments Corporation of India.I would probably be in data analysis, finance and software management...I could help the above organizations make better decisions by analyzing and interpreting data, and l could play a key role in the development and implementation of new technologies.As l progress, l could work as an independent contractor or have my own consulting firm.l would have many options in helping like banking, consulting, healthcare, government, retail, and manufacturing and l would like to participate in business intelligence, supply chain management or security.
29/12/23, 1:28 pm - Tushti: That is really great, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
29/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Counsellor No Offense...I Would Like "Do What It Takes" Percent...I Just Want A Base To Start Then My Father Always Told Me "To Get Anything, You Must Work Very Tireless"

29/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 831 3472: I will take any pill to make sure my career's plan has gone as l wish
29/12/23, 1:56 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 831 3472: I want to be in the business field and Zimbabwe has political and economic stability...It really is a very bad environment to someone who want to study business like me...There are also lack of resources to help me deepen my studies... In Zimbabwe, there are no excellent practical institutions like stable banks that you can go and experience something...Above all, l just want to go out of the country to gain new experiences from countries with one of the most solid economies which would suit my programs
29/12/23, 2:25 pm - Tushti: Wonderful
29/12/23, 2:25 pm - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
29/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 831 3472: I meant economic instability
29/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 831 3472: There are a number of reasons why l want to study in India. First, India has a rich cultural and historical heritage, making it a fascinating place to live and study. Second, India is home to some of the world's leading universities, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Management. Third, India offers a relatively low cost of living compared to many other countries, making.Fourth, India is a fast-growing economy with many opportunities for graduates in fields like engineering, finance, and technology.The Indian education system is vast and diverse, with both public and private institutions. At the primary and secondary level, the education system is mostly public, with a mix of state-run and government-aided schools. At the post-secondary level, there are a wide range of options, including public universities, private universities, technical institutes, and vocational schools. There is also a significant amount of distance learning and online education available. English is widely used as the medium of instruction in the education system, though Hindi and other regional languages are also used in some areas.
29/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 831 3472: The Indian education system is also characterized by its focus on examinations. Grades are very important, and students must pass high-stakes exams in order to advance to the next level of schooling. This system of exams has both benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, it ensures that students are well-prepared for the rigors of university and the workplace. On the other hand, it can lead to a "rote learning" style of education, where students memorize facts and information without truly understanding or engaging with the material. The university system in India is quite unique. There are a large number of universities, both public and private, spread throughout the country. Many of the top universities are affiliated with one of the two major national universities, the University of Delhi and the University of Mumbai. Admission to universities is typically based on performance on the national entrance exams, such as the Joint Entrance Examination or the Common Admission Test. Once admitted, students typically have a great deal of flexibility in choosing their courses and majors.
29/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 831 3472: The Indian education system can help me achieve my goals in a number of ways. First, it provides a strong foundation in the core subjects. Second, it offers a wide range of elective courses that can help you explore your interests and develop your skills. Third, it offers opportunities for internships and work experience, which can be valuable in pursuing your career goals. Finally, it provides connections to the Indian job market, which is growing rapidly and offers many opportunities for skilled and educated individuals. 😊
29/12/23, 2:39 pm - Tushti: Very well researched. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:
29/12/23, 2:39 pm - Tushti: 1. Robust Education System: India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

04/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 78 831 3472: Okay

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
04/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 78 831 3472: Good Morning Mr Gurvinder...How Are You
04/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
04/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words NAME what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Oh Wow Mr Singh...Thank You For The Education...EDOOFA Really Offers A Chance...
04/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 78 831 3472: You reduce the cost while really offering high quality education...That's wonderful...
04/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
05/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 831 3472: Yeah you can please...
05/01/24, 9:58 am - +263 78 831 3472: Good Morning Everyone
05/01/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: @263788313472 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
05/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Okay Thank You Sir...Afternoon Mr Singh...How Can l Process For That...
05/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 831 3472: It looks like it gives me experience as l learn...
05/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

05/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Yeah, that's a great way to go...l can see that
05/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @263788313472 , moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Yeah, according to my own perspective, these webinars are a great motive because they offer a tangible and forseeable insight to me...It also offers a driving force because l will be able to see those who have succeeded  therefore giving me an "it can be done" insight...  In general, webinars can be a great way to learn new information, get inspired, or network with like-minded individuals. They're usually free or low-cost, and they can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.
05/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 831 3472: For Example, Look At That Webinar From Yasmin Bitugu...It Engineers Me As A Student So That I Can Be A Beast In The Industry After University... It Will Mould Me Into A Student Who Will Be Able To Fit In The Industrial Environment...
05/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Okay Thank You Mr Singh... You Are Just A Great Teacher...l Am Understanding Everything And Its Clear That This Program Reduces Cost Burdens For The Family...
05/01/24, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
05/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Wow Thank You Sir Gurvinder...This Is A Great Motive...
05/01/24, 1:59 pm - +263 78 831 3472: This Is What I Always Dreamt Of...And I Can See EDOOFA Can Mould Me Into A Great Person In The Industry...
05/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263788313472 , now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
05/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Yes Sir Gurvinder, they will be supporting me...
05/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
05/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Yeah l did...
05/01/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Yes, l am...
05/01/24, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: @263788313472 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 78 831 3472: From $1500 to $2250
05/01/24, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly @263788313472 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/01/24, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 831 3472: So $750 for application of how many universities
05/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Please, it is $350 for 5-7 universities.
05/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Okay so for applying for 5 to seven universities is $350...
05/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Yeah, so basically its all $350...
05/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: @263788313472 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
05/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
05/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Okay, firstly my Advanced Level Result Is Already Out...
05/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 831 3472: And when and what is the eligibility test...
05/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please, this is to give you a general idea, and the eligibilty test will be held in the eligibility check evaluation.
05/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 78 831 3472: So after the eligibility test, l will receive the reservation letter
05/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
05/01/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 831 3472: No Sir, l am not
05/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 831 3472: So you don't know when is the eligibility test
05/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263788313472 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Yeah
05/01/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Please, it will be when you reach the eligibility check evaluation stage.
05/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Okay Sir
05/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Okay understood
05/01/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/01/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
05/01/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
