I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
03/01/24, 10:36 am - +260 97 1815514: It's a program that offers help to people by offering them scholarships in order for them to further their studies and be able to undertake the career pathway they desire
03/01/24, 10:52 am - +260 97 1815514: Good morning you sir
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
03/01/24, 12:50 pm - +260 97 1815514: Yes so that it can be easy for them to be able to support my family because of the scholarship i have and so that they can spend less money on me and be able to help others in the family who need to go to school as well and so that in as much as i am furthering my education it does not become that much of a burden on my sponsors because of the percentage of scholarship rendered to me and help with the little money i can earn during the time I'm at Edoofa and be able to help others as well as myself
03/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Elizabeth, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
03/01/24, 1:04 pm - +260 97 1815514: Yes i think i can with the effort my guardians and i are putting forth in order for me to be able to make it and be accepted at Edoofa
03/01/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now Elizabeth, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

04/01/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Elizabeth, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
04/01/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

04/01/24, 10:31 am - +260 97 5387220: Sorry pediatricians
04/01/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: Please I am informing you that to get a course in the health sector, you need Physics, Maths, and Chemistry as individual subjects, so the the courses stated below are the following that you can choose from.

04/01/24, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why do you not go for Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, as that aligns with your interest of becoming a paediatrician?
04/01/24, 12:25 pm - +260 97 1815514: I chose bachelor of science in physiotherapy because i have also noticed that there are alot of children born with alot of complications especially with bones were some of them are born with deformed bones and i think i can be of help to them after undergoing the required training
04/01/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
04/01/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: As per the eligibility criteria,  In order to help the students get a quality education and a good quantum of  scholarship, Students should clear the following aspects:

04/01/24, 1:01 pm - +260 97 5387220: Noted sir
04/01/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
04/01/24, 1:12 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes sir
04/01/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.
04/01/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.
04/01/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*

04/01/24, 1:43 pm - +260 97 5387220: Noted sir thank you very much for that information
04/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
04/01/24, 1:48 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes sir I'm now very clear about the course
04/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/01/24, 3:08 pm - +260 97 1815514: I can start working immediately provided a job is given to me after completing my studies.I can try to save a bit of money so that even as much as i am working in the public or private sector i am employed in, i can be able to open an institution that teaches about healthy living lifestyles that should later not affect people's movement in the future and as they age and can be offered massages and encouraged to do alot of exercises and encouraging them on how to deal with certain conditions that can affect their health especially their bones and muscles. One that helps those that have movement problems caused by accidents, diseases that they may have suffered from, disorders that they may have been born with or  recently had them due to injury or other factors that might have affected their movements in any way. If i get into Edoofa's program it can help me achieve my dreams by offering me a scholarship that can make it very easy for me to further my studies and make it possible for me to do this course and be able to achieve my future goals
04/01/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Elizabeth I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
04/01/24, 3:20 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes i am very willing
04/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 97 5387220: Because other countries are more developed as compared to my country and i know that if i study from another country i maybe able to see how other countries are developed and also try my best to help my country when I'm back and also contribute to it's development in one way or another
04/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/01/24, 4:03 pm - +260 97 5387220: I can help by teaching my fellow workers what i have learned and them teaching me what they have learned and we can all put our knowledge and thinking together and we can at least form a Non governmental organisation that is aimed at educating people on ways we can help in contributing to our country's economy and well being. Especially the younger generation for they are the future leaders of tomorrow.
05/01/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/01/24, 10:04 am - +260 97 5387220: Morning sir
05/01/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Elizabeth, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
05/01/24, 10:31 am - +260 97 5387220: Yes i do
05/01/24, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
05/01/24, 11:21 am - +260 97 5387220: Yes why
05/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
05/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

05/01/24, 12:50 pm - +260 97 5387220: What these people have achieved is so motivating and i would like to be like them
05/01/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: So now Elizabeth, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
05/01/24, 1:07 pm - +260 97 5387220: So is it that once you are given a scholarship to go study from india if you are from another country you are given a family to stay with or the university has it's own boarding houses in which students are expected to stay in
05/01/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the University has its own affordable accommodations inside the campus.
05/01/24, 1:11 pm - +260 97 5387220: Alright noted
05/01/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
05/01/24, 1:18 pm - +260 97 5387220: No
05/01/24, 1:22 pm - +260 97 1815514: But we have heard saying it's expensive without a scholarship
05/01/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/01/24, 1:41 pm - +260 97 5387220: Thanks noted
05/01/24, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
05/01/24, 1:44 pm - +260 97 5387220: Sure sir
05/01/24, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Elizabeth, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
05/01/24, 1:53 pm - +260 97 5387220: That's so good and helpful to the students
05/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

05/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/01/24, 2:30 pm - +260 97 5387220: I also think that my life can change after i complete and i think this will benefit me alot
05/01/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Elizabeth, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 2:43 pm - +260 97 5387220: That's so fantastic
05/01/24, 2:44 pm - +260 97 5387220: It's really great on the student's part
05/01/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/01/24, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
05/01/24, 3:05 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes i do realise the difference between you and other institutions
05/01/24, 3:07 pm - +260 97 5387220: Because your way of doing things is a bit different like the earn while you learn program
05/01/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Elizabeth, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
05/01/24, 3:08 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes
05/01/24, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
05/01/24, 3:17 pm - +260 97 1815514: Yes
05/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 3:22 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes
05/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Elizabeth as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/01/24, 3:28 pm - +260 97 5387220: About 1500-2250 US dollars
05/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Elizabeth, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 97 5387220: That's amazing and affordable
05/01/24, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 3:38 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes i do
05/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
05/01/24, 3:45 pm - +260 97 5387220: That's so good and considerate of you
05/01/24, 3:46 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes sir
05/01/24, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/01/24, 3:47 pm - +260 97 5387220: Not yet
05/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Elizabeth, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
05/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/01/24, 3:50 pm - +260 97 5387220: Am now very clear sir thank you
05/01/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/01/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
05/01/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/01/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
05/01/24, 3:53 pm - +260 97 5387220: No i now understand
05/01/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
05/01/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/01/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.

06/01/24, 9:45 am - Gurvinder: Hello @260971815514 @260975387220.

06/01/24, 10:12 am - +260 97 1815514: Yes
06/01/24, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
06/01/24, 10:23 am - +260 97 1815514: Yes
06/01/24, 10:23 am - +260 97 5387220: Yes
06/01/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: So @260971815514, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @260975387220 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

Are you clear about the same?
06/01/24, 11:21 am - +260 97 1815514: Thank you sir , Initially my young sister Elizabeth Litwai wanted to study pediatric but  due to some circumstances beyond she opted to study Physiotherapy
She wants to study in india, the average cost is 6000-8000 US dollars and the annual fee paid if eligible for the program is 2000-3000 US dollars per year and the enrollment fee is 350 US dollars in 7 days. 
The Earn While You Learn program is a program that gives an opportunity to the students to earn credits while still actually doing their studies and this can help them reduce on their fees and be able to pay less because the credits they earn is added to their fees and this makes it very affordable for easy payment of fees without having to worry much about the high fees it helps them reduce on their budgets and be able to help themselves with what they need. 
Yes we are clear scholarship
06/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: *@260971815514*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.

06/01/24, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Elizabeth's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
06/01/24, 11:35 am - +260 97 1815514: Okay noted sir

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *12th or 13th of January 2024* for $200 and the *12th or 13th of February 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *12th or 13th of January 2024*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Its main aim was to investigate the impact of war, genocide and other potentially traumatic experiences on genocide survivors on the one hand and former prisoners on the other hand, as well as the respective descendants of both groups. The study also examined correlates of PTSD and the prediction of the PTSD symptom severity. In general, survivors and their descendants reported more traumatic events and proved to be more affected than families of former prisoners. Posttraumatic stress reactions were especially elevated in adult survivors who had experienced a high number of traumatic events, had poor physical health and were lacking in social integration.
