I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
04/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 78 115 8087: Okay Mr Gurvinder ,this is the right person
04/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Joel,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program
04/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 115 8087: Okay thank you, it's a pleasure connecting with you too
04/01/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Joel, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tariro, is that correct?
04/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 115 8087: Yes it is correct
04/01/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tariro, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tariro’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 115 8087: Okay I learnt that Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Tariro also said that the  Edoofa program with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.
04/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 115 8087: Stays*
04/01/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 115 8087: Tariro didn't say much about her travel experience
04/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you more about the program.
04/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 115 8087: Okay
04/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/01/24, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 78 115 8087: It is sir
04/01/24, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Joel, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 78 115 8087: Yes, I do sir
04/01/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now Joel, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

05/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 115 8087: Thank you sir
05/01/24, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: Joel, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
05/01/24, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
05/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 115 8087: Okay sir
05/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 115 8087: I didn't know I would need physics
05/01/24, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: So may i know, which subject you want to go ahead with?
05/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 115 8087: Number 4
05/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*BSc Cardiovascular Technology*
05/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 115 8087: Yes, Mr Gurvinder that is correct
05/01/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
05/01/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
05/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 115 8087: I'm confident sir
05/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course? <This message was edited>
