12/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mr Benjamin Jimu,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 670 6008: OK thanks
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Yeah ,its the right person .,how are u Sir..
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Ok ,Endoofa scholarship program is ,an Indian organisation which ,offers scholarships to needy , children ..,
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you about the program.
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Yeah ,that's true sir ..
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Gabrile, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Yeah, I think so sir .,
12/12/23, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now Gabrile, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
12/12/23, 6:28 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

“Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
18/12/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 670 6008: Fyn en you sir
18/12/23, 9:43 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
18/12/23, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
18/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 975 9914: Oh ,really
18/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 975 9914: Yeah, sure sir
18/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 975 9914: I'll try my best..,but I'm sure that I can achieve maximum points
18/12/23, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Great, So shall I brief you about the course?
18/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 975 9914: Sure sir
18/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.
18/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.
18/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.
18/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: The subjects included in B.com program are as following:

*Accountancy*
*Cost Account*
*Statistics*
*Management*
*Human Resource*
*Computer*
*Economics*
*English*
*Law*
*Marketing*

18/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: After being awarded the B.Com degree, candidates can either look for jobs in various departments or opt for higher education.
18/12/23, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Com graduates can pursue post-graduation courses such as M.Com (Master of Commerce), MBA (Master of Business Administration), CA (Chartered Accountant), CS (Company Secretary), Actuarial Scientist, and ACCA (Association of Chartered Accountants).*
18/12/23, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Com graduates have a plethora of job positions in government as well as private sectors to choose from provided that they are not limited to careers in accounts and finance*
18/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Ok ,I understand sir .,
18/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 975 9914: So these ,are the subjects that I will be doing ..,
18/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Oh nice to hear that..
18/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
18/12/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Yeah I understand sir .,
18/12/23, 5:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 7:28 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Oh ok , As I said before  ,I was born in , a poor family struggling to survive .But success have been part of my daily ,prayers. I always dream of being a great person , and that is only through education .

I think , if God bless then ,I get to , pass my Advanced level with maximum points , then, also successfully get an Edoofa scholarship for tertiary education overseas ,Then contact my B.com programe till ,completion and become employable .I would like to opt for any Job , that is directly linked ,to my course ,like Banking ,Marketing or finance . This will help me to raise and break the chains of poverty in our family . As time goes and as I'll be getting an increase in financial security I'll also ,channel some of the finance ,into other income generating projects like ,piggery ,broiler keeping  ,layers and other agro .projects .I would also develop into an entrepreneur ., being involved in supermarkets ,night clubs butcheries and even building feeling stations ,( i.e there is a deficity of these activities in our area ) so I'll be taking that opportunity to ,raise..

So ,Edoofa scholarship program ,will ..,be the backbone of all ,these ideas of mine ,being my ,financial supporter .To achieve higher education and become employable .
18/12/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 975 9914: So ,in short I'd like to .,to opt for a job ,either in India or Zimbabwe ,then began to build my entreprenueral foundation .,So that 5 years after my completion of my course ,I'll be someone ,among others .Having better shelter ,improving my family's standards of living ,so as to having operating  ,Small Business like ,being involved in transport ( min busses ,🚌) and thus all about generating income and revenue..

If possible I'd also like to join the body of Edoofa scholarship program ,so as to rescue those ,children whose are academically talented but , couldn't show up due to lack of financial security

19/12/23, 9:40 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Gabrile I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
19/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 975 9914: Yes ,I'm willing sir.

19/12/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
19/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 975 9914: Oh ok , I think studying abroad is ,much better because I would not be experiencing ,disturbances so I'll only be focusing on my school work .,rather than studying domestically there will be ,a lot of disturbances and factors which will lead to failure . Also it's been part of my dreams to study abroad .
19/12/23, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell me that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
19/12/23, 8:34 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

20/12/23, 7:43 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

26/12/23, 8:47 am - ~ Mr TooSweety,😜😜 changed this group's icon
26/12/23, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: It was great, how was yours?
26/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 975 9914: It's was good too..
26/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Gabrile, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
26/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 975 9914: I agree ,sir
26/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
26/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 975 9914: Yes sir,can you please share the reason with me
26/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
26/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

4. *Faculty Expertise:* Skilled faculty bring real-world expertise to the classroom, guiding your academic journey.

26/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: So now Gabrile, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
26/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 975 9914: Oh ,ok sir I just want to ,know  how far am I now ,with this session .., and also as to your point of view ,with your experience with me through out these sessions , do I qualify for this .,
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Oh ,sir I forgot to tell that ,is me on the ,group icon ..pic
26/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Please do not worry about that, I just want you to finish the counselling session today so that we can fast track your application.
26/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, I noticed.
26/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Oh ok ,so I've no more questions to ask
26/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Ok
26/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
26/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Unmm, I can say no ..,but from my researches I heard that ,the cost ,is too high ,to aford
26/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Gabrile what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Oh, ok I can understand sir .,
26/12/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
26/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Sure sir
26/12/23, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: Gabrile, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in. <This message was edited>

26/12/23, 4:34 pm - Gurvinder: So you are saying even after the scholarship and the EWYL program, your parent cannot support you for your higher education?
26/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Yeah ,I can say yes ,because I'm just an orphan ,staying with my step mom and my Sibling brother ,and even for my high school I was being supported by someone whose not even my relative ,and I'm not sure if she can agree to continue supporting me for abroad high education
26/12/23, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, so you do not want to continue?
26/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 975 9914: No , I wish to continue sir. Can you do me a favour..of being a totally Edoofa beneficiary 🙏🙏🥺🥺 please
26/12/23, 5:07 pm - Gurvinder: Gabrile, even if you manage to get 100% scholarship, how are you planning to pay for food, accommodation, and basic living expenses?
26/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Unmm , for that I'll try to manage sir
26/12/23, 5:12 pm - Gurvinder: Gabrile, I need to know how, as I cannot enroll a student and then when he comes to India, he can manage to live here.
26/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Ok ,I've my uncle whose a policemen , so I talked to him and he agreed to help ,
26/12/23, 5:16 pm - Gurvinder: Gabrile, that is fine, but I cannot assure you that you will get 100% scholarship.
26/12/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Oh, ok but I wish to get a minimum of 95%
26/12/23, 5:23 pm - Gurvinder: Gabrile, the only thing that I can assure you is a scholarship between 50% to 100%.
26/12/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Oh ok ,it's alright sir
26/12/23, 9:17 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

27/12/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 975 9914: Morning sir ,
27/12/23, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
27/12/23, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
27/12/23, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*

27/12/23, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
27/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 975 9914: Of course ,I'll benefit a lot sir 🥺🥺
27/12/23, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Gabrile, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 975 9914: Ooh that, have become very clear..,I understand sir
27/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
27/12/23, 7:55 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
