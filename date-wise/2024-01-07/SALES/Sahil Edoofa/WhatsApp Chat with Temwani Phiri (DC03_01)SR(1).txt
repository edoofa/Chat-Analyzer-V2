04/01/24, 12:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/01/24, 12:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.
After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.*

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

04/01/24, 3:12 pm - +260 96 7387729: Yes I have
04/01/24, 3:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please share with me ?
04/01/24, 3:24 pm - +260 96 7387729: The following are some of the criteria I have researched on:
Academic requirements, language proficiency for non-English speaking countries, letters of recommendation, personal statement,entrance exams such as the MCAT, research experience, clinical experience and visa requirements
04/01/24, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: As you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very expensive course even after scholarship as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that. (Annually cost after scholarship is some where around $35000 to $45000 per year)

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-10 years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue

So are your parents for this or they are looking more a more affordable course ?
04/01/24, 3:56 pm - +260 96 7387729: Yes my parents are for this
04/01/24, 4:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you discussed this with your family?
