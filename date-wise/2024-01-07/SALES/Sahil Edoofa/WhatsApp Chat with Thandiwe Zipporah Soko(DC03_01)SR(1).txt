04/01/24, 12:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/01/24, 12:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.
After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.*

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

04/01/24, 2:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself. 
So, could you kindly tell me who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
04/01/24, 2:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: As we start your counseling, remember Edoofa offers 50-100% scholarships. To increase your chances:

Be actively engaged in the counseling.
Ensure your parents participate.
Successful applicants with over 80% scholarships had involved parents and were proactive during the process.
04/01/24, 2:31 pm - +260 96 9573792: Her mother who works as a sales representative at Zambia state insurance company and also does a small business (selling good second hand clothes), the grandmother (retiree) and me (the aunty) am a teacher by profession
04/01/24, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Will your Aunt and grandmother support you for your tertiary education ?
04/01/24, 2:33 pm - +260 96 9573792: Are we also allowed so respond to the questions that are being asked.....or will there be specific questions for parents?
04/01/24, 2:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Anyone can respond
04/01/24, 2:51 pm - +260 96 9573792: Okay thank you
04/01/24, 3:06 pm - +260 96 9573792: This will be challenging, because tertiary education is more expensive than high school. We have been discussing on this and how we can raise money for her once the results are out.....but it has not been easy.....as we are hoping for 100% scholarship. 

But we would try to raise something though not sure of the amount, and finances don't easily come by so this would take a lot of time for the economy is not very much stable right now.
04/01/24, 3:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What is the monthly budget you have made for your child education considering if you want her to get best quality education which will lead her to employbility?
04/01/24, 3:40 pm - +260 96 9573792: This is when we are starting to save because her previous school was a bit expensive plus her brothers. We are starting to save this January k500 monthly...atleast this will try and help us to start from somewhere.
04/01/24, 3:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you managed to calculate the cost of basic university in Africa ?
04/01/24, 7:36 pm - +260 96 9573792: No, this is when we are going to start inquirying (within Zambia).
04/01/24, 8:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 8:17 pm - +260 96 9573792: Alright thank you very much
04/01/24, 10:25 pm - +260 760859514: Alright
04/01/24, 10:38 pm - +260 96 2906094: Thank you
05/01/24, 10:04 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning
How are you doing today?
05/01/24, 11:05 am - +260 760859514: Good thanks ,how are you?
05/01/24, 11:48 am - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
05/01/24, 11:48 am - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through this video ?
05/01/24, 11:49 am - Sahil Edoofa: Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Africa for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zambia,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zambia is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/01/24, 12:39 pm - +260 96 9573792: We agree....its very expensive. Today i actually got to find out at one of the universities in Zambia called Texila American University.....per semester they pay k20,000
05/01/24, 12:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How are you planning to meet the finances ?
05/01/24, 1:12 pm - +260 96 9573792: Well, the same way we use to source for her secondary is the same way we will try to raise the funds.....like we said, it would be very challenging cause tertiary education is expensive. The fact is that, we would not let her stay without going to the university......if no scholarship will come through...we will ask her to choose a different course that we can manage....and this will definitely be our last option. Otherwise this is why we are here, in this group, so that you can best help us out with the scholarship.
05/01/24, 1:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you aware of the cost of Education abroad ?
05/01/24, 1:29 pm - +260 96 9573792: No, but we know it's expensive. If possible Kindly share the costs of education abroad.....since you have an idea.
05/01/24, 1:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 1:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Kindly go through this document once.
05/01/24, 1:41 pm - +260 96 9573792: We thought this platform is supposed to help us get a scholarship for Zipporah....but we have noticed that you are only asking us how the funds will be raised.....of which i feel we have explained almost everything. And what i know is that you are supposed to tell us how to go about it and what is needed, etc... who qualifies for a 50% and who qualifies for a 100% scholarship.
05/01/24, 1:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Inform me once you are done
05/01/24, 4:11 pm - +260 96 9573792: Done
05/01/24, 5:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please share your understanding ?
05/01/24, 5:29 pm - +260 96 9573792: 1. That 50-100% scholarship is only for tuition fees
2. Necessities are supposed to be provided by the guardians
3. Enrollment fee should be paid by us.
4. Registration fee should be paid by us
5. Visa fees should be paid by us as well.
6. Earn while you learn is provided (earning scholarship credits and not cash or salary)
05/01/24, 6:03 pm - +260 96 9573792: That's my understanding. Correct me if am wrong.
06/01/24, 10:55 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
06/01/24, 11:50 am - +260 96 9573792: Good morning...fine thank you and how are you?
06/01/24, 11:51 am - +260 760859514: Good thanks, how are you?
06/01/24, 11:51 am - +260 96 2906094: Good morning
06/01/24, 12:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I hope all your questions were cleared and now you have a better clarity of the program.
06/01/24, 12:39 pm - +260 96 9573792: Yes i do
06/01/24, 12:42 pm - +260 96 9573792: Though am just not very sure about accomodation. I need clarity on that.
06/01/24, 1:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you go through the cost of Education abroad?
06/01/24, 2:51 pm - +260 96 9573792: Yes we did...As much as we would want her to study abroad... it's extremely expensive without the help of a scholarship. If you only offer this type of scholarship were we have to pay for her accommodation etc....then it's better she gets a scholarship thts within our Country (Zambia) which we can afford
