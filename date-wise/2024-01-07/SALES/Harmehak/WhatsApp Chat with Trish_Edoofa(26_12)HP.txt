28/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 78 190 1631: Tanzania
28/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Alright please
28/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: I believe he has been following the discussion so you request him to participate.
28/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 190 1631: Sure,
28/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
28/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 190 1631: But I’m an ordinary level graduate
28/12/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: You completed O level when please?
28/12/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 190 1631: This year
28/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: So you are yet to receive your O level results?
28/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 190 1631: Yes
28/12/23, 11:39 am - Harmehak: Alright Trish
28/12/23, 11:39 am - Harmehak: You happened to mention your year of A level as 2024

May I know more about the same?
28/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 190 1631: Well I don’t want to do my A level here I want to study there for my A level or I’d like to get an exam for my admission and study law
28/12/23, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Trish.

So are you aware that you would be proceeding ahead on the basis of a Diploma right after O level?
28/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 190 1631: Yes
28/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Duly noted

28/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 190 1631: **

Never,
28/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright
28/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 190 1631: The problem is I can’t speak right from head when arguing I need time to figure out the points to bring when arguing and write them down
28/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: That's understandable, 

I am glad you are thoroughly aware of your strengths and weakness.
28/12/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: You see since right after O level, you can pursue Diploma itself, So students firstly pursue Diploma in Business Administration after the same you pursue Bachelors in Business Administration - Legislative Law.

As Law is a Bachelor's degree and can be pursued After A level or Diploma.

So are you prepared to do the same?
28/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 190 1631: * 
Yes but how long does it take
28/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: The Diploma is of three years, Trish.
28/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 190 1631: What about studying law
28/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Law is a 5 year degree please
28/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 190 1631: So it’d be 8 years right?
28/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 190 1631: So is it possible to take a break and go back home?

02/01/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: To pursue Bachelors, A level or Diploma after O level is required.

You see since right after O level, you can pursue Diploma itself, So students firstly pursue Diploma in Business Administration after the same you pursue Bachelors in Business Administration - Legislative Law.

As Law is a Bachelor's degree and can be pursued After A level or Diploma.

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 78 190 1631: Thank you 

The main reason is that I believe the education here is nothing in comparison to the education there <This message was edited>
02/01/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: You see, Trish, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
02/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 190 1631: Sure thing
02/01/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Trish.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

My friends always tell me that if I want to study law then India is the best nation for that coarse hence i chose India for that matter
02/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

02/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 190 1631: Noted!
02/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through the shared resources, Trish?
02/01/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 190 1631: I did
02/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: What all did you learn from the shared resources, Trish?
02/01/24, 1:59 pm - +263 78 190 1631: India gives the best education and enables students to fulfill their dreams in great ways
02/01/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 78 190 1631: ..

No
02/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
02/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
02/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 78 190 1631: I have no objections
02/01/24, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: Trish, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 190 1631: I would..
02/01/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Trish?
02/01/24, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation
02/01/24, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
02/01/24, 10:17 pm - +263 78 190 1631: Sure
03/01/24, 9:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 78 190 1631: Yes
03/01/24, 9:48 am - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Trish?
03/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 190 1631: I think I can understand everything but I can’t give a summary of what I understand
03/01/24, 9:53 am - Harmehak: However my question was if after comparing the costs in Zimbabwe and India,

Are you able to realise how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
03/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 78 190 1631: Yes,
03/01/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
03/01/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
03/01/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/01/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

03/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 78 190 1631: Noted!
03/01/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 190 1631: Alright,
03/01/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/01/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
03/01/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 190 1631: I can understand
03/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the video along with other shared resources, Trish?
03/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 78 190 1631: Yes
03/01/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
03/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 78 190 1631: Yes
03/01/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Trish, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
03/01/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 78 190 1631: *$1500-$2250?*
03/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 190 1631: It’s very clear
03/01/24, 10:55 am - Harmehak: You see Trish, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
03/01/24, 10:56 am - +263 78 190 1631: I think so
03/01/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Thats amazing!
03/01/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their O-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final O level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
03/01/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 78 190 1631: Sure thing
03/01/24, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
03/01/24, 11:01 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
03/01/24, 11:01 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 190 1631: Alright
03/01/24, 11:06 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the discussion so far, Trish?
03/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 78 190 1631: Yes I have
03/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
03/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
03/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

03/01/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
03/01/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

03/01/24, 11:15 am - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth too, Trish.
03/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 78 190 1631: I’ll do so
03/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries for me, Trish?
03/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 190 1631: No
03/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Duly noted
03/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
03/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
03/01/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

03/01/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
03/01/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: Have a blessed day ahead <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Trish and parents, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
04/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 190 1631: Yes, let’s proceed
We got no questions
04/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: Sure please, Trish!

How was your discussion with the family and what all did you discuss?
04/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 78 190 1631: The discussion was good, and we discussed all about the advantages of studying in India, how we going to arrange for the money

04/01/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: I am glad you all had a detailed discussion.
04/01/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
04/01/24, 10:56 am - +263 78 190 1631: We didn’t have a word with her but my family believes that the program is very much helpful therefore, they want me to be part of the Edoofa program
04/01/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: While I do appreciate, Trish.

May I know why you all couldn't connect with Mrs Ruth?
04/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 78 190 1631: We thought there’s no need since we can understand everything now
04/01/24, 11:04 am - Harmehak: I can understand,

However, considering she is a parent herself who have two daughters currently in India,

Your parents would have a greater relief regarding everything!
04/01/24, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)_*The cause of poverty is extravagant _*
b)Stingy habits of the poor .

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)*Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.*
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)*Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.*
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means

04/01/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
04/01/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
04/01/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

04/01/24, 5:05 pm - +263 78 190 1631: I believe the first essay it’s an argumentative essay, so now I’ll answer: *Is it true that many Africans have poor diet because their farms are stagnant and inefficient *



Africans seems to be blessed with fertile farms.It is believed that they are the the most lucky people who possess rich soils.However, it differs from the climate which some Africans have but most Africans have favorable climate.Therefore, to a lesser extent that many Africans have poor diets .

Many Africans have rich diets because most of the farms found in Africa are very fertile. That is because agriculture is mainly practiced by many Africans so they make sure to improve the fertility of their soil each and every time. They even have their traditional ways of enriching the souls. Hence, many Africans produce rich diets from their crops.

On the other hand, many Africans have poor diets because of their stagnant and inefficient farms. They sometimes even lack the knowledge of improving their farms because they would be of the new generation, who does not have any idea on how to improve the fertility of the land traditionally. As a result, leading to the Africans having poor diets.

Many Africans also adopt various ways of farming from other continents which makes them greater farmers. By adopting the methods, they will have rich diets. One example of the methods is crop rotation. It improves the fertility of the soil and adds value to a crop. Consequently, they get rich diets from that method of farming.

However, Africans have less resources to enrich their diets through farming. They tend to be very responsible when it comes to farming but because of the shortage of farming resources, their farms remain stagnant and poor. They even face enormous problems. Therefore, the African farms will not transform to fertile from infertile.

Many Africans do some researcheson farming project. They even travel to other places trying to acquire knowledge how to improve their farming lands. Once they get to know all about this go and do what the got to know from others,be it new farming skills or something to improve their skills. Their crops are enriched along with the farming areas. So there’s no way Africans can have poor farms with them.

It can also be true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. Many Africans tend to do different traditional rituals. Some of the rituals may not be favored by the climate and it may change to a very hot one or to a cloudy one which will make it rain profusely, flooding the farming areas. Thus, the Africans will have poor diets.

Many Africans have rich diets. This is because they own large areas of farming which enables them to meet the needed space for a specific crop to grow well and rich. The crops will then provide them with rich diets. Thus, this means that many Africans have rich diets because of their good lands of farming.

So, according to my point of view many Africans have rich diets and few have poor diets because many Africans know about the traditional rituals while few know about it. The traditional rituals maybe rain making ceremony. Therefore, many Africans can have all what they need. For example, healthy food from their rich farms because they work for it.
