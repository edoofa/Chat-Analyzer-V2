06/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
06/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Moreblessing, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Vengere high school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?

06/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 71 338 5523: BEAM is an organization which pays school fees for children and  I'm being assisted by it because my parents can't afford the school fees for all of us
06/01/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Moreblessing!

So will the organisation be assisting you for your higher education as well?
06/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 71 338 5523: Noo it just assist until I finish my high school only
06/01/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, I do understand.
06/01/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Well Moreblessing now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
06/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 71 338 5523: Yes I believe it's a life changing decision because being given the chance to step into tertiary education is the first key of spinning life into success
06/01/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Moreblessing?
06/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 338 5523: Yes I'm ready  and I'm already preparing myself to produce better results
06/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Moreblessing, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
06/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 71 338 5523: They are aware of this program and they want me to study abroad as much as I do
06/01/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Are they willing to support you financially, Moreblessing?
06/01/24, 12:38 pm - +263 71 338 5523: Yes they are willing to do so but only if the amount is not much
06/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate, Moreblessing?
06/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 71 338 5523: If the amount of money required for this program is too much then I'm afraid my dreams will be shuttered because they can't afford
06/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand Moreblessing,

May I know what is your take on the expenses required?

You can share your knowledge of the cost of education abroad in USD!
06/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 71 338 5523: The amount of money needed to pay for a scholarship seat heard it's about $200USD
06/01/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: That's correct, however I shall guide you in detail later on.

What is your understanding of the other finances like Tuition fee, Accomodation?
06/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 71 338 5523: I also heard Edoofa assist with the tuition fees I don't know about accommodation
06/01/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: While the program provides 50-100% on the tuition fee itself!

You require financial support from your parents for other expenses around $1500-2000 a year, Moreblessing!
06/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 71 338 5523: Okay I understand
06/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
06/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Moreblessing, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
06/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 71 338 5523: Yes I do
06/01/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: So now may I know what is your take on the financial aspect Moreblessing?

Along with the same if your parents are willing to support you financially?
06/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 71 338 5523: I'm not yet sure about the financial aspect , I will have to discuss with my parents if they can afford
06/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
06/01/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
