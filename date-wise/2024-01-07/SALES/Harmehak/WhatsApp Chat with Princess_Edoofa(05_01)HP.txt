05/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 544 5199: Both please
05/01/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
05/01/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.
05/01/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you have an even better clarity that,

Actuarial Science is not a bachelor's or master's course, rather it is a certification that a student can pursue alongside pursuing their Degree, so what over here I was briefing you about is that the course of Bachelor in Commerce has several specializations Princess can specialize in Finance and Accounting starting from the second year of their course. 

Along with this degree she can pursue the certification of Actuarial Sciences itself. <This message was edited>

05/01/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well, thank you!
05/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 544 5199: Yes

05/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 77 544 5199: Ok understood
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Now that we have discussed about both her desired courses,

Kindly feel free to share any queries that you might have as of now regarding the course.
05/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 73 658 6720: No queries
05/01/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: Noted!
05/01/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: So which out of the two would you like to opt for, Princess?

*Meanwhile do go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians!*
05/01/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 6:31 pm - +263 73 658 6720: I will be able to study pharmacy  at an affordable price as compared to the universities here in Zimbabwe. 
After 4 years l will work in Hospitals but the main aim l want to achieve is the knowledge of the active ingredients of making the drugs .
My dream is to open a well established pharmacy and Edoofa can help me by enabling me to go for university abroad at a much affordable price and with the aid of their Counselors
05/01/24, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

Well answered, Princess.
05/01/24, 7:03 pm - +263 73 658 6720: Thank you
06/01/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
06/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 73 658 6720: Ok we can go on
06/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 77 544 5199: Ok
06/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: So now as we proceed ahead with the discussion, Princess and Mrs Leorcardia.

May I know what all do you recall regarding the costs and enrollment fee from our previous discussion please?
06/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 73 658 6720: It was $350 for the application fee
06/01/24, 11:15 am - Harmehak: Very correct,

What else do you recall regarding the tuition fee?
06/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 73 658 6720: I'm not sure but was it $1000 to $2000 per year
06/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 73 658 6720: Ok understood
06/01/24, 11:29 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
06/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 73 658 6720: It's good
06/01/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: I believe you must recall the Earn While You Learn Program too!

Can you please share a summary of your understanding of the Earn While You Learn Program and what all do you recall?
06/01/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: I await your response!
