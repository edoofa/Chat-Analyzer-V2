As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes
20/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the discussion so far, Tanatswa?
20/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 719 9961: not yet
20/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the delay please?
20/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 719 9961: it was just a small issue but now I have finished
20/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: I understand
20/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Tanatswa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Serima high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
20/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 719 9961: ok so I'm tanatswa chipare 
so as for what I have archived during my exams that is grade 7(with 8 units as for 5 written subjects)and my form form 4(with 8As 1B 2Cc as for 11 written subjects in science class) and still waiting for my a level results(maths physics and chemistry) I think I am an average student.
so I have done my studies at serima from form 1 up to form 6  and we paid 410USD every term. 
so I would like to study medicine because becoming a doctor was the only dream I wanted to live.
i have got my strength in sciences especially chemistry and haven't  discover my weakness yet  because with hardwork I still don't believe weakness exists.
so as for me I love playing chess and also love doing some gardening at home.
so my mother has got a degree in business management and IT still looking for a job and my father is an electrician and younger brothers who are still going on with their studies that is form 3 ,grade 3 and the youngest not yet going to school
20/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tanatswa, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

Are you the eldest sibling please?
20/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 719 9961: thank you .yes I am the eldest
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Well Tanatswa now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
20/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes I believe
20/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
20/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes I am prepared
20/12/23, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Tanatswa, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok
20/12/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
20/12/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 719 9961: Yes they are
21/12/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 719 9961: Morning yes we can start
21/12/23, 9:29 am - Harmehak: I await your response, Tanatswa
21/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 719 9961: Yes they are aware they are in this group
21/12/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: Duly noted!

So are they willing to support you financially and mentally as well, Tanatswa?
21/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 719 9961: Yes
21/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Duly noted, Tanatswa!
21/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
21/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 719 9961: Yes I am confident
21/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
21/12/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Please?
21/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 719 9961: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Received please
21/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: What motivates you to study Medicine, Tanatswa?
21/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 719 9961: The fact that I always wanted to be a doctor  and the feeling of wanting to help people with their lives motivates me
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

I can see you have a kind heart, Tanatswa. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 719 9961: thank you so much
21/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: So why didn't you pursue Biology, Tanatswa?

I believe it's an important science subject for medicine considering medicine is all about human body and living organisms!

Wouldn't you agree?
21/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 719 9961: I chose physics over biology because at serima biology teachers don't produce good biology results so I just decided physics would be the best
21/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please
21/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
21/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok does it mean there is no more room for medicine due to my subjects
21/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Unfortunately, no.

Biology is a strict requirement!
21/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics* <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok
21/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 719 9961: so what about if I want to do chemical engineering
21/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: You can pursue Engineering, Tanatswa.
21/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: These are options in Medical or health line.

Along with these you can pursue Engineering fields too.
21/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I would be scheduling your session for *Saturday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok
21/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Thanks for your time
23/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
23/12/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: Since we celebrate Christmas on Monday, *Hence, We will now connect on Tuesday at 9:30 AM CAT*. Please be online during your session time!

05/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 78 719 9961: Sorry I have been to a place where there was no network so I couldn't get in touch with you but now it's stable we can continue
05/01/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: You haven't been in stable network since 21st December, Tanatswa?
05/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 719 9961: yes  my  family and I had visited my grandparents so that place do not have a stable network
05/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: May I know why you didn't inform me the same earlier?
05/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 78 719 9961: I am sorry I didn't inform you earlier
05/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I understand
05/01/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the discussion so far?
05/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 719 9961: Yes I did so
05/01/24, 10:26 am - Harmehak: What is your take on the same?
05/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Chemical engineering
05/01/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: You can surely pursue the same!

What motivates you to opt for Chemical Engineering, Tanatswa?
05/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 78 719 9961: like I said before I'm very good  in chemistry so I just thought I might be good in chemical engineering
05/01/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand and appreciate the same,

Don't you believe Bachelors in Pharmacy would cater of these interests and well while still being in the medical field, Tanatswa?
05/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 78 719 9961: truly speaking medicine and chemical engineering were the 2 programs I wanted to do
05/01/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

Let me brief you about Chemical Engineering in that case.
05/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Technology (BTech) Chemical Engineering* is a four year undergraduate degree in engineering. Candidates that are A-level or equivalent are eligible to take admission in this BTech course. The BTech Chemical Engineering syllabus is based on the fundamentals of mathematics, physics and chemistry. Therefore, you must have an aptitude in these subjects in order to excel as a chemical engineer.

05/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok so you can take the master's using the same scholarship
05/01/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

You can surely pursue Masters as well under the scholarship.
05/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok
05/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 719 9961: I understand
05/01/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: As of now do you have any queries?
05/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 719 9961: I don't have any
05/01/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: So you would like to pursue the same itself?
05/01/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes
05/01/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: Alright Tanatswa, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
05/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 719 9961: In 5 years time I see myself as a great chemical engineer that any company will be willing to hire and that's my dream
05/01/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations, Tanatswa

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 719 9961: as for my country job opportunities for chemical engineering are less so I thought if I could study abroad I could get a get easily out there
05/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: Can you please recheck your last sentence, Tanatswa?

I believe you there was an error.
05/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Oh sorry I mean I could get a job easily out there
05/01/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing and I can see you are looking at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
05/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 78 719 9961: I just witnessed some people I know who studied in India and are now working being paid fairly well so from that time I wanted to study in India
05/01/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Well that's great

05/01/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Tanatswa!

Did you find the shared information helpful and interesting, Tanatswa?
05/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yaah it's interesting and it boosted my interest of studying in India
05/01/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 719 9961: No
05/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Tanatswa
05/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2700-$3700 per year as BTech Chemical Engineering is a niche course and not many universities offer scholarship for the same. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/01/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2700-3700 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
05/01/24, 2:41 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yaah I think it's good
05/01/24, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
05/01/24, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries for me, Tanatswa?
05/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 78 719 9961: I don't have any
05/01/24, 2:45 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted!

What is your thorough take on the costs along with the affordability, Tanatswa?
05/01/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 719 9961: It's fairly good
05/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yaah ok
05/01/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok I understood
05/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/01/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Are you thoroughly following the shared resources, Tanatswa?
05/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes I'm following
05/01/24, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 3:20 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yaah I can see
05/01/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: May I know what all did you learn so far regarding EWYL from the shared resources, Tanatswa?
05/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 719 9961: I just learned that you can pay your fees using this EWYL by just doing well during learning
05/01/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright, and did you go through Persistence's video as well?
05/01/24, 3:27 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes
05/01/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: That's great
05/01/24, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: So Tanatswa, now that we have discussed the finances along with the Earn While You Learn Program!

May I know if your parents are willing to support your higher education in India financially?
05/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes they are willing
05/01/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So Tanatswa, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes
05/01/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Tanatswa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/01/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ranging from $1500 to $2250
05/01/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/01/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/01/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 3:35 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok
05/01/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yaah I see
05/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
05/01/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/01/24, 3:39 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok
05/01/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/01/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/01/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Yes
05/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
05/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok
05/01/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/01/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/01/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents as well with Mrs Ruth, Tanatswa
05/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 719 9961: Ok
05/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Tanatswa, are you aware that there any many students from Serima High who are currently a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program?

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*Meanwhile kindly connect yourself and your parents with Mrs Ruth*
