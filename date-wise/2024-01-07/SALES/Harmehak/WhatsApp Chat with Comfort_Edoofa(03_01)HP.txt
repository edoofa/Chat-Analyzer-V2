Thats all l remember
04/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: I am glad you had a detailed discussion, Comfort!
04/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.

04/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 696 8034: Ok thanks noted
04/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
04/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 696 8034: Yeah true , l like this program a lot
04/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Comfort, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Nyashanu High charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
04/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 78 696 8034: My name is Comfort Misi. Um a guy aged 17. Now um doing my Form 6 at Nyashanu High.At Nyashanu we paying 400 USD every term and i wish to study engineering but not yet sure which type of engineering.Actually i am talented in many sporting activities like soccer,athletics,volleyball,handball and swimming. 


My background is not that perfect but my parents struggle to meet financial issues because they have got many responsibilities.We are six in our family two girls and four boys and i am the third born.My father is a Health Officer with a Masters in Public health and my mom is a teacher.All kids we are still going to school
04/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Comfort, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know more about your siblings please?
04/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 78 696 8034: The first one is studying nursing and the second one is studying environmental health n the forth one is a form 1 student and the fifth one is a grade 6 student lastly a little one not yet going to school
04/01/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Duly noted,

04/01/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Your mother is a teacher at which school please?
04/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 696 8034: A primary teacher at Raymondale primary
04/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
04/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Well Comfort, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
04/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 696 8034: I believe so if handled properly
04/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Would you add you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too? <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 696 8034: Yes um prepared
04/01/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Comfort, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
04/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 696 8034: Yes they are aware
04/01/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: I am glad,

Kindly address the other part of the question as well!
04/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 78 696 8034: Yes they are willing to support
04/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
04/01/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
04/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 78 696 8034: 100% confident
04/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: That's great
04/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Engineering ?
04/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 696 8034: A level subject combination Maths Physics Chemistry...
Because i feel like engineering is where i am called to and i am interested in it
04/01/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Well received please!

That's great,

So like you must understand there are various sub fields like Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, etc,

May I know what fields are you intrigued towards, Comfort?
04/01/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Ummm not yet mastered which field
04/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright, while I am here to assist,

Which field are you intrigued towards, Comfort?
04/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Nuclear one or automatic is fine
04/01/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
04/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand, Comfort.

Even if you proceed ahead now, you are given an opportunity to change your course by the time your results are out as well.

So having shared that, did you ever happen to research about Engineering?
04/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Yes i did
04/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: What all did you learn and research regarding various fields?
04/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have a fair knowledge, Comfort!

Were there any fields like Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer science engineering that you ever researched about?
04/01/24, 12:44 pm - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Duly received, Comfort.

So which field have you been most interested in from your research?
04/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Aerospace engineering was great in deed
04/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
04/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Now Confort, looking at your interests and passion for aero planes and aeronautics, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counselor I would like to highlight a few parameters

-This is a niche course that has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low

- If you opt for this branch, your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time, if you opt for a degree like *Mechanical Engineering*, it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical, Aerospace, Automotive, etc at the same time helps to fulfill your interests to solve challenges, to bring innovations, and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as the mother of Engineering!
04/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Ok i got it
04/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 696 8034: So whats really needed to do mechanical engineering
04/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: You can qualify on the basis of your subject combination please.

Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics is a mandatory requirement.
04/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 696 8034: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: I will discuss regarding the costs of the program in the later stage, Comfort.

Firstly, shall I brief you about Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering?
04/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 696 8034: Ok go on
04/01/24, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
