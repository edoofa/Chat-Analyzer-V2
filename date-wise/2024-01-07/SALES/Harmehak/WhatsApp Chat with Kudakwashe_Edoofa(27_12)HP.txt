*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development.

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

04/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok it's about economic crisis and  you know it is very interested to study abroad and the main issue is that 


You can not employed outside the country if you study in my country
04/01/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: You see, Kudakwashe, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
04/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yaaaah this is true
04/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Kudakwashe

04/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 688 0068: Ok ok thank you I'm better understanding now
04/01/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you did, Kudakwashe 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
04/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 688 0068: Yes
04/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: May I know your knowledge of the costs?
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
04/01/24, 7:02 pm - +263 78 547 4126: Ok ok thank you
04/01/24, 7:02 pm - +263 78 547 4126: Ok no problem
05/01/24, 9:01 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
05/01/24, 9:45 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok no problem
05/01/24, 9:46 am - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Kudakwashe?
05/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yes I do
05/01/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: In simple words Kudakwashe, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
05/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok great 
This is so good
05/01/24, 9:51 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the costs and affordability, Kudakwashe?
05/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 688 0068: This is much affordable
05/01/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
05/01/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Kudakwashe, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yaaaah this is true 
So in  india it cost $1200-1800
Is that you mean
05/01/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: If you perform well, you can surely score a 90-100% scholarship
05/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Kudakwashe?
05/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok ok thank you
05/01/24, 9:58 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yaaaah absolutely now I'm in a better position
05/01/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/01/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/01/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/01/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 78 688 0068: Well this is fantastic Ms Harmehak 
So the students must earn while learn
05/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: You get to be a part of the program from Zimbabwe itself and it's a choice for all the students.
05/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok this is great news Ms Harmehak
05/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yaaaah fantastic 
Now I see India the best
05/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yaaaah Edoofa is great Ms Harmehak
05/01/24, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the shared resources ( pictures and video), Kudakwashe?
05/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yes I do Ms Harmehak
05/01/24, 10:19 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yes I'm ready
05/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Kudakwashe, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 688 0068: How much
05/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok Ms Harmehak
05/01/24, 10:23 am - Harmehak: You have the address that, Kudakwashe
05/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok Ms Harmehak
05/01/24, 10:26 am - Harmehak: How much is $300x 5 and $450x5, Kudakwashe?
05/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 78 688 0068: I already understand Ms Harmehak
05/01/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: You have to answer that too, Kudakwashe.
05/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 78 688 0068: Is it me apply or Edoofa help the international students to get access to Indians Universities
05/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Kudakwashe, I will guide you please.

Firstly can you address the same?
05/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Edoofa helps.
05/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 78 688 0068: As for me  I just want to apply to one University
05/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok well
05/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: Kudakwashe, I believe you are confusing yourself.
05/01/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: I am only asking for you to calculate and share how much a student would spend without Edoofa.

Not how much you will spend.
05/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 688 0068: Oooh ok now I understand greater
05/01/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Good,

So how much is $300x5 and $450x5?
05/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yaaaah 
 $1500 and $2250
05/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok ok this is now affordable
05/01/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Kudakwashe!

You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yaaaaaah this is great
05/01/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/01/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 78 688 0068: Yaaaah this is great
05/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok ok I understand v
05/01/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/01/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/01/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

05/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 78 688 0068: Ok ok this is great
05/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 688 0068: May I apply
05/01/24, 11:29 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/01/24, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

05/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 688 0068: No reply yet
05/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

You can have a direct call later and encourage your parents for the same as well.
05/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

06/01/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Okay so Kudakwashe, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/01/24, 7:49 pm - +263 78 688 0068: Law is the program 

India is the country

The average cost without scholarship is $1200-$1800 per year

annual feee is $1200-$1800 per year

300 and 400 is the enrollment fee

Never discussed about it
06/01/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Kindly correct answer 3, and you haven't addressed answer 6
06/01/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Don't you recall discussing about registration fee, Kudakwashe?

Thank you for reminding me
