06/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
06/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 405 2720: I am confident enough as an Edoofian student.

06/01/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate,

Did you find the shared information interesting and thoroughly helpful, Lydia?
06/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 405 2720: This message was deleted
06/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 77 405 2720: Yes
06/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
06/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 405 2720: Nop we don't
06/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
06/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 405 2720: But I only discovered India as the best country which offers quality education and that's why I chose it
06/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: That's appreciative.
06/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 405 2720: Very appreciative because I can see that India is very affordable.
06/01/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
06/01/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Lydia, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
06/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 405 2720: I am very pleased and very appreciative as an Edoofian student I will work hard to have exclusive results for me to have a higher quantum of Scholarship by this it has really motivated me more to be progressive
06/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate the same, Lydia!
06/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Lydia, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
06/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 405 2720: I agree which states that Zimbabwe is very expensive.
06/01/24, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Lydia?
06/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 405 2720: Yes I do agree with you
06/01/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
06/01/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 405 2720: Its indeed very cheap, I really appreciate.
06/01/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/01/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

06/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 77 405 2720: I love this program it teaches as well tactics and job skills and how to make money ourselves in order to help also our parents in financial stability.It also opens the mind of students and promote critical thinking.
06/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Lydia
06/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 77 405 2720: And also helps us to pay off the credits.
06/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Indeed
06/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 405 2720: I do appreciate
06/01/24, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
06/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 405 2720: Its indeed very cheap and affordable

06/01/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
06/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 405 2720: Okay
06/01/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Lydia, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
06/01/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

06/01/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: I have been expecting your response, Lydia.
