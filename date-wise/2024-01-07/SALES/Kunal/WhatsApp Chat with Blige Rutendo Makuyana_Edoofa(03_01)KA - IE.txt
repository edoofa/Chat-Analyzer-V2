04/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
04/01/24, 5:20 pm - +263 71 753 0530: Okay thank you
04/01/24, 5:21 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>

05/01/24, 9:51 am - Kunal: May I know with your interests in Minning Engineering, why didn't you opt for Chemistry at A level?
05/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 71 753 0530: Because it was quite a difficult subject for me
05/01/24, 10:04 am - Kunal: I understand, since you are not having Chemistry, you are not eligible for Minning Engineering

*Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering*

*Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering*

Do you want me to explain these courses in depth for you?
05/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 71 753 0530: Yes please
05/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 431 8057: What are the chances of getting a job after those programs coz in Zimbabwe it's a nightmare
05/01/24, 10:31 am - Kunal: Both Bachelor of *Technology in Computer Science Engineering and Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* are reputable and sought-after programs in the field of engineering. Completing these degrees in India can provide strong foundations in theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The job prospects in these fields are generally promising, considering the growing demand for skilled professionals in the technology and engineering sectors.
05/01/24, 10:31 am - Kunal: In the realm of *Computer Science Engineering*, graduates often find opportunities in software development, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and various IT-related roles. India, being a global IT hub, offers a plethora of job opportunities in renowned tech companies.

On the other hand, graduates in *Electrical Engineering* can explore roles in power generation, electronics, telecommunications, and automation. With the expanding infrastructure projects and technological advancements, there is a continuous demand for electrical engineers in the world
05/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 753 0530: Besides venturing into engineering what other options do i have
05/01/24, 10:42 am - Kunal: Rutendo, I'm curious to learn if you've thoroughly researched and considered potential career paths beyond the field of engineering. Have you explored various options to better understand your career aspirations?
05/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 71 753 0530: No i only had researched in mining engineering and here in Zimbabwe i was eligible to do the program
05/01/24, 12:08 pm - Kunal: Mining is a field of engineering that is concerned with the extraction and processing of minerals from the earth. It is a field that has been around for centuries and is currently experiencing a resurgence due to the increased demand for materials such as metals, minerals, and oil. However, due to the changing nature of the world’s economy, it is unclear whether mining will remain a viable field of study and profession 10 years down the line. 

One of the primary reasons why mining may not be successful 10 years down the line is the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. With the world’s reliance on fossil fuels decreasing, there is less need for the materials that mining engineers specialize in extracting and processing. Furthermore, the increasing focus on environmental conservation has also contributed to this shift, as the extraction of minerals and materials can often have a negative impact on the environment. 

Finally, the increasing cost of labor may also be a factor in the decreased relevance of mining engineering 10 years down the line. As the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for mining companies to remain profitable. This can lead to mining companies cutting back on labor costs, which can reduce the demand for mining and other professionals in the field. 

In conclusion, mining may not be successful 10 years down the line due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields, and the increasing cost of labor. As a result, mining may need to look for other opportunities in order to remain relevant and successful in the future.

Since you are not having Chemistry, you are not eligible for civil engineering, Rutendo
06/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 71 753 0530: Then can i have  a little bit of time to find another program
06/01/24, 11:28 am - Kunal: That would be fine

06/01/24, 12:26 pm - Kunal: Greetings Mr Makuyana
 Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.

06/01/24, 12:37 pm - Kunal: Alright Mr Makuyana
