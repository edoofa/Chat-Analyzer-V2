03/01/24, 10:23 am - Kunal: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

04/01/24, 11:57 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
04/01/24, 12:00 pm - +27 84 605 0123: Yes
04/01/24, 12:27 pm - Kunal: Good to know that
May I know with your interest towards Biomedical engineering, why didn't you opt for Physics at A level?
04/01/24, 1:05 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
