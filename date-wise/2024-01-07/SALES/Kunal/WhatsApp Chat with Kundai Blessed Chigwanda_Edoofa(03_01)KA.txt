This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

We have received the application of Kundai for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
03/01/24, 2:18 pm - Kunal: Kundai, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me:
1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2) What are your understandings of the program as discussed with Leonor?
03/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay let me answer <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 047 7770: It is my pleasure that you gave me the opportunity to say it out the motivation on why l applies for the Edoofa scholarship program 

1)

So since as a child it has been my passion and dreams to study abroad whilst in the medical field. I have always been wanting to be a doctor but somehow due to career guidance that l managed to be involved in l realised that in the  medical field  there is no a doctor only,  rather there are many programs and jobs in  there , l appreciate my Uncle as one of my mentors who managed to encourage me and motivating me upto this level. The very moment my friend told me about your program l was happy amd by that time l told myself that finally my dream has come true and l believed in myself that l will secure a place there and she also told me on how you can assist one another with your organization 

From what l read in the document your sent me l felt like l really suit in with the qualifications you managed to list .l have heard about your access to quality education , the need for employability in higher education and your ability to provide educational opportunities to underprivileged and deserving students across the whole world. 

It was my pleasure when l heard that you offer these scholarships with the leading universities,  l really want to be studying in India as l heard of its quality education as well .

It is with my great honour to be part of the Edoofa scholarship program  together with the benefits your offer .I believe that working with you would help me in achieving my goals and passion with your organization.  As a child who have dreams to achieve more and being recognized as one of the top students  but without funds to make me that great somebody in the world is the main reason that motivated me to apply for the Edoofa Scholarships fund . 


I believe these are some of the motivations behind my application for the Edoofa scholarship program. <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 78 047 7770: My understanding are as follows;

When l discussed with Leonora she highlighted to me that you offer a variety of programs at your program to both the under privileged and the deserving students across the whole globe. She also told me that you get the opportunity to the career guidance on what you want to do which is one of the best thing l admire. And supporting together other extracurricular programs together with mentorship .Leonora also told me that you offer opportunities to various branches and your students resulting in greater marketing access . She highlighted your assistance on how you apply for the scholarships process until you land in India
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - Kunal: Your heartfelt expression of your dreams and aspirations is truly inspiring. It's evident that your passion for the medical field has been a driving force, and your journey reflects the valuable impact of mentorship from your uncle. The realization that the medical field offers a myriad of programs and career paths is a crucial insight gained through career guidance.

Your enthusiasm upon discovering the Edoofa scholarship program and its potential to make your dream of studying abroad a reality is genuinely uplifting. Your eagerness to secure a place and your belief in the alignment of your qualifications with the program's criteria are noteworthy.

Please discuss the same with your family and let me know once you are done
04/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay for sure 😊
05/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Good morning

05/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 047 7770: That is great

And as well the do agree on the scholarship rules 

But they also asked that after the graduation of the end of your program are you guaranteed to get a job , if so will l get the job in India , back in Zimbabwe or somewhere else ?

And on the Visa issue , if results come favourable we have to go to the Indian Embassy in Zimbabwe? 

What if the results come late,  so what is mainly your due dates ? So thay we know 

And then what if results come otherwise whilst you would have already offered my a place at the Edoofa scholarship program 

That's some of the questions l still recall
05/01/24, 4:13 pm - Kunal: Alright Kundai
Let me help you understand
05/01/24, 4:14 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that Edoofa doesn’t offer jobs directly to students as of now. We are preparing students throughout the course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and get transformed into employable and professional citizens of the era!
They will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills. 

 Once they complete they are already having hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally
05/01/24, 4:15 pm - Kunal: Yes, , if results come favourable you will have to go to the Indian Embassy in Zimbabwe and our Visa team will be guiding you in the hope process
05/01/24, 4:27 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Please bear with me on the network issues 🙏🏻
05/01/24, 4:49 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>

05/01/24, 5:48 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay okay l get it 

Thank you so much 🙏🏻
05/01/24, 5:51 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Wow 
 thank you so much for the highlights
05/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay will be here at 10:00am

06/01/24, 10:54 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you

As per your understanding from the document, may I know what is the cost of education for an international student offered by Edoofa? <This message was edited>
06/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 047 7770: From my understanding 
The cost of education for an international student offered by Edoofa is 4000-5000 


Cost of education without Edoofa ($6000-$8000) subtracting cost reduced l pay  ($2000-$3000) =cost offered by Edoofa($4000-$5000)

Therefore the cost you pay as Edoofa program is $4000-$5000
And the cost that l pay is $2000-$3000 <This message was edited>
06/01/24, 11:27 am - Kunal: That is correct
So, have you discussed about the same with your family?
06/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 047 7770: Thank you 

Yes we discussed about it
06/01/24, 11:48 am - Kunal: May I know what their feedback was?
06/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 047 7770: They considered the program reasonable and very helpful since it helps in covering fees making it easy and very preferable to consider the program 

They really appreciated the affordability of the costs
06/01/24, 12:13 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
May I know if your uncle is part of this group?

06/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 047 7770: My main reason is an ambition to help people. A genuine sincerity to help others had been my main motivation in medical career. My dreams and passion for science had been a primary motivator in my career choice. Through visiting different hospitals and clinics had enhanced my interest in the medical fields together with the motivation from my family members .Admiring the way those doctors in laboratories work. My biggest dream is to treat a person whom many doctors would have given up on that person and to be recognized as one of them .

What inspired me to pursue a career in medical field is with the desire to help Others,th desire to serve others . As a medical scientist, you hold the power to make a profound impact on people's lives by easing pain and suffering, curing diseases, and improving their health and well-being therefore am ready to do that . There are some doctors that l admire the most despite that l have not yet seen them but l believe one day l will . The use of career guidance had given me enough motivation in what l want to be .One of the main reasons that enhanced me in pursuing in my career is the career guidance l receives from this girl by the name Charmaine Kahiya who is doing the Computational Pharmaceuticals under  Drug discovery .

I believe that the healthcare field is fast-paced and exciting.The medical field is exciting and ever-changing. Each day will present new information and challenges, keeping things interesting. New patients will require your expertise every day to day.
