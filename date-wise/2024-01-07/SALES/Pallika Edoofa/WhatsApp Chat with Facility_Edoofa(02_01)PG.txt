I learnt that Edoofa is a scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt ltd,, India. It believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of the elite. It solves both problems of lack of affordability and employability in higher education. It also aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities to mention a few.

I have a dream to further my education studies but I have a financial hump ahead. I believe if I am accepted into the Edoofa Program I will be able to fulfill my dreams and cross River Rubicon

03/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 385 3785: It's definitely not a worth thing to invest in
03/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 385 3785: Ok ok
03/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 71 385 3785: So the friend of mine was misinformed
03/01/24, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!

*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

03/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 385 3785: There's really a big difference indeed
03/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 385 3785: Through God's Grace we can push to make it a dream come true
03/01/24, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
03/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 385 3785: Through discussions with Pauline she told me about the earn as you learn program which will further reduce educational expense
03/01/24, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable through the *Earn While You Learn Program*
03/01/24, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
03/01/24, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
03/01/24, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
03/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 385 3785: I will definitely benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program
03/01/24, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
03/01/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 385 3785: EWYL encourages hardworking and definitely helps to reduce financial pressure on families
03/01/24, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
03/01/24, 4:04 pm - +263 71 385 3785: It's difficult to choose the most significant I feel that these four facts complement each other. You first get expert career Counseling after that you still needs affordable education through guaranteed scholarship, these scholarship will be backed by Earn While You Learn and during learning you still need Higher education Concierge gaining guidance on Visas, fee assistance to mention. However although they complement each other I think the number 2 of Affordability through guaranteed scholarships is borne and others will come as flesh
03/01/24, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

03/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 71 385 3785: Mommy and Uncle Zhou
03/01/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!

 I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
03/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 71 385 3785: I will definitely discuss with them, they are really optimistic and supportive
03/01/24, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
03/01/24, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
03/01/24, 4:31 pm - +263 71 385 3785: Ok ok that's great,, I may not have a detailed information on other recommendations your help on knowing is warmly welcome
03/01/24, 7:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
03/01/24, 7:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 8:02 pm - +263 71 385 3785: It's okay Madam🙏🙏🙏
04/01/24, 6:03 am - +263 71 385 3785: Morning Ma'am I beg you to politely reschedule the session for tomorrow I have complications here my battery is about to shutdown no electricity I was hoping that it may come overnight but it's yet to come
04/01/24, 9:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*“The only way to have a life is to commit to it like crazy.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
04/01/24, 9:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please let me know once available.
04/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 8:48 am - +263 71 385 3785: Morning Ma'am I am available today
05/01/24, 8:55 am - +263 71 385 3785: Very sorry my phone was off
05/01/24, 9:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
05/01/24, 9:16 am - +263 71 385 3785: Greetings Ma'am we may begin with the session
05/01/24, 9:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
05/01/24, 9:18 am - +263 71 385 3785: Am good Ma'am and hw are you
05/01/24, 9:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are clear upto this, So, let me tell you that When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/01/24, 9:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 71 385 3785: Yeah you may inform me Ma'am
05/01/24, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
05/01/24, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
05/01/24, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
05/01/24, 9:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
05/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 71 385 3785: Okay well that's great
05/01/24, 9:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 71 385 3785: We have discussed stage 1
05/01/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!
05/01/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Facility,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
05/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 71 385 3785: Yes
05/01/24, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
05/01/24, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
05/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 71 385 3785: Yeah am clear
05/01/24, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
05/01/24, 9:58 am - +263 71 385 3785: Not yet maybe along the way but so far no question
05/01/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Facility, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
05/01/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com*

06/01/24, 10:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is fine,

7.
