I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer* 


We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Kooji*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the application form which you submitted and what I was able to understand from the same!
03/01/24, 10:58 am - +260 97 5610521: Good Day Sir, Yes you have contacted the right person.

I'm online we can discuss.
03/01/24, 11:30 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Waabei, How are you?
03/01/24, 11:35 am - +260 97 5610521: Am fine thank you and you sir
03/01/24, 11:58 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great pelase
03/01/24, 11:58 am - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Kooji?*
03/01/24, 12:15 pm - +260 97 5610521: *What motivated me to apply for Edoofa.* 
I've always had the interest to study abroad because I believe it would grant me the opportunity to access better academic opportunities that might not be available in my own country. It also grants me the opportunity to learn about different cultures as I'll be exposed to different people during my study .

 *What I understand about the program.* 
He told me, he knew about the program here in Zambia during one of the visits of the people from the University. Which is for June/July intake. He said he had been tasked to recommend more people to apply for the schoolarship which would increase his schoolarship points. He also mentioned that the schoolarship would be given to an individual based on ones patents financial state.  But I'd love to learn more about it from you.

Thank You.
03/01/24, 12:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that, I Can see that you go through the same school as Kooji, So are friends with Kooji Malichi?
03/01/24, 12:58 pm - +260 97 5610521: Yes we are friends
03/01/24, 1:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that, So I would like to update you that, Kooji was my student, And I helped him clear the scholarship program in the month of August last year!
03/01/24, 1:09 pm - +260 97 5610521: That's great, Can I please get more information on the schoolarship? The percentage, are there any people who're recipients of the schoolarship that are currently in India especially if there are any from Zambia apart from Kooji. And how does the clearing of the schoolarship work? And is the schoolarship applicable to any course one wants to study or it's for specific one? And any other information.
03/01/24, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes Please, I will be covering all the things in detail ahead!

03/01/24, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
03/01/24, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.
03/01/24, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Eoodfa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..
03/01/24, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia

03/01/24, 5:29 pm - +260 97 5610521: My name is Wabei Mununga from Zambia. I am 18 years old born on 5th March 2005. I am from Solwezi in the North Western Part of Zambia. I completed my high school (grade 12) last year so I am currently waiting for my results which are scheduled to come out this Month.

I’m interested in engineering and would therefore love to study Civil Engineering to be specific .  My moms highest level of education is high school, she is currently a business lady while my dad works under Zambia Army as a Soldier. 
Both my parents have been supporting my education so far and am sure they will do the same for my higher education.

I am the last born in a family of four. I have one sister who is the eldest and two brothers. My sister works as a nurse, the second born is still In school and my immediate elder brother also joined the army right after high school which is  where he’s currently working.

I completed my high school education at Legacy School based here in North Western. Once my results are out, I am looking forward to being accepted at one of the Universities under the Edoofa Scholarship which will be a great opportunity to further my education.

Thank you so much.
03/01/24, 5:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth?

04/01/24, 9:07 am - +260 97 5610521: I was previously at Legacy School based in Solwezi,North Western.Legacy School accommodates learners from pre class to grade 12. It offers both day school and boarding school .It strives for the pupils moral and academic excellence. Which is instilled in pupils from the time they join the Sch. I have been a Pupil there since grade 8 as a day schooler till I completed my grade 12. 

Legacy School is known for producing excellent students in solwezi both in academics and moral wise. The school helped me learn social skills and the basics of life. It also lays emphasis of extracurricular activities which every student is mandated to participate in for their own personal development. As a student there, I was helped to identify my interests outside academics. I actively participated in sports mostly the 100 meter race and was involved in poetry.

Thank you so much

04/01/24, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to Civil Engineering, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
04/01/24, 4:24 pm - +260 97 5610521: I have always been interested in design and construction. Since entering High School, my interest shifted more to infrastructural designs. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the opportunity to take subjects related to that because my school didn’t offer them but every time I see a good constructed building, I’m intrigued and curious on how  it came about and the whole process seems interesting which I’d love to be a part of.

Also, being Zambian, which is a developing nation, I’d love to be a part of the people that will develop the country by coming up with modern infrastructure in our country. And if given the opportunity to study outside Zambia, I believe it’ll even broaden my view of what beautifully constructed infrastructure looks like. 

Thank you
04/01/24, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so Wabei, After understanding your interests and motivation
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering*
04/01/24, 4:48 pm - +260 97 5610521: Alright, thank you so much.
04/01/24, 4:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.

Have a good night.
05/01/24, 8:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Wabei, Mr and Mrs Mununga @260975610521 @260975610504 @260972588604 @260975578615, How are you?

05/01/24, 8:38 am - +260 97 5610521: Yes
05/01/24, 8:41 am - Shubham Madhwal: That's amazing, can you tell me If you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams? *Answer in Detail*
05/01/24, 9:28 am - +260 97 5610521: I see myself working and applying the knowledge that I will learn through the course to develop my country and the world at large in one way or the other.
I also see myself encouraging young people to persue Civil Engineering or any other course of their dreams, encouraging them that it's possible to achieve any of their dreams if they put their minds to it and that together we can help society with the knowledge we obtain from our studies.

I also see myself encouraging other people to apply for their studies through the Edoofa program if it'll still be available at that time. Giving them myself as an example of how the program helped me convert my dreams into reality.

From what I have read about the program, I understand it supports with internship or student related jobs so this will help me get a practical experience of engineering and hence help me become one of the future leaders of my country.
05/01/24, 9:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
05/01/24, 9:34 am - +260 97 5610521: Thank you sir and yes am willing to do so
05/01/24, 9:35 am - Shubham Madhwal: As per the eligibility criteria,  In order to help the students get a quality education and a good quantum of  scholarship, Students should clear the following aspects:

1. I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria, in order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 4 Grade 12 passes.

2. Students should manage to clear our in-house scholarship test and interview process with an overall aggregate of 80% and above.

In case a student has a grade greater than or equal to 6 Grade Description: Satisfactory, then we do consider special recommendations by the School Heads taking into consideration other Extra-Curricular or Sports activities.

05/01/24, 10:30 am - Shubham Madhwal: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
05/01/24, 10:33 am - +260 97 5610521: Yes please, why India and not other countries?
05/01/24, 11:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

1. *Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education. Students can choose from a wide range of disciplines, including politics, philosophy, engineering, medical sciences, biology, business, and media/journalism.

05/01/24, 1:15 pm - +260 97 5610521: Alright thank you, it's well understood.
05/01/24, 1:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please are you occupied elsewhere?
05/01/24, 1:23 pm - +260 97 5610521: No am not
05/01/24, 1:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So please be prompt with your replies Wabei!
05/01/24, 1:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future.
05/01/24, 1:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
05/01/24, 1:30 pm - +260 97 5610521: Just like I said before studying abroad would grant me the opportunity to access better academic opportunities that might not be available in my native country it also grants me the opportunity to learn about different culture as I will be exposed to different people during my study
05/01/24, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
05/01/24, 1:39 pm - +260 97 5610521: No, not yet
05/01/24, 1:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
05/01/24, 1:43 pm - +260 97 5610521: I have an idea but can you please enlighten me more on that <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
05/01/24, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
05/01/24, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
05/01/24, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:25 pm - +260 97 5610521: Thank you
05/01/24, 2:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
05/01/24, 2:48 pm - +260 97 5610521: Kindly elloborat more on the Earn while you learn program
05/01/24, 2:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Surely pelase!
05/01/24, 2:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
05/01/24, 2:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/01/24, 2:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
05/01/24, 2:51 pm - +260 97 5610521: Thank you for that information
05/01/24, 3:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/01/24, 3:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/01/24, 3:20 pm - +260 97 5610521: The earn as you learn program will help me  gain excellent work experience and learn new job skills while giving me an ideal of how my employment life will turn out.
And yes I think it will be quite beneficial for me

05/01/24, 3:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
05/01/24, 3:31 pm - +260 97 5610521: Yes it is
05/01/24, 3:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 3:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
05/01/24, 3:41 pm - +260 97 5610521: Those are stages that one has to go through for someone to be finally admitted under the Edoofa program
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
05/01/24, 3:47 pm - +260 97 5610521: No,so far I don't
05/01/24, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
05/01/24, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
05/01/24, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
05/01/24, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
05/01/24, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
05/01/24, 3:57 pm - +260 97 5610521: 1.Expert Career Counseling sounds interesting as it is I never got a chance to learn the subjects involved in my career so with the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselor i can develop career wise
05/01/24, 4:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
05/01/24, 4:07 pm - +260 97 5610521: Yes you did
05/01/24, 4:24 pm - +260 97 5610521: How do I save that money
05/01/24, 4:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
05/01/24, 4:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
05/01/24, 4:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 4:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
05/01/24, 4:45 pm - +260 97 5610521: Okay I understand
05/01/24, 4:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
05/01/24, 4:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).
05/01/24, 4:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
05/01/24, 4:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
