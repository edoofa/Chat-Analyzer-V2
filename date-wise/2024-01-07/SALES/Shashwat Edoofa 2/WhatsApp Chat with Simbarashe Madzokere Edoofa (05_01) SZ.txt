05/01/24, 7:01 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Thank you for the information and thank you for shortlisting Simbarashe. We are willing to work with you through all the steps to make sure he is successful in this application
05/01/24, 7:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your son ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
05/01/24, 7:17 pm - +27 78 003 4261: I am 45 and my wife is 43. Simba is the eldest of our 3 children. 
Our highest level of Education is national Diploma for both me and my wife. I have a Diploma in  Instrumentation and Control while Patience has a Diploma in Forestry. 
I am currently working in South Africa as a Technician on a contract basis. 
We always want to equip our children with the best education hence in 2023 we decided to move our children back to Zimbabwe where we believed they will get better education and also scholarships opportunities if they studied Cambridge examinations.  University education is very expensive in Zimbabwe and South Africa hence we support our children to excel in school so that they can qualify for bursaries and scholarships. 
Simba has always been a keen and responsible student throughout his primary and secondary education and now in advanced level he has improved immensely. 
Through his achievements academically and also his conduct, he has been appointed to be a prefect at his current school.  
So besides being an excellent student he is also a natural leader. He is currently studying Business and Economics subjects at A level.

Your national diplomas in Instrumentation and Control, and Forestry demonstrate a solid educational background. It's commendable that, despite working on a contract basis in South Africa, you prioritize your children's education and believe in the quality of education they can receive in Zimbabwe, including the opportunities for scholarships through Cambridge examinations.

She puts in a lot of extra work in order to pass the Grade. I must admit that unlike Simbarashe,the move to Zimbabwe did affect her negatively at first but she has currently improved in the last part of the year.
06/01/24, 11:00 am - +27 78 003 4261: Then there is Tawana, the last born. He is now in Form 1 and doing very well.  He is a naturally gifted who doesn't require a lot of effort to make the grade. He is a very keen and talented sportsman also.

06/01/24, 12:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Simbarashe's education abroad?
06/01/24, 12:19 pm - +27 78 003 4261: At the moment,  I will be the one
06/01/24, 12:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Fortune and Mrs. Tariro. You are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to your children's well-being is truly admirable!
