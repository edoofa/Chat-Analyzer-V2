20/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 977 5216: My Ordinary level standing is
2A’s 5B’s 3C’s
I could send the certificate if you like..
20/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I wrote my Advanced level this year and my results come out on the 10th of January..
I was doing *Mathematics Chemistry & Biology*
And had hopes of starting *Physics* this year and writing it in June..

But due to financially crippling situation I was only able to write *2 subjects, Math & Chem*
That it to say, I am awaiting results for those those 2 subjects
20/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I completed my Alevels at Smit Academy..
I want help people on the largest scale possible..
I’m interested in learning about other religions & reading books
My mothers highest qualification is Ordinary level.. she had a very successful business but went bankrupt more than half a decade ago.. now she lives and works odd-jobs in South Africa..
I’m the youngest of 3, and the only one inmy family to Advance to A level..
20/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 977 5216: That should be all..
20/12/23, 1:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Tatenda. Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable. Your aspirations to help people on a large scale and your genuine interest in learning about other religions and reading books are truly commendable.

The curiosity and openness you demonstrate in exploring diverse religious perspectives through reading underscore your intellectual curiosity and respect for different belief systems! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed illumination on "Financially Crippling Situation", please?
20/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Thank you very much..
20/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Currently, I mostly live with relatives but my mother has a house in Harare. Just before the time the exam fee was announced my mother didn’t have the money and she made a decision that wasn’t easy to sell the house, she figured the money would go a long way besides my exam fee. She received the downpayment for the house and within the same week, as if fate were against it, she got robbed of all the money and injured to a very saddening state..

A few weeks later the exam fee was announced, we couldn make the due date. The people who had bought the house started giving excuses and we eventually lost hope in them. The only reason i was able to register was because of the late registration extension and we were barely able to afford to register those 2 subjects..
20/12/23, 2:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am truly sorry to hear about the challenging circumstances you and your family are facing, Tatenda. Facing such adversities requires great strength, and I commend you and your family for navigating through these challenges. I sincerely hope that despite the setbacks, you find the resilience to overcome these difficulties.

20/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?
20/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 977 5216: My mother will, the situation is more or less stabled..
And from what I understand, the Edoofa programs assists candidates with finding part time jobs to pay off the rest of their financial needs.. or is that no longer the case?..
20/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that we offer a distinctive program that allows students to engage in internships and self-finance a significant part of their fees while completing their coursework. I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
20/12/23, 4:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, could you kindly tell me how much *Smit Academy* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education? <This message was edited>

27/12/23, 9:46 am - +27 84 881 9934: Tatenda is offline I think there's a problem of network that side. I hope he will be come as soon as possible
27/12/23, 10:14 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Rosemary! May I know whether you are available for the session right now, please?
27/12/23, 10:19 am - +27 84 881 9934: I am
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly brief me regarding Tatenda's career aspirations more vividly, please?
27/12/23, 10:23 am - +27 84 881 9934: Tatenda told me that he want to study medicine
27/12/23, 10:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mrs. Rosemary, could you please share why Tatenda didn't pursue Physics in his A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
27/12/23, 10:35 am - +27 84 881 9934: I think it's because it's a science subject since he want to become a medical doctor in future
27/12/23, 10:37 am - +27 84 881 9934: It's a critical subject but Tatenda is a hard worker according to study
27/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
27/12/23, 11:29 am - +27 84 881 9934: He was studying physics, chemistry, biology and maths. But due to financial problems he wrote only 2 subjects
27/12/23, 11:29 am - +27 84 881 9934: And I hope he will write on June
27/12/23, 12:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mrs. Rosemary. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with Tatenda's A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
27/12/23, 12:27 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Go ahead please
27/12/23, 12:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that he could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Number 7
27/12/23, 12:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have some prior knowledge regarding the program, please?
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - +27 84 881 9934: I don't have any knowledge I think I just like it
27/12/23, 12:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Physiotherapy
*Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

27/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Barchelor of science in
Chemistry, medical laboratory technology and cardiovascular technology
27/12/23, 1:40 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Hopefully but he really wants medicine
27/12/23, 1:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am doing fine as well, Tatenda. Thank you for asking!
27/12/23, 1:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have done some prior research regarding the courses, please?
27/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 977 5216: No.. not quite..
27/12/23, 2:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would sincerely appreciate it if you could take a moment to conduct some research regarding the available courses. This would greatly assist me in providing you with more accurate and personalized guidance in alignment with your career inclinations, Tatenda.
27/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I don’t have access to the internet right now, but i will as doon as i can..
27/12/23, 2:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Tatenda. I will be waiting for your response, please.
27/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I do however have a question..

I previously heard that 8pts would be the minimum for a 50% scholarship for someone who wrote 3 subjects..
Given my situation having written only 2 subjects.. isit allthe same or does it work logically as half of fifteen is 8 and half of 10 is 5..
So 5pts is a 50% scholarship ooor???..
27/12/23, 2:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
27/12/23, 4:45 pm - +27 84 881 9934: I hope so
27/12/23, 5:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 5:30 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Thank you so much good evening
27/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Thank you, goodnight..

29/12/23, 9:03 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"In the symphony of life, education is the melody that resonates across generations, shaping the harmony of a brighter future." - Unknown*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
29/12/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 977 5216: Sure..
Good morning..
29/12/23, 9:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tatenda!
29/12/23, 9:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
29/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 977 5216: I assume it’s very high..
29/12/23, 12:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tatenda! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
29/12/23, 12:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 12:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
29/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Well it is the equivalent of buying and shipping a small car each year so it’s not too affordable..
But it does trump other options by a lot so i guess..
29/12/23, 12:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
29/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I’ve never been to university, so I don’t know the normal tuition construct..
Of course it’s been cut down by almost half..
But 1500$ per semester might stillbe a but challenging..
But i can only hope that more of the tuition will be reduced, i.e i get a higher scholarship percentage..
And that the larrn while you work program is really that effective..
In any case I’d probably have to make due without stufflike gym expenses..
29/12/23, 1:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tatenda. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
29/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 977 5216: No.. explain further please
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tatenda. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/12/23, 1:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
29/12/23, 1:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
29/12/23, 1:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
29/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 977 5216: This all sounds very great..
Yes, yes I believe it will be..
29/12/23, 1:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
29/12/23, 1:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
29/12/23, 1:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
29/12/23, 1:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

*"Education is the bridge between dreams and reality; the more sturdy its pillars, the farther one can travel." - Anonymous*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
02/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 977 5216: Good Morning Mr Shashwat..
Happy New Years..
Yes, we may begin..
02/01/24, 10:44 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tatenda!
02/01/24, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
02/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 71 977 5216: Yes.. yess i have..
02/01/24, 10:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the question, please?
02/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 71 977 5216: This was my initial reply to the question..
02/01/24, 11:08 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is good to know, Tatenda. May I know whether you think it is affordable now, please?
02/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 71 977 5216: Yes.. yes I believe it is..
02/01/24, 11:22 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
02/01/24, 11:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
02/01/24, 11:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
02/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Number 4
02/01/24, 1:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Tatenda! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
02/01/24, 1:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
02/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 977 5216: They are all very enthusiastic..
02/01/24, 2:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
02/01/24, 2:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
02/01/24, 2:46 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Well it all depends, if the statement isfor my concierge(you) then i would assume it unnecessary because i would peg thatby now you know me..

And the letter of recommendation is practical I suppose..
02/01/24, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
02/01/24, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/01/24, 3:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 3:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 71 977 5216: This is all great..
And I understand the fact that the ‘enrollment’ fee hasbeen decreased enormously..

My question is, I can only receive an acceptance letterfrom the academic board when our counseling session is completed, correct?
02/01/24, 3:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
02/01/24, 3:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
02/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Okay, wonderful..
My next question wouldbe, is it possible to somehow delay or rather pause phase one for a while..

If the counseling session completion is delayed, then the acceptance letter arrivesa little later and the 7 day period will it turn end a little later from that as well..

Don’t get me wrong, 200$ isn’t that much of course.. but 7 days might be a bit of an issue, mainly because my mom was inthe middle of renewing my passport .. and as things are going, I sense that this counseling session is almost at it’s conclusion..
02/01/24, 3:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what challenges are you facing, please?
02/01/24, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 10:30 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Forgive me, I needed to get a gold of my mother first before I could reply..
We shall proceed tomorrow then.. goodnight..
03/01/24, 8:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Knowledge is the lantern that illuminates the darkest corners of ignorance, paving the way for progress and enlightenment." - Unknown*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
03/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 71 977 5216: Good morning @918350976168, yess we may begin..
03/01/24, 9:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tatenda!
03/01/24, 9:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the question, please?
03/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 71 977 5216: I hope you are as well..
03/01/24, 10:01 am - +263 71 977 5216: As things stand, I canget a 100$ within 7 days.. but I’d probably need until maybe say month end just to be safe, to raise the entire 200$..
And the 30 daysto get the 150$..
03/01/24, 10:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect after 60 minutes for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media page to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/edoofa/
03/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 71 977 5216: Of course.. see you in an hour..
03/01/24, 12:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: A very pleasant afternoon to everyone. I am done with my lunch. Thank you for your patience.
03/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 977 5216: It’s fine..
03/01/24, 1:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tatenda. I would kindly to inform you that under a few genuine conditions, the board is open to giving a certain extension to the student.
03/01/24, 1:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Well i learned that if anything, Edoofa is flexible asfar as being financially understanding goes, for example all the reduced prices from 1750 to 750 to 350..
Andthen ofcourse there’s the EWYL program..
03/01/24, 1:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
03/01/24, 1:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 2:09 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I believe we’re at phase 1..

We’ve ‘discussed’ 1,3,4,5(butnot in detail) and 6..
03/01/24, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
03/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I guess so..
03/01/24, 2:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
03/01/24, 6:41 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Yess.. all is clearer now..
03/01/24, 6:43 pm - +263 71 977 5216: What exactly is a few weeks asper the registration is concerned..
03/01/24, 6:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly elaborate on your query, please?
03/01/24, 6:54 pm - +263 71 977 5216: “Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee *within a few weeks*”

Ideally, what would ‘a few’ weeks look like..
03/01/24, 7:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tatenda. It can be around 3-4 weeks, please. We have a dedicated Admissions Team who will make a affordable and a more convenient plan to suit a student's needs!
03/01/24, 7:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
03/01/24, 7:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

03/01/24, 7:35 pm - +263 71 977 5216: No, you have been a big help as is..
Thank you for the clarification regarding the reg fee..
And for Mrs Ruths’s phone number.. I’m sure my mother @27848819934 wouldlike to talk to her..
03/01/24, 7:40 pm - +263 71 977 5216: And thank you for the video, that was very helpful..
03/01/24, 7:51 pm - +27 84 881 9934: I will talk to her
03/01/24, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Tatenda, and Mrs. Rosemary!
03/01/24, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.

04/01/24, 2:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 2:19 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Im available now sir
04/01/24, 2:21 pm - +27 84 881 9934: I'm not much aware of about this cause but I can say no if Tatenda like it
04/01/24, 2:21 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Can't*
04/01/24, 2:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Rosemary!
04/01/24, 2:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what challenges are you facing with the fee payment timeline, please?
04/01/24, 2:40 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Right now I only have $100 and I am hoping to find another $100 mothend
04/01/24, 2:41 pm - +27 84 881 9934: And the last $150 in 30 days
04/01/24, 2:44 pm - +27 84 881 9934: I'm working as a domestic worker I'm earning very little money per month
04/01/24, 2:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
04/01/24, 2:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
04/01/24, 2:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
04/01/24, 2:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 977 5216: We understand what you’re saying @918350976168..
But what my mother would like to hear is a more clear answer as ro whether or not it wouldbe possible to pay the 200$ for the first part of the enrollment fee at this months end..?
04/01/24, 3:10 pm - +263 71 977 5216: That is of course given that I complete all the other stages/phases and get a confirmation letter with more that 7 days before the months end..
04/01/24, 3:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand from our conversation that there are some challenges for Mrs. Rosemary in meeting the enrollment deadlines. I have taken the liberty of discussing this with the Academic Board, and we have come up with a suitable solution. Would it be convenient for you to discuss this further at your earliest convenience? Your cooperation is highly appreciated.
04/01/24, 3:50 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Thank you we can discuss it even now if possible
04/01/24, 4:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I did discuss about Tatenda's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tatenda's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
04/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Yes, that wouldbe excellent..
04/01/24, 4:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
04/01/24, 4:20 pm - +27 84 881 9934: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 5:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Considering that you have provided comprehensive answers to all the inquiries, the next step in the process involves scheduling a video call with the Program Director. Once I submit the evaluation report for the application of Tatenda, I will promptly arrange suitable time slots for the video call. Could I inquire about your availability for tomorrow to proceed with this arrangement?
04/01/24, 5:47 pm - +27 84 881 9934: I am available tomorrow but probably I will have Data in the afternoon
04/01/24, 5:59 pm - +263 71 977 5216: I will probably not have sufficient data..
But i shall make a plan..
04/01/24, 6:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what time will be available for you, please?
04/01/24, 6:22 pm - +27 84 881 9934: About video call let's say 2 o'clock
04/01/24, 6:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether 4:30 P.M. CAT is convenient for you, please?
04/01/24, 6:24 pm - +27 84 881 9934: Yes it's okay
04/01/24, 6:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your interview has been scheduled for 3:30 P.M. CAT Time Tomorrow. Please set an alarm to ensure you're available at least 10 minutes before the call. Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck!
Additionally, we'll be sharing a letter from our Honorable Director, Mr. Abhinav Gupta, with parents before the interview. Please make sure to go through the document, and as parents, acknowledge it using a voice note. <This message was edited>

06/01/24, 10:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly delve deeper into your career aspirations, please? Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
06/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 977 5216: The career field would be medicine..
More specifically, specialised medicine and surgery..
The kind that comes from doin MBBS..
Then I assume going to medical school to get a graduate degree..
And completing some kind of residency..

My fascination wasimply brought on by research and the fact that I already want to help people so it’s inline with that..
06/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 71 977 5216: But I know the MBBS course isn’t available for multiple reasons..
And I don’t even mind exploring other options..
Which is why  I’d like to know about said ‘Science courses before deciding to dedicate another year to writing advanced level biology..
06/01/24, 10:51 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Science encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues you?
06/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 71 977 5216: It did confuse me when it was written separately from medical science and engineering as if it excluded the 2..
06/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 71 977 5216: There on the application letter..
06/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 71 977 5216: Which courses am i able to take with only Math and Chemistry?
06/01/24, 11:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: There is a wide array of courses which makes it impractical to provide an exhaustive description of each. However, the primary objective of this counseling session is to identify and recommend a course that aligns perfectly with the student's unique career aspirations and goals. Could you kindly delve into your career aspirations apart from Medicine, please?
06/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 977 5216: I don’t believe I really have any..
06/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 977 5216: Would it not be possible to atleast have an idea of what ‘fields’ or even a few courses you can give in this ‘Science’ field.. in which I can do with only math and chem..
06/01/24, 11:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tatenda. May I know whether you are interested in Law or Business, please?
06/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Howlong does it take to become a chartered accountant?
06/01/24, 12:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what fascinates you regarding this peculiar domain, please?
06/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Pure curiosity..
06/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 71 977 5216: But In any case Mr Shashwat, I don’t want to have to switch to a non-science course without exploring my Science based options first..
06/01/24, 3:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you are fascinated with Computers, please?
06/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 71 977 5216: Not really..
06/01/24, 7:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so let us connect at 11:30 am CAT on Monday to resume your session
