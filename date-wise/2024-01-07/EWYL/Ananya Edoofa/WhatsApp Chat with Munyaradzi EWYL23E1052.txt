28/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Munyaradzi, definitely! You see, you have ample time, and you can earn enough scholarship credits to cover your tuition fees! You know, we have a star performer named Persistence; he has earned over 5000 USD and has paid his tuition fees through his credits.
28/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 78 038 1173: That is great news though, I will work hard to get more credits

29/12/23, 1:44 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:47 PM - +263 78 038 1173: That is great news, thank you for your support in advance
29/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 78 038 1173: My name is Munyaradzi Musa. I am a boy at the age of 19 and I am an athlete and a soccer player. I want to develop entrepreneurship skills to help the business world to grow bigger. In addition to that I managed to get 7 subjects at my O level.

2/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Munyaradzi !

Before we dive into today's session, I'm curious – how was your New Year? Did you have a chance to celebrate and welcome the new chapter?
2/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 038 1173: I have celebrated a lot, I thank God for giving me another year to live
2/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, it was good for me as well! 🌟
2/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 038 1173: That side news though
2/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Can you explain on objectives
2/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Noted
2/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Nice to meet you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
2/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Thank you for your support
2/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes
2/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
2/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Great news
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As our session comes to a close, I appreciate our time together today. Let's wrap it up and look forward to continuing our discussion tomorrow at the same time. I'm excited to delve into more interesting topics and explore new ideas.

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Thank you Ms Ananya. This is very helpful
3/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Munyaradzi! 🌞

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Wow wow 😂😂😂💯. Afternoon how are you Ms Ananya

3/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok thanks
3/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
3/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 038 1173: It is difficult for me too
3/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 038 1173: All sections were amazing
3/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
3/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 038 1173: This sounds great Ms Ananya
3/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
3/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I know we couldn't have a fruitful session today as I was preparing for something big coming up! I'll share it with you super soon. Meanwhile, let's conclude our session here and connect tomorrow at the same time!🤝🏽
3/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok thank you Ms Ananya. I was facing network problem here

4/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 038 1173: We may proceed
4/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get to read the document that was shared with you?
4/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I have read the document
4/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
4/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 038 1173: The program will teach me relevant skills. The EWYL program may also make me aware about things and events that happen
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, Great!  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 038 1173: The program also provides me emerging skills
4/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
4/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. I am so happy about your consistency. Maintain this, and I promise that we will excel in this program!
4/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok the document is clarifying that I will be able to get in touch with big technological advanced companies.
4/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok thank you Ms Ananya
5/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Munyaradzi!

5/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Afternoon how are you Ms Ananya
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am good. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 038 1173: The document is clarifying that as a student I have to carry out a research on the type of a company that is financially stable, with a strong founders background and qualifications. I can also you platforms like Google and LinkedIn
5/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 038 1173: In addition to that the company should have a scale of 50 to 200 workers and the company should be either student-centric
5/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
5/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Thank you Ms Ananya

5/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Noted
5/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session 10 minutes earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
5/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 038 1173: Ok, noted
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Munyaradzi!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
