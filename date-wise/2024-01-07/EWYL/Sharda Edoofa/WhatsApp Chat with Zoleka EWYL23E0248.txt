I hope you are doing well

Thank you for reaching out, and I appreciate your dedication to keeping me informed about your current circumstances. I understand that you are currently situated in rural areas facing network challenges, which has impacted your ability to actively participate in your EWYL projects. It's commendable that you are striving to overcome these obstacles.

I empathize with the limitations you are facing, especially regarding the absence of secondary schools in your current location and the difficulty in accessing the LinkedIn app. It's clear that you value your education and the opportunities that programs like Edoofa can offer.

Your commitment to staying determined and ambitious despite these challenges is truly admirable. It's important to acknowledge that circumstances beyond our control can sometimes create roadblocks, but your proactive approach in planning to resume active participation when you relocate to urban areas is a positive step forward.

In the meantime, I encourage you to explore alternative ways to stay engaged with your projects, even in the absence of a stable internet connection. Perhaps you can focus on offline activities or collaborate with local communities to contribute to your projects in meaningful ways.

Remember that setbacks are a part of any journey, and your resilience in facing these challenges will undoubtedly contribute to your personal and professional growth.

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
