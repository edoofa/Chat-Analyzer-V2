3/1/24, 3:46 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Speaking about the Big Day, I can't hold back my excitement! I've spent my entire New Year getting things ready, especially planning my outfits. How about you? What are your expectations for the event? What kinds of events do you think there will be?

Wait, have you even filled out that RSVP form?
3/1/24, 4:33 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now that the time is over, we are wrapping up our scheduled session. Your absense did not go unnoticed and I would also like to understand the reason behind your absense. 

On a brighter note, I'm excited to share that we'll soon have the opportunity to meet in person at our annual conclave during the upcoming Industrial Visit. It promises to be an enriching experience where we can connect face-to-face, network, and delve deeper into our shared interests.

In the meantime, please look out for this week's Wednesday Lesson, which I'll be sharing shortly. It's another opportunity for us to continue our learning journey together.

6/1/24, 10:09 AM - +260 770170108: Has the weather been considered?
6/1/24, 10:22 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Certainly, dressing formally in cold weather requires a bit of thoughtful layering and appropriate clothing. Here are some tips to stay warm while maintaining a formal look:

    Layering:
        Add thermal or insulating layers underneath your formal attire. Thermal shirts or turtlenecks can be discreet yet effective.

    Warm Fabrics:
        Choose clothing items made from warm fabrics like wool or cashmere. A wool suit or dress can provide both warmth and a polished look.

    Outerwear:
        Invest in a stylish coat or overcoat that complements your formal outfit. Make sure it's tailored and adds to the overall sophistication.
6/1/24, 10:24 AM - +260 770170108: Got it
