I hope you are doing well

Since we could not have our session on Monday due to Christmas holiday, *I would like to reschedule our session today at 9:30 am today.* I would like to ensure that you do not miss out on any learning opportunity along with the ongoing festive fun. 

Kindly come to the EWYL Line at 9:30 am confirming you are ready for the session.

I could not attend because I was offline for that matter. I’ve been answering questions and trying to figure out a lot about the EWYL Program but I’ve not been given any feed back about my university stay.
27/12/23, 2:46 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon! It sounds like you've been actively engaged in answering questions and exploring the EWYL Program. I understand it can feel bad not to receive feedback on your university stay. It is helpful to reach out directly to the admission officers to inquire about the status.
27/12/23, 3:27 PM - +260 771923158: Okay thanks you very much let me do so
27/12/23, 3:35 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay John. You are welcome please.
28/12/23, 9:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day!
Kindly come to the EWYL Line since you have a session scheduled there from 9:30am. I am waiting for your message.

As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

29/12/23, 2:10 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Exciting news! With the new year approaching (and guess what, it's our session day!), But don't worry, I have got it all covered. *I have rescheduled that session to Wednesday (3rd jan'2024) at 9:30 am* 🌟 

With the New Year around the corner, we're just a few months away from having you join us here in India. 🇮🇳
 Hence, let's make these sessions our top priority. They're like golden tickets to more scholarship credits and supercharged college prep! 🚀 Your dedication is the secret sauce to our success! 🎓✨
6/1/24, 1:31 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day John
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - +260 771923158: Okay thank you so much
