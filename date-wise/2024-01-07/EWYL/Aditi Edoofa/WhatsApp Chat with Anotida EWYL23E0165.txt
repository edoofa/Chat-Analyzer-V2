As a concerned parent I want to assist my girl child in all her projects/assignments/activities related to this programme. Unfortunately  I haven't seen the projects referred to in this excerpt.  Can you please shed more light on that.
27/12/23, 2:31 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @27714869544 
Hope you are well.

I appreciate your concern and commitment to supporting your girl child in her Edoofa program. The projects and assignments mentioned have already been discussed with her. The 3 projects were discussed in this group only out of which she is supposed to actively work on the 2 projects that is Community Building and African School Reform Mission. 
On the EWYL line there is a lesson sent every week that she has to go through and share her understanding about and an activity related to the lesson is shared on Saturday that she has to submit to upskill herself and there we also discuss her progress and efforts towards the projects.

6/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Anotida

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs*, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
