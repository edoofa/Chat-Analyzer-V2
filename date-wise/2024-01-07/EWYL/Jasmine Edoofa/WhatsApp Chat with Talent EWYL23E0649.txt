2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So last time we were discussing Project 3
Do you remember?
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 871 0127: yes

3. Surprise!! An Additional Opportunity to earn $25 worth of Scholarship Credits when 5 students complete their enrollment from one particular school!
2/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
2/1/24, 2:47 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 71 871 0127: 1. Sandringham High School, not connected to edoofa

2. Greetings my name is Talent Mazarura student of Sandrigham High from 2022 to 2023. I got a chance in the Edoofa Scholarship program for my higher education. With this program l get to have 50 percent of my annual fees covered and can also level up to 100 percent through the use of the EWYL program. The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program offers tasks to do while studying and each task is worth of scholarship credits. I found this opportunity amazing and l would like my former school mates to get such an opportunity therefore l was hoping for Sandringham to be in constant touch with Edoofa to further ease the process of admission in the Edoofa program. let me know your thoughts on connecting your school with Edoofa.
2/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 871 0127: 3.  Norton Mashonaland West
2/1/24, 3:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
2/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah
2/1/24, 3:19 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. 
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
2/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
2/1/24, 3:28 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now. it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. 

*Now, we will meet tomorrow for the session at 1:30 pm.* 
Till then take care and have a great day ahead!
2/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 71 871 0127: Have a nice day
3/1/24, 1:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon*
I hope you are doing well. Let us start our session with a fun question

If your pet could suddenly talk for one day, what do you think they would say or ask you?
3/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 871 0127: ask to go out for a while
3/1/24, 1:54 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It seems like she has a knack for outdoor excitement
3/1/24, 1:54 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing Project 3
Do you remember?
3/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 871 0127: yeah
3/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 871 0127: yes
3/1/24, 1:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
3/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 871 0127: Yeah
3/1/24, 2:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

3/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 871 0127: Okay
3/1/24, 2:28 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Talent, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
3/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 871 0127: sure
3/1/24, 2:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days.
