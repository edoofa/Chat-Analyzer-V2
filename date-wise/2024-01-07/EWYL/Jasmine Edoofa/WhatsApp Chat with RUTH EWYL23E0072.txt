If you have been following our messages, you might have come across read about *SLICE-CON'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa) – an Industrial Visit* curated especially for our students next week. 

The visit is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists and engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation of the official invitation that was sent from our end. *Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?*
6/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 77 337 3312: I think it's a wonderful opportunity for Ruth.
6/1/24, 9:23 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am really happy to know this and I really appreciate your participation in Ruth's EWYL journey
Goodnight!
