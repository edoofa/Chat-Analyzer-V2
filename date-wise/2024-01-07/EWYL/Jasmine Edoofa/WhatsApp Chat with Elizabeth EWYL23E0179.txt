28/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 78 594 6301: Okay
28/12/23, 2:20 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.

28/12/23, 2:23 PM - +263 77 502 8391: Is it all schools or those schools who had produced Edoofians
28/12/23, 2:29 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am sorry what?
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 77 502 8391: Sorry do you have specific schools
28/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 77 502 8391: Or those schools  with Edoofa students
28/12/23, 2:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 78 594 6301: Thanks
28/12/23, 2:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you go through all the information, and see that this can be a million opportunities for your school, then please help me fill out the form so that the Program Director of Edoofa can contact you.

*School Details*:

1. School Name: 
2. School Province: 
3. Name of the contact person: 
4. Designation of the contact person:
5. Whatsapp Number:
6. Year of the establishment of the School: 
7. Pass% of A level (Last Academic year): 
8. No. of teachers in School:
9. The number of students in A level: 
10. Fee structure in A level (Per Term in USD): 
11. Date of Call:
12. Time of the scheduled meeting (CAT):


*Details submitted by*:
1. Full Name:
2. EWYL Group Name: 
3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
28/12/23, 2:40 PM - +263 78 594 6301: Ok
28/12/23, 2:42 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
28/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 78 594 6301: The fees is $450
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
28/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 78 594 6301: Okay
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Elizabeth- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL.

29/12/23, 2:55 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
29/12/23, 2:59 PM - +263 78 594 6301: Okay

29/12/23, 3:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I really wanted to send my warmest wishes your way. 
_May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness_ 🌈

I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. Take care
6/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 594 6301: Ok
