Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society?
29/12/23, 1:40 PM - +263 71 791 4309: How are you doing ma'am today??
29/12/23, 1:45 PM - +263 71 791 4309: I would name it Tatenda 

As for the values and principles of my utopian society would be as follows:

 1.Alcohol will not be allowed.
2.Fornication will not be allowed.
3.There will be monotheism.
4.One men for one women to avoid the spread of diseases such as Hiv and Aids, sexually transmitted diseases.
5.No to early child marriages.
29/12/23, 1:54 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It's fascinating to hear about your vision for the utopian society named Tatenda. The values and principles you've outlined reflect a focus on health, morality, and social responsibility. It seems like you're placing a strong emphasis on promoting well-being and preventing societal issues. Good Job, Mazvita
29/12/23, 1:55 PM - +263 71 791 4309: Thanks ma'am 😊
29/12/23, 1:56 PM - +263 71 791 4309: I have passion in the wellbeing of people and social behavior.
29/12/23, 2:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me introduce you to the EWYL team.
In this group, we have *Miss Sanjana* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.
29/12/23, 2:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: She is not online right now, but she will be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
29/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 71 791 4309: Noted with thanks.
29/12/23, 2:38 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you. <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 2:39 PM - +263 71 791 4309: Am happy to work with her.
29/12/23, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. We must have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
29/12/23, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday*
29/12/23, 2:42 PM - +263 71 791 4309: Understood!
29/12/23, 2:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
29/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 71 791 4309: Noted with thanks.
29/12/23, 2:49 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

29/12/23, 2:50 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
29/12/23, 3:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I really wanted to send my warmest wishes your way. 
_May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness_ 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

6/1/24, 1:34 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:35 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
