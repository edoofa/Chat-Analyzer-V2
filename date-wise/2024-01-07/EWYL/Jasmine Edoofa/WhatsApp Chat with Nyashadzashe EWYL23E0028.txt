5/1/24, 10:35 PM - +264 81 267 7809: Manali is a beautiful town in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, known for its stunning mountain scenery and adventure activities. There are so many amazing things to experience there! You can take a walk through the pine forests, go trekking or camping in the great outdoors, visit one of the local temples or monasteries, or just enjoy the fresh mountain air. Manali is also a great place to try some local cuisine - momos, chow mein, thukpa, and hot chocolate are all must-tries! And if you're feeling really adventurous, you can even go paragliding or river
5/1/24, 10:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That is really great, Nyashadzashe. Now what will be your next destination for a trip?

If you have been following our messages, you might have come across read about *SLICE-CON'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa) – an Industrial Visit* curated especially for our students next week. 

The visit is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists and engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation of the official invitation that was sent from our end. *Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?*
6/1/24, 12:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Most definitely yes
