If you have been following our messages, you might have come across read about *SLICE-CON'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa) – an Industrial Visit* curated especially for our students next week. 

The visit is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists and engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation of the official invitation that was sent from our end. *Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?*
6/1/24, 8:43 PM - +27 73 750 3488: Good evening Jasmine our Edoofa Minister.I am pleased to hear the good news(SLICE -CON' 24) from the Eastern block.Education without training would be incomplete .Let alone knowledge without wisdom has a wide gap.The Edoofian move-engaging my child in the industry gimmicks completes the cycle that is indispensable.l m glad it has been organised so early in her career so that she knows when and how to navigate and encroach the industry lines.I did not know Edoofa enriches their students this far.l wish you all the best in this endeavour.
6/1/24, 9:18 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am really happy to know this and I really appreciate your participation in Leona's EWYL journey
Goodnight!
