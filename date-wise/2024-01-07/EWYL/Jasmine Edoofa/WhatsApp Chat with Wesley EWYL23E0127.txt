3/1/24, 6:23 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening*
I hope you are doing well.

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

*Now, I will meet you in our next session*
Have a great evening!
6/1/24, 1:50 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon my lovely student*_
I wanted to share some exciting news with you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:51 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. 

*When we connect on the 11th of January at 7::00 pm,* I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

*Now, Since it will be a long break, I want you to work hard on the projects and submit 7 applications to me on Thursday.* 
Give it your 100% and I know you can do this. 
Take care
6/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 78 535 0406: Okay thank you
