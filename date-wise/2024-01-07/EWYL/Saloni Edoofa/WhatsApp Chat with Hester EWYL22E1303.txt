27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Hester,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is an advance wish since along with you, our organization will be occupied in New Year celebrations from tomorrow till 1st January, Monday, so I will share your session schedule post that.

I pray for your good health, wealth, and success, and yes,

_*see you next year👋🏼*_

✅I have learnt that Edoofa Program unique program enables the student to bring out the best of themselves. Edoofa provide a program called Earn While You Learn which provide professional challenges practically not only theoretically. In Earn While You Learn program, the students are involved in various skills and then work on projects which are related to employability skills like analytic skills critical thinking and communication skills. 

✅As l want to achieve my goals , l believe that Edoofa Program will help me. I want to be a Geomatic Engineer but due to my family background, we  are poor and my father receives little money which is insufficient,therefore they can't afford my university fee But as Edoofa Program you have a program, Earn While You Learn and l believe that as you accept me my education will proceed. For instance, the program provides opportunities for students to engage in service learning and allow us to gain variable skills while making a positive impact in the community. 
Also l should be accepted so that l can connect with other professionals and like-minded individuals from around the world. Lastly, l should be accepted so that l would develop new skills and knowledge necessary to succeed such as language skills and cultural competency.
