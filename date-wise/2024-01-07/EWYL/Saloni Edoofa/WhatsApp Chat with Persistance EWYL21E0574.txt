29/12/23, 4:21 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻
29/12/23, 4:22 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 4:22 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is an advance wish since along with you, our organization will be occupied in New Year celebrations from tomorrow till 1st January, Monday.
I pray for your good health, wealth, and success, and yes,

_*see you next year👋🏼*_
