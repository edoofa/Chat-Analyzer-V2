29/12/23, 9:02 AM - ~ Tushti added you
4/1/24, 12:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon dear parents and Lucia.

I hope you are doing well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected. I was hoping to get a response from you but it seems that my efforts are in vain now. I have also noticed that you saw my message. Hence if you are getting my responses please let me know so that we can proceed with the admission process. As most of your peers have started or completed their admission process.
4/1/24, 6:05 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Good afternoon
4/1/24, 6:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: How are you doing today?
4/1/24, 6:57 PM - +263 77 466 6432: I'm good thank you
How are you
4/1/24, 7:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
4/1/24, 7:08 PM - +263 77 466 6432: I'm ready
4/1/24, 7:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
4/1/24, 7:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
4/1/24, 8:05 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Yes we are on the same page
4/1/24, 8:05 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Let's proceed
4/1/24, 8:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
4/1/24, 8:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 8:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
4/1/24, 8:23 PM - +263 77 466 6432: I am ready
4/1/24, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
4/1/24, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
4/1/24, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
4/1/24, 8:53 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Noted
4/1/24, 8:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
4/1/24, 8:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
4/1/24, 8:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
4/1/24, 9:01 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Well understood
4/1/24, 9:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
4/1/24, 9:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
4/1/24, 9:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
4/1/24, 9:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow at 2:30 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.
5/1/24, 5:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you in a timely manner as I was on a call. How are you doing this lovely evening?
5/1/24, 6:11 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Good evening ma'am
5/1/24, 6:11 PM - +263 77 466 6432: I am well 
Thank you
5/1/24, 6:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
5/1/24, 6:35 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Let's proceed
5/1/24, 6:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
5/1/24, 6:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
5/1/24, 7:29 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Yes It does
5/1/24, 8:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
5/1/24, 8:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
5/1/24, 8:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
5/1/24, 8:30 PM - +263 77 466 6432: I'm a little bit confused
Can you try to elaborate further
5/1/24, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The above message is an example for December 30th.
5/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Ok I understand
5/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 466 6432: It is now clear
5/1/24, 8:42 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
5/1/24, 8:44 PM - +263 77 466 6432: I need to information
5/1/24, 8:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
5/1/24, 8:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
5/1/24, 8:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
5/1/24, 8:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
5/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 77 466 6432: It's now very clear
5/1/24, 9:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
5/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 77 466 6432: I totally agree
5/1/24, 9:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
5/1/24, 9:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
5/1/24, 9:14 PM - +263 77 466 6432: It's clear
5/1/24, 9:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
5/1/24, 9:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
5/1/24, 9:18 PM - +263 77 466 6432: I have a question
5/1/24, 9:18 PM - +263 77 466 6432: A diploma course will take how long to complete
5/1/24, 9:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It will be depended on the course and it is usually 3 years
5/1/24, 9:22 PM - +263 77 466 6432: So you are saying that if I take a diploma course for three years then for a bachelor I will add for example 4 years to make them 7 years?
5/1/24, 9:22 PM - +263 77 466 6432: And the Edoofa program will still support me?
5/1/24, 9:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct and the number of years depends
5/1/24, 9:24 PM - +263 77 466 6432: For these years I will be studying will I come back to Zimbabwe during those years or I will only come back after I have finished
5/1/24, 9:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You have the option to go back to your home in the semester breaks
5/1/24, 9:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.
5/1/24, 9:28 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Ok I understand
5/1/24, 9:28 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Let's proceed
5/1/24, 9:29 PM - +263 77 466 6432: Thank you and a great night to you too
6/1/24, 1:35 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents of Lucia,
