19/12/23, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:12 PM - +263 78 911 9202: I'm available
19/12/23, 7:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/12/23, 7:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/12/23, 7:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/12/23, 7:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/12/23, 7:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/12/23, 7:33 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Agreed
19/12/23, 7:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
19/12/23, 7:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:30 PM.
19/12/23, 7:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

20/12/23, 1:56 PM - +263 78 911 9202: 3) How does business contribute to the economic development?. Please explain and elaborate.

A business is an organization that undergoes economic activities including trading, manufacturing and retailing.

20/12/23, 1:58 PM - +263 78 911 9202: 4. Explain with an example from your life which shows your managerial talent/skills


I'm a senior prefect at my school,my roles are similar to those of a manager .As a prefect l have the responsibility of controlling that is monitoring the activities of the students àt school which includes making sure that everyone is where they are supposed to be at the right time and place for example making sure everyone is àt the schools sports grounds during the sports hours . Monitoring is a very important part of management as managers are supposed to monitor activities done in an organization so as to keep the organization on track so that it keeps on moving towards it's objectives .A good prefect is also a good leader who leads by example so as to motivate the other students to do well, I'm very punctual on meeting school time and assignment dead lines by so doing l give my fellow students a good trait to follow ,this is crucial for management as managers are supposed to  be figures that motivate their workers into efficiency through their own actions.last but not least as a prefect l have a great responsibility of directing thus giving instructions to the students at my school this includes telling them when and where to go for instance during assembly times we give instructions on what is to be done be it general work or dismissing students during home time. I also have a position at my local church I am the young people's company guide with the responsibility of organizing play time, learning time and instilling discipline in children ages 4 to 14 years of age .My experience as a senior prefect at my school  and a young people'scompany guide at my church has given me an opportunity to see things from a leaders perspective ,it has taught me how to talk to people in a manner that they won't feel pushed but rather a part of something, more over it taught me how to handle situations thus problem solving .
20/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 78 911 9202: 5)Example the importance of human resources in an organization


 A human resources in an organization is a strategic approach to the effective management of an organization's workers so that they help the business gain a competitive advantage. on an organization human resources  (hr) has a role of planning the work force needs of the business that is human resources help in identifying the number of personnels needed in an organization as well as the positions of the personnel needed ,this helps the organization  in employing the right number of employees to meet it's needs thus preventing over staffing this there by reduces over spending and wastage of resources such as money .The human resources in an organization  is very important in recruitment, selection and training of employees,  recruitment is a process of identifying the sources of potential employees , selection is a process of making a choice or identifying those employees who meet the expected standard of the job and lastly training is installing skills and knowledge to a worker all this helps an organization in insuring they have the right and most qualified people working for them,this reduces mistakes in an organization as workers are well equipped and trained which helps in resources saving.The human resources manager is also responsible for health and safety in an organization that is insuring that all working places are safe for workers as well as protecting the workers health this helps the organization because if workers are safe and secure it reduces high labour turn overs as well as rate of absence .last but not least the human resources manager is responsible for measuring and monitoring staff performance,by so doing the organization can easy identify the areas of weakness of it's employees and train them as well as identifying lazy workers who slow down the production of the organization ,this therefore is important to the organization as it can correct it's employees weakness and advance it's straight .These are some of the importance of human resources.
20/12/23, 6:10 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tanyaradzwa!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you earlier as it was past my available hours at the moment. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 6:11 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Ready
20/12/23, 6:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
20/12/23, 6:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20th December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
20/12/23, 6:48 PM - +263 78 911 9202: We paid  350 and an additional 12% on top of the 350 


Do we have to pay again
20/12/23, 6:58 PM - +263 77 289 3917: We were supposed to pay enrolment fee by 4th ,and we did a once off payment of the $350 .
20/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 77 289 3917: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:16 PM - +263 77 289 3917: We paid $395 to Charles Jerera on the 30th of November
20/12/23, 7:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification. There was a clerical error on our end. Yes you have paid the full amount, please.
20/12/23, 7:19 PM - +263 77 289 3917: Thank you,and welcome
20/12/23, 7:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/12/23, 7:21 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Correct
20/12/23, 7:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
20/12/23, 7:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
20/12/23, 7:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
20/12/23, 7:49 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Yes
20/12/23, 7:53 PM - +263 77 289 3917: True
20/12/23, 8:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
20/12/23, 8:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
20/12/23, 8:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
20/12/23, 8:13 PM - +263 77 289 3917: How does it work
20/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
20/12/23, 8:20 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Yes please
20/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
20/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $1200-$1800, and it could be even less. Not more than that. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
20/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Okay we understand
20/12/23, 8:29 PM - +263 77 289 3917: Yes it is
20/12/23, 8:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 8:55 PM - +263 77 289 3917: Thank you
20/12/23, 8:55 PM - +263 78 911 9202: This message was deleted
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Tanyaradzwa!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:03 PM - +263 78 911 9202: We are available
21/12/23, 6:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
21/12/23, 6:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
21/12/23, 6:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
21/12/23, 6:56 PM - +263 78 911 9202: It's clear
21/12/23, 7:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
21/12/23, 7:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
21/12/23, 7:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
21/12/23, 7:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
21/12/23, 7:19 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Okay
21/12/23, 7:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any addional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
21/12/23, 7:55 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Yes please
21/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
21/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
21/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
21/12/23, 8:00 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Understood
21/12/23, 8:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 8:15 PM - +263 78 911 9202: This is very helpful
21/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
21/12/23, 8:20 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Yes
21/12/23, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
21/12/23, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
21/12/23, 8:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
21/12/23, 8:36 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Great so far
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Thank you
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Good afternoon 

May l ask if the financial secure plan is optional
28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. No it is not and it is Mandatory for all the students.
28/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Okay
28/12/23, 7:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to have a discussion about the secure plan with your parents?
28/12/23, 7:35 PM - +263 78 911 9202: We did
28/12/23, 7:49 PM - +263 77 289 3917: Yes had the discussion but have questions
28/12/23, 8:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, please ask.
28/12/23, 8:24 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Our first question would be that do u have official documents about your plan
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Secondly do we pay the 150 with additional percentage for  the cost of transferring the money to India
28/12/23, 8:31 PM - +263 78 911 9202: Your plan is not very flexible to use considering the finance  we earn differ from month to month meaning some other months we can certainly meet 150 but some other time might take time or even fail to reach 150 so being told to pay 150 per month might be very inconvenient and a disadvantage to us, rather than saving our own money at our own pace saving 150 , exceeding or not reaching according to how we earn that month
28/12/23, 8:31 PM - +263 78 911 9202: To know if it is official
28/12/23, 8:47 PM - +263 77 289 3917: Since the program is for 2025 intake ,
1. Am I assured that a place at a good university will be guaranteed and that BBA will be the course  and no changes from  the course  preferred. 

2.The $150 per month that will be paid over 20 months,will it earn interest over the 20 months ,if so what percentage, simple interest or compound. 

3. If one is not flexible with $150  per month but can pay different amounts depending on what will have been raised that particular  month but in the end,say after 10 months you expect 1500 ,and I also make sure l raise 1500 in the 10 months is that possible or it's just strictly 150 and no deviation from that.

29/12/23, 7:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Tanyaradzwa. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

According to your questions here are your answers. 

1. Yes you will be guaranteed a seat at the university with your chosen course. And if that does not happen the full amount that you have spent by that time will be refunded.
2. There will be no interest. 
3. The amount will  not be flexible.
29/12/23, 7:37 PM - +263 78 911 9202: I have spoken to a couple of friends who are already there and some coming this year they have no idea about this plan is it new
29/12/23, 7:57 PM - +263 77 289 3917: Your secure plan is one sided,
1.how can one keep money aside for 20 months without interest, if l had the money on me in those 20 months l would have used it to generate more and that's an advantage. 
2.incase the place is not offered you are saying l will be refunded,this is just your word and nothing written down or a referral  place where l will go and claim the refund in case you just keep quiet, remember all there is between us is just whatsapp messages and I can never use these to get a refund.
3.none of your edoofians know about such a plan.

2/1/24, 9:27 PM - +263 77 289 3917: Not a flexible  plan at all, more consultations  need to be done so that people can accept  such a plan.surely 3000 is quiet an amount that you can ask a parent to pay and hope that if need arises it will be refunded without questions,I very well don't think I am the only parent from Zimbabwe who is not eager to get into such a plan with loopholès
