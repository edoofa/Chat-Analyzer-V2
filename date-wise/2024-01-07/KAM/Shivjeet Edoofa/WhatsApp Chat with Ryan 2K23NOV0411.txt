I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 6:31 PM - +263 77 382 4365: We are all well

With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months.

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes
3/1/24, 7:43 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Sorry to answer you late.I think you can proceed
3/1/24, 7:55 PM - +263 71 726 1775: We are of the view that Ryan must work hard and score very high so that he will be given a high scholarship percentage.We him to score veryhigh
3/1/24, 8:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
3/1/24, 8:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
3/1/24, 8:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
4/1/24, 6:07 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Sounds good
4/1/24, 6:21 AM - +263 71 726 1775: I understand you say in the eleventh month we will be asked to open MasterCard bank account here in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. This account will help in Visa application.
You say depositing $1500 for the remaining 10 months might be expensive. So we will deposit only for four months. How much will that be? And when will the balance from $1500 paid?
4/1/24, 8:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That will be a total of $150 x 4 which is $600.
