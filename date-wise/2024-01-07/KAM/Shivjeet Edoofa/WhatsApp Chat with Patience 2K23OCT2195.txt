29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Patience

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - +263 77 133 7570: Doing well this side, how are you doing
29/12/23, 4:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. If you are comfortable shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 77 133 7570: Please proceed
29/12/23, 5:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
29/12/23, 5:20 PM - +263 77 133 7570: Yes, all information recalled: deposits for 10 months, in your Account then 4 months deposits in FBC account, both $150 per month.
29/12/23, 6:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 6:32 PM - +263 77 133 7570: We have understood the plan and we even appreciate but we choose to save the money with ourselves from the first month.
29/12/23, 6:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I would like to let you know that the above plan is mandatory for all the students.
29/12/23, 7:08 PM - +263 77 133 7570: So when are we expected to make the first deposit
29/12/23, 7:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: we can commence that from the next month.
29/12/23, 8:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for taking the time and being online with me today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing the session for today and let us connect on the 2nd of January.

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a furitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admisison process for today?
2/1/24, 6:34 PM - +263 77 339 1635: Yes
2/1/24, 7:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
