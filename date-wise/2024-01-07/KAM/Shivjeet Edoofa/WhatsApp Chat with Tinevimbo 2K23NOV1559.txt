19/12/23, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:45 PM - +263 78 327 3322: Lets proceed
19/12/23, 7:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great to hear that you've taken note of the second form as well. Now, moving on to the third and final form:

*3. EWYL Program Instructions and Pledge Document:* In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey. The next batch is scheduled to start on Tuesday (26th December). If you are enthusiastic about beginning the procedures on that particular date, please fill it in accordingly. However, if you are unavailable to commence your EWYL Journey on that date, please inform us, and we will propose an alternative date for the next session. Our aim is to align this with your availability to ensure a smooth transition.

19/12/23, 7:51 PM - +263 78 327 3322: We are heading for christmas holiday and we wont be available online. I propose if we can start the sessions first week of January

1. Letter of recommendation
2. O Level Certificate 
3. Personal ID or Passport or Birth derticifate.
19/12/23, 7:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
19/12/23, 7:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
19/12/23, 8:13 PM - +263 78 327 3322: This can only be processed when schools are open that is next year.
19/12/23, 8:13 PM - +263 78 327 3322: We will try to push so that latest end of Jamuary we can get the letter.
