29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Ashley

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 6:55 PM - +263 78 265 9728: We are fine Sir, how were your Christmas holidays?
29/12/23, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It was great, how was yours?
29/12/23, 7:00 PM - +263 78 265 9728: Not all that bad, Zim situation.
29/12/23, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's a simpler breakdown:

Enrollment Fees: You paid $350, but this amount gets deducted from the overall fees you owe. So, it's like a discount.
Registration Fees: You'll pay between $500-$1000.
Deposit: $1500 to be paid in 10 months.
Additional Fees after Visa Payment: $900.
The total of all these payments adds up to $3,250. Now, the confusion arises because this exceeds the expected total fees for the year, given the 50-100% scholarship.

The scholarship's role is to reduce the amount you have to pay. Even if you've made some payments already, the scholarship could cover or reimburse part or all of these expenses:

Enrollment Fees: Already paid, but it's deducted from the total fees.
Registration Fees: The scholarship might cover part or all of this.
Deposit & Visa Payment Fees: These might also be included in what the scholarship covers.
So, although you've paid some fees upfront, the scholarship should eventually decrease the total amount you're supposed to pay. It might not be immediately visible in the payments you've made, but it should affect your final expenses after the scholarship adjustments are applied.

2/1/24, 6:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Eevning dear parent and my dear student!

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a furitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admisison process for today?
2/1/24, 7:33 PM - +263 77 749 1315: Evening, yes we are ready
2/1/24, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
2/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 77 749 1315: By tomorrow we will be done
2/1/24, 8:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
