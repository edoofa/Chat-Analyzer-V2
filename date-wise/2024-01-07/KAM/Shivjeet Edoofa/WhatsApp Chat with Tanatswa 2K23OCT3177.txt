19/12/23, 6:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tanatswa!

I hope you are doing well today. Thank you for your patience. Please pardon me for not being able to connect with you recently. I was occupied with university officials and tasked with a campus visit.  You will be provided with the EWYL details very soon, the mentors are currently shorting out the allocations for now.
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Tanatswa

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 77 368 2556: We are fine Sir, how are you
29/12/23, 6:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
29/12/23, 7:01 PM - +263 77 368 2556: Yes,  we can
29/12/23, 7:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 7:25 PM - +263 77 368 2556: Yes , i have understood
29/12/23, 8:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 8:07 PM - +263 77 368 2556: Okay Sir, I will let you know once we have discussed the issue with my family
29/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on the 2nd of January to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
