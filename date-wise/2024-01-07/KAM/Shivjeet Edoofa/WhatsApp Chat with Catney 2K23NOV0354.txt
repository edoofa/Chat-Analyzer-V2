29/12/23, 4:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
29/12/23, 4:37 PM - +263 78 236 0276: For the  admission processs lasted on monthly subscription to payed monthly for 10 months with a figure of $150 usd
29/12/23, 4:41 PM - +263 78 236 0276: Understood
29/12/23, 4:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 78 236 0276: Let's schedule for the January second
29/12/23, 4:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, that can be done.
