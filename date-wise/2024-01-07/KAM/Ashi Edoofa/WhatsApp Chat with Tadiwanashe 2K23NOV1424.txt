26/12/23, 11:47 AM - +263 78 128 5777: Good morning
26/12/23, 12:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe, Wishing you a good day!
26/12/23, 12:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: How are you doing @263781285777 ?
26/12/23, 12:29 PM - +263 78 128 5777: l am fine ma'am how are you
26/12/23, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you are doing fine dear, I am doing good thank you for asking.
26/12/23, 12:30 PM - +263 78 128 5777: same to you hope you had a great Christmas
26/12/23, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263781285777 With this said, May I know if you are available for the discussion?
26/12/23, 12:32 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes please
26/12/23, 12:32 PM - +263 78 128 5777: It was scheduled for 2:00pm though
26/12/23, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation dear, we can continue with the session now if you are comfortable otherwise we can continue at 2:00 PM.
26/12/23, 12:34 PM - +263 78 128 5777: No it's okay we can continue
26/12/23, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263781285777. As I was going through your conversation with Mr. Shivjeet, I am sure you have understood the benefits of Endowment Plan. Shall we continue from there?
26/12/23, 12:36 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes please
26/12/23, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/12/23, 12:40 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Can you please provide information
26/12/23, 12:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 12:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/12/23, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/12/23, 12:43 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes
26/12/23, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/12/23, 12:45 PM - +263 78 128 5777: thats amazing
26/12/23, 12:46 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes it is quite impossible
26/12/23, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/12/23, 12:51 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yeah they are pretty tough calls to make
26/12/23, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263781285777. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
26/12/23, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/12/23, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/12/23, 12:53 PM - +263 78 128 5777: okay
26/12/23, 12:54 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes ma'am
26/12/23, 12:55 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Therefore one needs 6 points and about to get a scholarship sit
26/12/23, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 12:58 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes ma'am
26/12/23, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
26/12/23, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/12/23, 1:02 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Okay noted
26/12/23, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 1:04 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Can l please get clarity on the amounts and how they should be paid,,, The instalments and everything related to getting higher education
26/12/23, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'll be more than happy to assist you dear, Before that I am sure that you must be aware that your total cost of education range is $2000 to $3000 and your registration cost is between $500 to $1000, right?
26/12/23, 1:07 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes ma'am
26/12/23, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation dear, Now as we proceed with your application you will soon receive the offer letter from the university. For the registration process, you need to pay the registration amount which is $1000 in order to reserve your scholarship seat. However, with the endowment benefit you have a grant of $100 which means you need to pay $900 for the registration fees. Along with this, For the registration amount we do have flexible payment plan which was shared with you earlier. May I know if you are aware of the same?
26/12/23, 1:14 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes l am aware
26/12/23, 1:15 PM - +263 78 128 5777: That we pay the first 450 within the deadline of the university and the remaining in a period of 30 to 45 days
26/12/23, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263781285777. I am glad to see that you remember the payment plan. With this said, May I know if you have any other question?
26/12/23, 1:17 PM - +263 78 128 5777: However l would like to know if the universities gives us time to choose which one we want  before declaring a deadline
26/12/23, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
26/12/23, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
26/12/23, 1:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
26/12/23, 1:21 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes
26/12/23, 1:21 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes ma'am
26/12/23, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by University B, you would lose out on the scholarship from University B and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
26/12/23, 1:22 PM - +263 78 128 5777: There is Galgotias
26/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Noh l am not
26/12/23, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with the university A by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at  university A without risking losing out on the scholarship.
26/12/23, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to University A to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University B where your registration fee is again $1000 .

If you wish to change your university to University B, in that case, one is to pay $1000 , but because you would have already paid $1000 for University A , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University B and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
26/12/23, 1:26 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Ohhh very well, Edoofa will guide me through out. How does one get to know of other universities ofgers
26/12/23, 1:27 PM - +263 78 128 5777: offers

26/12/23, 1:38 PM - +263 78 128 5777: No ma'am

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 78 128 5777: The excitement is overwhelming 🍂🍃the wait keeps one in suspense and the relief that comes after receiving the letter is unmeasurable
6/1/24, 12:12 PM - +263 78 128 5777: That will be very much appreciated because it is a crucial part and step to accessing hight education
6/1/24, 12:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263781285777 . As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 12:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 12:23 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Very well then
6/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes ma'am with great enthusiasm
6/1/24, 12:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 12:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
6/1/24, 12:34 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Thank you ma'am
6/1/24, 12:37 PM - +263 78 128 5777: 1. 900 $
2.3 years
3.300$
4.750$
6/1/24, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
6/1/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes ma'am
6/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
6/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
6/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
6/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Very well
6/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Ohh that's interesting
6/1/24, 1:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
6/1/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes it does and the consideration of the university is quite pleasing
6/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear,  Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
6/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes ma'am it is clear
6/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
6/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 19th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
6/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Ohh that's amazing
6/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes we are
6/1/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes please
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 19th 2024.*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 128 5777: yes ma'am
6/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 128 5777: ohhh this is amazing, it is quite flexible and affordable
6/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes
6/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Ohh that is interesting
6/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 128 5777: okay ma'am thank you
6/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 128 5777: noted
6/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Will the 750 be extended to the  first semester fee?
6/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263781285777 The registration fees will be adjusted in your first year tuition fees.
6/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
6/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Very well then ma'am.
Thank you
6/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Ohh that's reassuring thank you
6/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
6/1/24, 2:16 PM - +27 63 079 6668: I'm  Nashe's father im also doing  follow  ups  on your  chats  I'm here in South  Africa how can I do the payments  from here

6/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Ohhh okay noted, l don't think that will be necessary since l still have the details
6/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Meaning we can still use mama money  as a foreign currency bank account
6/1/24, 2:24 PM - +27 63 079 6668: Cool
6/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Nice to connect with you @27630796668, Yes you can use MAMA Money for the payment.
6/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
6/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Noted
6/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Will my A level results change my scholarship
6/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Or that will be entirely on the school "Galgotias" in question
6/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263781285777 The scholarship percentage is decided by the university, In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now?
6/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Ohhh it is clear now, thank you for the clarity  that will be all
6/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
6/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
6/1/24, 2:59 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Noted
6/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes l am aware
6/1/24, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
6/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Yes, it is quite advantageous as ones hardwork pays off
6/1/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
6/1/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
6/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 128 5777: Thst is assuring
6/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 78 128 5777: No l don't have any queries
6/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 78 128 5777: You can as well share the insights
