5/1/24, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

5/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
5/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
5/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
5/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes they are
5/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
5/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
5/1/24, 12:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

5/1/24, 12:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/1/24, 12:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
5/1/24, 12:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
5/1/24, 12:50 PM - +263 78 724 4398: How does the AAL help me attain a visa exactly?
5/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263787244398 In order to apply for your Visa, The Embassy needs the document to verify the reason for which you need Visa. Hence, You will need the official documents from the university that's why you need the AAL. I hope you understand ? <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes understood
5/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
5/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes
5/1/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.

5/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I've gone through all the videos
5/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos and you have shared good insights as well. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
5/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
5/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
5/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
5/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
5/1/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
5/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes I was
5/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
5/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes we are on the same page
5/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:00 PM.
5/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
5/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
5/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 724 4398: The tasks will be completed by tomorrow 12PM
5/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to complete them. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
5/1/24, 1:56 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Thank you
5/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome, Precious!

6/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 724 4398: 2.Is there such a thing as a social structure that contains individual action,or is society nothing more than a fragment of our imaginations?
 
For it to be a social structure it has to be of team effort , because a structure isn't made up of one part, take a house for a example, it needs cement, bricks and sand they are all if of equal value into building strong structure (a house)
Another good example 
Is what we call (Zibuthe )In our Ndebele culture, this is were by the community donates money to assist a community member who has encountered the tragedy of losing a family member (death)
I think this on its own shows that a social structure does not contain individual action but team effort.

Society can not be a fragment of our imagination because the people and their contributions to it make up society
6/1/24, 11:48 AM - +263 78 724 4398: 3.Please explain the relation between sociology and economics

Economics is an age-old institution used to deal with the changing patterns in society. Sociology deals with the relationship between humans and society. Economics helps understand the pattern of want and consumption of resources whilst the focus of study in sociology is society and the behaviour of humans in society.Hence there is a relationship in the terms that the  wants and needs of people and their consumption determines their change of behaviour and adoptions of new value.For instance the dress code
6/1/24, 11:51 AM - +263 78 724 4398: 4.what is the role of institutions in society - do they perform positive functions or simply work in the interests of the powerful and against the powerless?

Institutions are a part of the social order of society and they govern behaviour and expectations of individuals, while at the same time they regulate business operations and ethics. In fact, the morality of institutions is guaranteed by the process of social evolution. Therefore, Institutions play an important role by reducing uncertainties and establishing a stable economy and social relations. Through formal rules and informal norms and traditions, institutions determine what is acceptable and unacceptable to a society

I think it's positive because they stabilize the society, in terms of social and economic expectations
They regulate the behaviors of everyone in society as they are expected to behave in a particular way
6/1/24, 11:54 AM - +263 78 724 4398: I'm afraid I do not have an answer to No.5
6/1/24, 12:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Precious, Wishing you a good day!
6/1/24, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I kindly know if you have done a research for the question?
6/1/24, 12:09 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I have asked around,no one seems to he the answer  and I'm not connected to the internet
6/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Good afternoon
6/1/24, 12:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please do a research today and share your response with us.
6/1/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (12-Jan-2024).
6/1/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/KVPFXySUQ6q50DZSGnhn5U
6/1/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Precious Sukoluhle Kapfumvuti, and my EWYL group name is Precious EWYL23E1078. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (12-Jan-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
6/1/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
6/1/24, 12:15 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Okay noted
6/1/24, 12:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
6/1/24, 12:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
6/1/24, 12:24 PM - +263 78 724 4398: We are still preparing to pay for the remaining sum
6/1/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
6/1/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Sociology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes that is correct
6/1/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
6/1/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
6/1/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
6/1/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
6/1/24, 12:38 PM - +263 78 724 4398: That is correct
6/1/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
6/1/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
6/1/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
6/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes
6/1/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
6/1/24, 12:56 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes we are
6/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
6/1/24, 1:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
6/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I have
6/1/24, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
6/1/24, 1:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
6/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Okay noted
6/1/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
6/1/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
6/1/24, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Okay noted
6/1/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
6/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I would like to know know what the costs will be for my admission process and higher education
6/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, The cost of education for your Higher Education is the range of $2000 - $3000 and the registration fees will be in the range of $500  - $1000
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 724 4398: That where the scholarship assists me right,?
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 724 4398: With the cost for higher education
6/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, You will get the better understanding when you will receive your offer letter from the university
6/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Okay noted
6/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
6/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
6/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
6/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes indeed
6/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

6/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 724 4398: We may proceed
6/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
6/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

6/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 724 4398: That is good to hear......I am thrilled
6/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
6/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
6/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
6/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I understand
6/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
6/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
6/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes it does
6/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
6/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
6/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 30, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 30, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
6/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I'm following perfectly
6/1/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
6/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 78 724 4398: You may provide me with the information
6/1/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
6/1/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
6/1/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
6/1/24, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
6/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Understood, that is clear
6/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
6/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 78 724 4398: That is correct yes
6/1/24, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
6/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes I do agree
6/1/24, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
6/1/24, 4:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
6/1/24, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
6/1/24, 4:44 PM - +263 78 724 4398: That is good
I am clear with that
6/1/24, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
6/1/24, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
6/1/24, 4:51 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes I am
6/1/24, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
6/1/24, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
6/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Interesting
6/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Okay noted
6/1/24, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
6/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Everything is clear
6/1/24, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
6/1/24, 4:57 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I am excited
