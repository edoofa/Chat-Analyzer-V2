6/1/24, 3:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chantell,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, an Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Alongside Ms. Vilsha, Head of Admissions at Edoofa, I am thrilled to be a part of your university admission journey.

Now that you've successfully completed your enrollment formalities, the commencement of your admission journey is scheduled for January 08th, 2024, starting at 12:30 PM. To ensure a productive discussion, please ensure a smooth internet connection for the session.
6/1/24, 3:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In this one-hour session, I, as your dedicated admission officer, will connect with you to explore your academic journey, understand your experiences, and gather essential information for your scholarship application. I'll also discuss your daily availability for future sessions. Count on me to guide you through the initial steps and address any queries you may have.

Simultaneously, I am providing you with two essential forms which are to be filled out during our session on January 08th. To stay proactive, please print these forms in advance and have them ready for the session. I will guide you on filling them out during our discussion.
6/1/24, 3:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's crucial to print out these forms before our reconnection on January 08th, as the next batch for the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program is scheduled for January 16th. Starting from our sessions on the 08th, we aim to complete your initial admission formalities and provide guidance on the steps needed before January 3rd. Timely completion of these steps is vital for your EWYL Program commencement on January 16th. Failure to do so may result in a delay in your journey. Please understand the importance of printing out the forms in advance and ensure you do so.
6/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If your parents or any family member responsible for your higher education is not yet part of the group, kindly ensure they join your admission group before our session on Monday using this link - https://chat.whatsapp.com/GA6XQcb1l81HAKc9AWEdmD
