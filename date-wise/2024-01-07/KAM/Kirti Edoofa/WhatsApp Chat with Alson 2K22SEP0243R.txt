I hope you're doing well. I've been awaiting a response from you but haven't received an update yet. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as today is your deadline and you shared that you will be making the deposit on the 26th. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Could you please let me know if you were able to complete the payment today? Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements? <This message was edited>
