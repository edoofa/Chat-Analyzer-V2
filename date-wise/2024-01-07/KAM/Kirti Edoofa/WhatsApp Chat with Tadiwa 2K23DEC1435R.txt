4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.

The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
21/12/23, 4:03 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes we may start

21/12/23, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/12/23, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.

21/12/23, 4:49 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss. I understand
21/12/23, 4:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the picture, it is noted with us.
21/12/23, 4:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
21/12/23, 4:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
21/12/23, 5:00 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yess indeed.
21/12/23, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
21/12/23, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
21/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes they are clear thank you.
21/12/23, 5:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

In video 2, I understood that not onky does Edoofa offer high education at affordable prices, it also helps to increase students' capacity for success making students responsible and independent.
In video 3, I understood that Edoofa invests a lot of time inorder to find suitable schools or universities for Edoofians to study. They also help choose universities with vibrant culture.Attitude, Skills amd Knowledge are required in the process
In the last video i understood that a statement of purpose is an important document which allows a unique opportunity for students to convince any university why they should be accepted and it should include one's goals, vision and academic progress. Thank you.
21/12/23, 7:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
21/12/23, 7:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
21/12/23, 7:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
21/12/23, 7:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
21/12/23, 7:54 PM - +263 71 438 9968: I understand thank you.

21/12/23, 8:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

6/1/24, 10:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?

3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
6/1/24, 10:44 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes.We may proceed
6/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 71 438 9968: 1. $1000

4. 125
5. 1000
6/1/24, 10:56 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 75% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
6/1/24, 11:03 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Yes it is.Thank you so much
6/1/24, 11:06 AM - +263 77 330 0932: Good morning Admission team. Thank you for your time in taking care of our queries. However, I wanted to find out if other universities are going to respond as well before we accept this offer.
6/1/24, 11:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773300932 I have taken note of your query, and as we move forward with the discussion your query shall be answered however, for now, let us focus on understanding the letter better so that you have a clear understanding of the offer letter.
6/1/24, 11:14 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Okay
6/1/24, 11:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
6/1/24, 11:22 AM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $2250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $2500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $2250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - +263 71 438 9968: I understand
6/1/24, 11:25 AM - +263 77 330 0932: I understand, but on the letter they're stating that it's 100% scholarship
6/1/24, 11:30 AM - +263 77 330 0932: On accommodation,  does she has to stay on campus only. Is there an option of staying out of campus?
6/1/24, 11:34 AM - +263 77 330 0932: On the issue of commencing studies, when is she expected to be in India?
6/1/24, 3:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns I have taken a note of all your queries and I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion.
