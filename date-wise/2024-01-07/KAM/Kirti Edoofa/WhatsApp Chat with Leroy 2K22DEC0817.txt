I hope this message reaches you in good health. *I am Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Please excuse Mr. Shivjeet for his unavailability this week, as he is engaged in meetings with university officials. In the meantime, I am here to assist you with any concerns or questions you may have.
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: First of all. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
28/12/23, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind and thoughtful message. It's heartening to hear about your positive view of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and your appreciation for the efforts we made to accommodate your educational aspirations. I understand that deciding not to continue with your plans to study in India or elsewhere is a significant decision, and it must not have been easy for you. Please know that your decision is respected. However, for us to have clarity could you please help me understand the sudden change in your plans, maybe this will help me understand you better?
29/12/23, 7:41 PM - +263 71 422 2943: My pleasure ma'am. I plan to venture into business here in Zimbabwe without including higher education. Of course higher education in a prestigious country like India is of great value, though pursuing in business is heartfelt and right for me. I nolonger want the program l have chosen. All this will help in my favor and my parents' too since money is being a difficulty to them. Hence, l can lessen their burden through this plan which will also be part of my long term goals.

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful New Year celebration. 
Thank you for sharing your thoughts and plans. It's clear that you've given considerable thought to your decision to venture into business in Zimbabwe, prioritizing it over higher education at this time. Your choice to follow a path that feels right and heartfelt to you is commendable.
4/1/24, 4:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, I'm curious to know more about how you envision this business venture contributing to your career development. How do you see this step fitting into your overall career aspirations? Do you have specific business ideas or sectors you are passionate about?
5/1/24, 5:54 AM - +263 71 422 2943: Greetings!!
The business does not contribute to the career l once wanted to pursue in. It was something in me though l wanted to go through higher education first but after considering the financial status at home and also the years l would have been in university against what l can achieve if only l have the capital to venture into this business in those three years it would be meaningful to me. Of course l have specific business ideas that l am passionate about and with God's grace they can be achieved without going for higher education.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that with me. Certainly, Leroy, I completely comprehend that under the given circumstances, you might naturally lean toward the decision to withdraw from the scholarship. If this is the choice you've made, I fully respect your decision. However, there's still a question that is unanswered regarding the initial reasons behind your enrollment. When your parents enrolled you, they undoubtedly had specific aspirations or reasons in mind. If it's not too much to ask, could you kindly share with me what initially motivated you to pursue higher education in India?

Growing up I always wanted to study abroad for my higher education but did not think that it would actually come true. Therefore, when l came to know about Edoofa, I fell in love with India because its educational system is highly recommended as proven by many world reknowned people it has produced. Also, I knew India as the third richest country globally, having Edoofa providing employability and psychology being one of the finest jobs in India( which l wanted to pursue in), learning there was very significant. Lastly, l have always loved India for its culture so learning there would have been such a wonderful and remarkable experience.
