6/1/24, 10:30 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Getrude,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
6/1/24, 10:30 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 10:31 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes we did
6/1/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 10:32 AM - +260 96 3297443: Yes we did
6/1/24, 10:32 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes madam
6/1/24, 10:33 AM - +260 96 3297443: Sure
6/1/24, 10:37 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -
6/1/24, 10:37 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3. Misc And Uniform Fee (applicable for first year)
4. University Exam fee [Per annum]
5) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
6/1/24, 10:42 AM - +260 97 2413156: 1.$1100
2.$700
3.i didn't see it in the newsletter
4.not mentioned
5.$1000
6/1/24, 10:50 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 10:50 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes now I see it
6/1/24, 10:52 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1100.

Along with this, there is a $50 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $50 to the per annum tuition fee of $1100, the total comes out to be $1150.
6/1/24, 10:52 AM - +260 97 2413156: Sure.
6/1/24, 10:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.

Normal Seater
With Attached Washroom and Kitchen
6/1/24, 10:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: If a student wishes to get a more affordable accommodation, they can stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
6/1/24, 10:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $600 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1150  + $600 = $1750. I hope you are clear about this?
6/1/24, 10:54 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes
6/1/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.
6/1/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
6/1/24, 10:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
6/1/24, 11:00 AM - +260 96 3297443: This sounds good 🙏
6/1/24, 11:00 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes
6/1/24, 11:00 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.
6/1/24, 11:01 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1750 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1750 - $1000 = $750 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
6/1/24, 11:02 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes
6/1/24, 11:03 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
6/1/24, 11:03 AM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 11:04 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes sure
6/1/24, 11:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$450 before the first deadline date of January 20th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of February 20th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date). <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 11:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 20th 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 11:07 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes it is very clear
6/1/24, 11:17 AM - +260 96 3297443: It's clear so we can make the payment of $450 before the first deadline of January 20th then the balance will pay in February 20th so ,so since the bank details for the school are on the acceptance letter so will will transfer direct to the school account?
6/1/24, 11:19 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @260963297443 yes please you can certainly make the deposit before the deadline, and yes we are coming on to the payment mode as well.
6/1/24, 11:19 AM - +260 96 3297443: Ok thanks 🙏
6/1/24, 11:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 11:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 10% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
6/1/24, 11:22 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - +260 96 3297443: Yes we will then use the local office here penmal connect
6/1/24, 11:28 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, let me share the account details just for your reference:

*Account Name* - Penmal Connect Limited
*Account Number* - 0222030000591
*Name of Bank* - Indo Zambia Bank
*Branch Name* - Jacaranda

6/1/24, 11:30 AM - +260 96 3297443: Sure we shall use this account since it's weekend already we shall do the payment between Wednesday and Friday this coming week 🙏
6/1/24, 11:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
6/1/24, 11:33 AM - +260 97 2413156: No I don't
6/1/24, 11:33 AM - +260 96 3297443: We are clear
6/1/24, 11:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In that case, let me also tell you a bit about the Quest Group of institutions. It is the most ideal destination for international students interested in studying in India. They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
6/1/24, 11:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It has a Unique Mentorship program to encourage students to do well according to their abilities and strengths and has been awarded Outstanding Technical Institution of North India during the World Education Summit and Awards.
