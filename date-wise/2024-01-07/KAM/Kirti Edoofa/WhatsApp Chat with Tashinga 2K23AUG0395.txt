28/12/23, 5:51 PM - +27 79 803 5710: Good evening Kirti. I pray you are well. May we please have the Money order so that we can make the first payment for the registration fees. Thank you
28/12/23, 6:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Parents and Tashinga.

I hope you are doing well. I just received an update from the accounts team. Regarding the order, you must be aware that there is a monthly account transaction limit for Mama Money. I just checked with the accounts team and they mentioned that the Mama Money's Limit for this month has been reached due to a higher number of students joining the program from South Africa. <This message was edited>

3/1/24, 2:38 PM - +27 79 803 5710: Noted mam.
6/1/24, 5:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Tashinga,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I wanted to reach out and inform you that our accounts team is diligently working on your payment confirmation once we get an update we shall let you know in the meantime I was able to inquire with the accounts team to share the payment break down so that you can have a clarity too.
6/1/24, 5:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To assist you further and provide clarity on the breakdown of your university registration fee, we have requested the accounts team to provide a summary. We have made every effort to obtain this information, and we are now ready to share it with you. Please find the details below, and kindly review them. If you come across any discrepancies or have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out. However, if everything appears to be in order, please confirm that you have received and acknowledged the provided information.
6/1/24, 5:36 PM - +27 79 803 5710: Noted
6/1/24, 5:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Name of Student: Tashinga Mambo
University Name: Galgotias University

Registration Fee Due: $750
Endowment Grant: $100
Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $750 - $100 = $650

Payment Mode Used: Mama money
International Transfer Charges: $0 (0% of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $650 + $0 = $650

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $261 (Paid on 02nd Jan 2024) + $58 (Paid on 2nd Jan 2024)

Balance Amount Due: $650 - $319 = $331

As per the payment plan shared by the university, the remaining balance of $331 is to be paid on or before the due date of 3rd february 2024. It's worth noting that the earlier you make this payment, the sooner you'll be able to complete your university admission process.
6/1/24, 5:44 PM - +27 79 803 5710: Noted and it seems correct. From our conversion this side from rand to dollar we had thought that we had deposited 325 but I guess from your side changing Rupees to dollar it becomes slightly different. If possible for the next payment, if you may please send us the amount we should pay in Rupees so that when I convert on mama money I send the right amount. Thank you mam
6/1/24, 5:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely @27798035710 we will do that have a blessed weekend ahead.
6/1/24, 7:23 PM - +27 73 199 8986: Thank you
