26/12/23, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ashley,

I trust this message finds you in good health and that you had a delightful Christmas. Following up on our earlier discussion, I understand that you are scheduled to make a deposit on the 29th of December. I'm reaching out to check on your preparations and to ask if there are any updates or progress you'd like to share with us?
27/12/23, 9:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Ashley,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you above. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message @263773508876 @263714008973 ?
28/12/23, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ashley.

I hope you're doing well. I've been awaiting a response from you but haven't received an update yet. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as tomorrow is your deadline. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Could you please let me know if we are still in communication? Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements?
28/12/23, 8:25 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Good evening. I just arrived from home for maNyaradzo of my late father Mr Amon Bwititi Mubako. I just arrived in Murambinda and on Saturday l intend to pay the money
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Saturday or Sunday
28/12/23, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for updating me. I understand you might be out of town, but considering Ashley's deadline is tomorrow, I'm a bit confused about your plan to make the payment on Saturday. Could you please clarify your reasoning for this timing?
29/12/23, 8:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ashley.

I hope you're doing well. I've been awaiting a response from you but haven't received an update yet. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as today is your deadline and you shared that you will be making the deposit today. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Could you please let me know if you were able to complete the payment today? Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements?
30/12/23, 8:46 AM - +263 71 400 8973: Morning. Yes send the Mrs Rajan's details
30/12/23, 8:47 AM - +263 77 350 8876: Morning. Is Mr Rajan back in the country
2/1/24, 12:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 1:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, @263773508876 Mr. Rajan is back in town, and for your ease let me also share Mr. Rajan's mukuru details.

*Rajan Nayer*

Name: Rajan Nayer
Address: 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare
Contact Number: 0772460067
National ID Number: 63 1037566X00
2/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 71 400 8973: Thus wonderful. I will make the payment on Saturday, right now l am at work. It's the beginning of the year.
2/1/24, 1:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263714008973 Thank you for the update. Given the situation, I recommend considering Mukuru for making the payment. As you must be aware the original deadline was set for the 29th of December 2023. The university needs to maintain fairness to all students, and extending the deadline to Saturday could potentially reflect unfavorably on your scholarship application, please.
2/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Let me make the payment Tomorrow. With me here l do not have money
2/1/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update, sir. I have a scheduled meeting with the university officials this evening, and I'll take this opportunity to discuss the delay with them. I will inform them that your payment is expected by tomorrow. I trust that you will follow through on this commitment, sir, and I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.
2/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Normally l do not pay large sums of money in Harare. I will prefer to pay to Mr Rajan Nayer because l have seen where he stays
2/1/24, 2:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, please. I completely understand that. I shall wait for an update from your end. Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here.
2/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 350 8876: You said l must pay through Mukuru for mukuru it's tomorrow but for physical payment it's on Saturday to Mr Rajan
2/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's fine, sir. Please note that when you make a payment via Mukuru, you will receive a receipt in the form of text messages. You can then forward that receipt to us for the accounts team to keep a record about the same.
3/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Hi Jaison Amon, your Mukuru order #115775644 to R Nayer Pls pay USD447 within 48hrs with REF:115775644 at your nearest Mukuru Branch or Mukuru Orange Booth.
3/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Network problem. Waiting to deposit the money
3/1/24, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. However, as per the breakdown shared above the amount due for the second installment is $455. <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 3:57 PM - +263 77 350 8876: I can only pay $455 to Mr Rajan as cash because if we add $30+447 =$477-00. Because l can not have two charges for the same payment. If so l will pay on Saturday to Mr Rajan directly as cash
3/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 77 350 8876: I will pay $455-00 to Mr Rajan on Saturday. I have terminated the transaction.
I am going to pay the money on Saturday to Mr.Rajan
3/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 77 350 8876: $425-00 for the University and $30-00 is for Mr Rajan isn't it
3/1/24, 4:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct, and regarding you making the payment on Saturday let me connect with the team again as yesterday I was able to have a discussion with the university officials regarding the delay and informed them that you are going to make the deposit today. However, an extension again can impact the scholarship offer as well.
3/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Because you want Me Rajan to get his commission
3/1/24, 4:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773508876 I'd like to clarify a point for you. Mr. Rajan is not receiving any commission for his services. He's one of our associates who facilitates the transfer of your funds to India with a lower international transfer fee. If you were to use Mukuru for the payment, a 7% transfer fee would be applied by Mukuru itself. Should you prefer not to use Mr. Rajan's services or Mukuru, you always have the option of a bank transfer. Mr. Rajan's role is simply to ease the transaction process, especially considering that banks often have higher international transfer charges. It's important to understand that Mr. Rajan is not working for personal commission but to assist you in the payment process.
4/1/24, 9:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you earlier, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
5/1/24, 10:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting today as I was occupied with a meeting. Given that the day has been quite lengthy for me and we're at the end of our working hours, I suggest we resume our discussion at 08:30 am tomorrow. I'm hopeful you'll be available at that time. Wishing you a wonderful evening, and I eagerly await our conversation tomorrow.
6/1/24, 2:21 PM - +263 71 400 8973: Afternoon Kirti, l am at Mr Rajan now. He will come shortly
6/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 350 8876: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
6/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 71 400 8973: Thank. For the next step visa
6/1/24, 3:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation Monday.
