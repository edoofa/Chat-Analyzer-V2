26/12/23, 8:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Chidochashe!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Lovely Professional University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Lovely Professional University as a collective?
26/12/23, 8:20 PM - +263 77 979 9448: Good evening.we did and up to now we filled with excitement
26/12/23, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
26/12/23, 8:25 PM - +263 78 361 3423: Good evening.
We wanted clarity on whether the 700$ will be deducted from the $1375
26/12/23, 8:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. The $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
26/12/23, 8:37 PM - +263 78 361 3423: Yes it is clear now. Thank you
26/12/23, 8:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
26/12/23, 8:43 PM - +263 78 361 3423: We have no more questions at this stage
26/12/23, 8:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
26/12/23, 8:50 PM - +263 78 361 3423: Yes i did a research
26/12/23, 8:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
