18/12/23, 9:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tinevimbo.

I trust you're all in good health. I'm following up on our previous conversation, as the second deadline is drawing near. I'm reaching out to check on your preparations for this and to inquire about your plans, especially considering the upcoming festival season. Could you please let me know which date you have in mind to make the payment for the second deadline?
18/12/23, 9:38 PM - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you for getting in touch. Currently we are on holiday. I am not at home. I am actually marking the Examinations in Bulawayo (a city in Zimbabwe). 
As for the balance we already have it. The only challenge is getting in town to deposit. However we are going to try & make the deposit on the 23 of December. When I shall be back from marking.
18/12/23, 9:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with me, if you face any challenges I would like you to inform us about your challenges transparently so that we will be able to assist you. I look forward to getting an update from you. Have a blessed night.
18/12/23, 9:42 PM - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you for the reminder. We were actually distracted on the dates. We never accounted for the festive season holidays. Let us make some arrangements for payment. We shall come back to you soon.
18/12/23, 9:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
18/12/23, 9:52 PM - +263 77 391 1880: Thank you.
21/12/23, 2:05 PM - +263 77 391 1880: Good afternoon. Hope I find you well. 
I want to discuss on the issue of paying the balance. We have planned & intend to make the payment on Saturday the 23rd of December 2023.
However we *may* face a challenge if the Banks fail to as tomorrow 22 Dec is holiday. This may delay the payment up to the 27th since all the other remaining days fall on a weekend and Christmas holidays.
21/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 77 391 1880: However I do not foresee any further delay as our focus is on the 23rd of December.
May I take this opportunity to confirm Mr Charles Jerera's FBC account number. Do we still have to use the one which we used recently.

21/12/23, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, the slip is still not clear enough for the accounts team to go through them.
21/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 77 391 1880: Let me try to send some. I raised the issue with the bank & they said that is their best.

21/12/23, 5:17 PM - +263 77 391 1880: I requested the bank to give me clearer slips but, they insisted that these are the best they can produce.
21/12/23, 5:22 PM - +263 77 391 1880: I do not know what can be done to improve them.
May be I will ask Tinevimbo to try use her phone when I get home on Saturday or Sunday. It may produce better scans.
21/12/23, 8:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, however, we will require clearer slips, and you can share them with us tomorrow.
21/12/23, 8:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for the last part of your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
6/1/24, 6:49 AM - +263 77 391 1880: Good day to you. Hope I find you well. I need some enlightenment on the opportunities and operation requirements on the degree Tinevimbo chose ( B Sc Medical Laboratory Technology). Does it not require an operation license to fall under the medical fraternity. I am just curious.
6/1/24, 3:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Thank you for sharing your concerns I have taken a note of all your queries and I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation monday.
6/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 77 391 1880: That is alright with us. Thank you for getting in touch.
