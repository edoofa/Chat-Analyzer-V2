Given that the day has been quite lengthy for me and we're at the end of our working hours, I suggest we resume our discussion at 08:30 am tomorrow. I'm hopeful you'll be available at that time. Wishing you a wonderful evening, and I eagerly await our conversation tomorrow.

6/1/24, 8:41 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Isaac,

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $275 for your university registration fee is due before January 11, 2024. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations?

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $275 by now?
6/1/24, 8:46 AM - +265 997 17 19 93: I'll pay on Monday before due date
6/1/24, 8:59 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for keeping me posted, please inform me priorly regarding the invoice so that you do not face any challenges on Monday.
6/1/24, 9:38 AM - +265 997 17 19 93: Yes I'll inform you
6/1/24, 9:59 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I will be waiting for your response.
