My dad is a truck driver who always make sure that his family is well fed, clothed and educated. My mom is a qualified teacher but not yet employed and she also makes sure that we are always happy as a family. It is because of their love and teachings that l can call them my super heroes because they are  always there to protect us. They are also the ones that have been playing a role in shaping my education.

The admiration and respect you have for your parents are truly heartwarming. It's evident that they are not only your greatest inspiration but also your pillars of support. Your father's dedication, ensuring that his family’s needs are met, and your mother’s role as a teacher, reflect their commitment to your family's well-being and happiness.

5/1/24, 3:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/1/24, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.

5/1/24, 4:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/1/24, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Yes, l am.
5/1/24, 4:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/1/24, 4:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 372 3003: Yes, they are!
5/1/24, 4:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

5/1/24, 4:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

5/1/24, 5:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos.
5/1/24, 6:02 PM - +263 77 372 3003: After watching the videos, l understood that as students we must be teachable as well as open minded. As students we must be innovative that is to able to convert smaller ideas into bigger ideas so as to solve to be great leaders of tomorrow. Most importantly as students we must be able to follow instructions to be able to qualify for the prestigious institutions. Edoofa does not only get students affordable quality education and making them employable through SEELS program but rather it also increases students capacity of success by making us students more responsible and independent. Just John B Ervin l also his passion in engaging diverse group of people together and with the help Edoofa l can achieve this passion of mine because at Edoofa they have festives like holy whereby people show their love for one other through colours, and it is through such activities that as students we are able to help to help bring diverse groups of people together. As students we also have a statement of purpose where we have to express ourselves by sharing our achievements, abilities, unique traits etc so as to convince the admission board and any school of why we are worthy of the scholarship in a particular school
5/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
5/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
5/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
5/1/24, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
