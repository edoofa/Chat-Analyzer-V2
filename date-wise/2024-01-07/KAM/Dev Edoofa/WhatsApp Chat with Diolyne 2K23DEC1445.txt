3/1/24, 9:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Please let me know if you have taken a note of this.
3/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok
3/1/24, 9:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Coming back to the admission. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/1/24, 9:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes they are clear
3/1/24, 9:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 997 2192: I will fix it tomorrow morning
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: Noted!
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: please let me know if you are clear about these steps?
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes l am following
3/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes l am clear
3/1/24, 9:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/1/24, 9:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes they are clear as well
3/1/24, 9:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yed
3/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
3/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: Diolyne, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
3/1/24, 9:40 AM - +263 78 997 2192: The first video focuses on the qualities of successful students on Edoofa. It is important for students to understand the value of consistency and discipline, both of which are essential for success.
The second video explains the vision of Edoofa and the reason why they exist. Understanding the reason behind a platform can help students find their own vision and align it with the platform.
And the third video is focused on the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa platform. It's always important to know the  institutes that are on Edoofa. Knowing more about the schools and colleges can help students find the right fit for their academic and career goals.
I hope this helps clarify my understanding of these videos. Is there anything else you'd like to know about them?
3/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 78 997 2192: The first video focuses on the qualities of successful students on Edoofa. It is important for students to understand the value of consistency and discipline, both of which are essential for success.

3/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 997 2192: From my understanding, this video emphasizes the importance of taking the time to write a strong and compelling SOP. It also highlights the need to be authentic and genuine in the SOP, as schools want to get to know the real person behind the application. In addition, the video discusses the importance of editing and proofreading the SOP before submitting it.
3/1/24, 9:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Thank you for being sincere during the sessions.
3/1/24, 9:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
3/1/24, 9:57 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes

3. There are many different farming systems, but some common ones include conventional farming, organic.All of these farming systems are used in different parts of the world. Conventional farming is used in most parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Organic farming is also widely used, but it's most popular in Europe and North America. Regenerative farming is still in its early stages, but it's gaining popularity in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The choice of farming system depends on a variety of factors, including the climate, the soil type and availability of resources. The different farming systems have different uses, depending on the context. For example, conventional farming is often used to produce large quantities of food to meet the needs of a growing population. Organic farming is often used to meet the demand for food that is grown without synthetic chemicals. Regenerative 
farming is often used to improve soil health and increase resilience to climate change. 
4.Pesticides are chemicals that are used to control pests;including insects,weeds and fungi.There are many types for example Organophosphates used to control insects and also used in public health to kill mosquitoes.They can pose a risk to humans,they cause nausea,vomiting and diarrrhoea.Glyphosate is effective at killing weeds but it can harm beneficial insects such as bees.Fungicides which are used to control fungi that damages crops but it can cause harm to aquatic life.2,4-D, used to control weeds and can cause damage to liver and kidneys.
5.Okay, there are many other ways in which technology assist farmers examples  include is the use of smart irrigation systems, which use sensors and other technology to optimize water use and to reduce water waste. Another example is the use of autonomous tractors and other machinery, which can reduce labor costs and increase efficiency. There is also the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence to help farmers make more informed decisions about their operations.

4/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Soil fertility is the ability of soil to support plant growth. It's a complex and dynamic property of soil, and it's affected by many factors, including the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil. Some of the things that affect soil fertility include the amount of organic matter, the presence of nutrients, the structure of the soil, and the soil's pH. All of these factors work together to determine how well plants can grow in the soil. 
There are several ways to check soil fertility. One common method is to perform a soil test. A soil test can measure the soil's pH, nutrient levels, organic matter content, and other factors. Another method is to look at the soil's structure and texture, and to observe how well plants are growing in the soil. In addition, farmers and gardeners can keep track of crop yields to get an idea of soil fertility. Finally, there are also some more advanced methods, like using sensors to measure soil moisture and  There are many ways to improve soil fertility. One way is to add organic matter, like compost or manure. This can help improve the soil's structure, increase its nutrient content, and boost its ability to hold water. Another way is to use cover crops, which are plants that are grown to improve the soil. They can add nutrients and organic matter to the soil, and they can also prevent erosion and reduce weed growth. Additionally, farmers and gardeners can rotate their crops to avoid depleting the soil of nutrients.
4/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 997 2192: 3. There are many different farming systems, but some common ones include conventional farming,  organic farming, and regenerative farming. Conventional farming is the most common type of farming, and it typically involves the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Organic farming is a method of farming that uses natural, organic materials and avoids the use of synthetic chemicals. Regenerative farming is a relatively new approach that focuses on restoring and improving the health of the soil.
All of these farming systems are used in different parts of the world. Conventional farming is used in most parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Organic farming is also widely used, but it's most popular in Europe and North America. Regenerative farming is still in its early stages, but it's gaining popularity in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The choice of farming system depends on a variety of factors, including the climate, the soil type, and the availability of resources. 
 In Africa, most farming is still done using traditional, subsistence farming methods. This means that farmers rely on their own land and labor to produce food for themselves and their families. However, there is a growing trend towards more commercialized farming systems in some parts of Africa. For example, in South Africa, a large percentage of the country's agricultural production comes from commercial farms that use conventional farming methods. 
The different farming systems have different uses, depending on the context. For example, conventional farming is often used to produce large quantities of food to meet the needs of a growing population. Organic farming is often used to meet the demand for food that is grown without synthetic chemicals. Regenerative farming is often used to improve soil health and increase resilience to climate change. All of these farming systems can have positive and negative impacts on the environment, depending on how they are implemented.Aside from the three types I've already mentioned, there are several other farming systems used around the world. One example is biodynamic farming, which is based on the belief that plants and animals are connected to the cosmos. Another example is permaculture, which is a system of design that uses ecological principles to create self-sustaining ecosystems. There is also agroforestry, which is a method of farming that integrates trees with crops or livestock production.
4/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Pesticides are chemicals that are used to control pests, including insects, weeds, and fungi. They can be used on crops, livestock, and other areas where pests are a problem. There are different types of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. While pesticides can be effective at controlling pests, they can also have negative impacts on human health and the environment.  They can be used to protect crops from pests, to kill insects that carry disease, or to prevent the spread of weeds. Some pesticides are also used to control rodents, birds, or other animals. However, all pesticides have the potential to cause harm if they are used incorrectly. They can contaminate food, water, and soil, and they can also harm humans and animals.  Organophosphates are one of the most commonly used types of pesticides. They are used in agriculture to control insects, and they are also used in public health to kill mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects. Organophosphates are very effective at killing pests, but they also pose a risk to humans and animals. Exposure to organophosphates can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can also cause more serious problems, such as nervous system damage and cancer. One example is glyphosate, which is a widely used herbicide. It is effective at killing weeds, but it can also harm beneficial insects, such as bees. Another example is neonicotinoids, which are a type of insecticide that has been linked to the decline of bee populations. Finally, there are fungicides, which are used to control fungi that can damage crops. Fungicides can contaminate water sources and may also be harmful to aquatic life. Another example is atrazine, which is a herbicide that is commonly used in corn and other crops. Atrazine has been linked to reproductive problems in frogs, and it has also been found in drinking water. Another example is chlorpyrifos, which is a pesticide that is commonly used in agriculture. It has been linked to neurological problems in children, and it has been banned in some countries. Finally, there is 2,4-D, which is a herbicide that is used to control weeds in lawns and other areas. It can cause damage to the liver and kidneys,
4/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 997 2192: 5.Okay, there are many other ways in which technology can assist farmers,  One example is the use of smart irrigation systems, which use sensors and other technology to optimize water use and to reduce water waste. Another example is the use of autonomous tractors and other machinery, which can reduce labor costs and increase efficiency. There is also the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence to help farmers make more informed .There are  other several ways. One example is precision agriculture, which uses sensors and other technologies to monitor crop health and to make more efficient use of resources, such as water and fertilizer. Another example is biotechnology, which involves the use of genetically modified crops that are resistant to pests and diseases. This can reduce the need for pesticides. Finally, there is also the use of drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for tasks such as spraying pesticides. This can reduce the amount of pesticides that are used and can also make the process more efficient.

5/1/24, 8:34 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diolyne!
How are you all doing?
5/1/24, 8:37 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Morning l am doing good
5/1/24, 8:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that. So shall we move ahead with our session?
5/1/24, 8:39 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
5/1/24, 8:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great!
5/1/24, 8:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
5/1/24, 8:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
5/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes they are preparing they have been paying our school fees but they are in the process
5/1/24, 8:43 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok
5/1/24, 9:03 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
5/1/24, 9:04 AM - Dev Edoofa: In the meantime. Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Agriculture) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
5/1/24, 9:04 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok thank you
5/1/24, 9:05 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes it is accurate
5/1/24, 9:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
5/1/24, 9:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
5/1/24, 9:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
5/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes l am wondering about the details of this plan
5/1/24, 9:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you are eager to learn more about the details of this plan. I am going to brief it in the below points.
5/1/24, 9:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
5/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.
5/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
5/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok
5/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.
5/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
5/1/24, 9:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
5/1/24, 9:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
5/1/24, 9:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.
5/1/24, 9:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
5/1/24, 9:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
5/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 78 997 2192: We also wish to have this plan
5/1/24, 9:30 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
5/1/24, 9:33 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
5/1/24, 9:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
5/1/24, 9:38 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
5/1/24, 9:39 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
5/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
5/1/24, 9:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
5/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok
5/1/24, 9:41 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
5/1/24, 9:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
5/1/24, 9:43 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes l am seeing this perspective
5/1/24, 9:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
5/1/24, 9:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
5/1/24, 9:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
5/1/24, 9:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
5/1/24, 9:49 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
5/1/24, 9:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any addional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
5/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
5/1/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of 21-January-2024.
5/1/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
5/1/24, 10:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
5/1/24, 10:03 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
5/1/24, 10:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that. If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
5/1/24, 10:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
5/1/24, 10:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
5/1/24, 10:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
5/1/24, 10:12 AM - +263 78 997 2192: I think the Edoofa Management Secure plan is goodbit surely reduces burden on the parents
5/1/24, 10:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
5/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
5/1/24, 10:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
5/1/24, 10:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
5/1/24, 10:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
5/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok thank you for the information
5/1/24, 10:22 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Very interesting and good as well
5/1/24, 10:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
5/1/24, 10:34 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
5/1/24, 10:35 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
5/1/24, 10:36 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Tonight
5/1/24, 10:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on tomorrow to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
5/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok thank you
5/1/24, 10:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
6/1/24, 7:41 AM - +263 78 997 2192: They understood it and they want the plan but they said they will start paying by March right now their financial status is not stable
6/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Let's resume our session
