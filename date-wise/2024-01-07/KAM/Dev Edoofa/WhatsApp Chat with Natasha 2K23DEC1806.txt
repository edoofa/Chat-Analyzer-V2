27/12/23, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.
27/12/23, 1:26 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 1:27 PM - +27 73 481 2530: Yes
27/12/23, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 1:36 PM - +27 73 481 2530: Done
27/12/23, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 1:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 1:40 PM - +27 73 481 2530: Clear
27/12/23, 1:41 PM - +27 73 481 2530: Clear
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 1:43 PM - +27 73 481 2530: Noted
27/12/23, 1:44 PM - +27 73 481 2530: Yes
27/12/23, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 1:48 PM - +27 73 481 2530: Clear
27/12/23, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - +27 73 481 2530: All is clear
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 1:59 PM - +27 73 481 2530: Yes
27/12/23, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/12/23, 2:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/12/23, 2:07 PM - +27 73 481 2530: Yes
27/12/23, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

27/12/23, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform.

27/12/23, 2:08 PM - Dev Edoofa: Natasha, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.
27/12/23, 2:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
27/12/23, 2:28 PM - +27 73 481 2530: You can schedule next session for  tomro 13:00 hrs  again.
27/12/23, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1pm for our next session.

So, for the team to work on Natasha’s application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Natasha’s availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
28/12/23, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in Natasha’s admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

I can say that criminal law , the reason being criminal law deals with some of the most serious issues in our society such as violence and drug offensen.When one is charged it can have a huge impact on their life both physical and professionally 
Secondly ,criminal law is constanly evoloing ,as new laws are passed and new technologies are developed this means that criminal lawyer needs to be constantly learning   and adapting which makes the job exciting and challenging

5/1/24, 1:29 PM - Dev Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
5/1/24, 1:32 PM - +27 73 481 2530: Yes

5/1/24, 2:03 PM - +27 73 481 2530: We assumed 12.5% was for FBC Bank only...maybe thats what lead to errors.
6/1/24, 9:02 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Natasha and Parents!
I hope all of you are doing great.

Since we were not able to take forward our conversation yesterday, Shall we start with our session now?
6/1/24, 9:12 AM - +27 73 481 2530: Good day...we are fine.YES we can go ahead  now .Thank you
6/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Lets go ahead good mrng
6/1/24, 9:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that.
6/1/24, 9:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: We got in touch with our accounts team, and it came to our notice that $35 is remaining off of your enrollment fees. So, we would recommend you to complete this payment by 24th January. <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 9:15 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this date?
6/1/24, 9:17 AM - +27 73 481 2530: Noted ...Will do that .🙏
6/1/24, 9:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Shall we move ahead with our conversation?
6/1/24, 9:20 AM - +27 73 481 2530: Yes
6/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 77 923 6047: yes
6/1/24, 9:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: Let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
6/1/24, 9:31 AM - +27 73 481 2530: Yes we are confirming.Thats correct
6/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Yes thats correct
6/1/24, 9:32 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
6/1/24, 9:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
6/1/24, 9:33 AM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
6/1/24, 9:35 AM - +27 73 481 2530: Yes true
6/1/24, 9:37 AM - +27 73 481 2530: Yes ...we eager to know .
6/1/24, 9:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
6/1/24, 9:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
6/1/24, 9:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
6/1/24, 9:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
6/1/24, 9:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
6/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Its true its something that we wish to have
6/1/24, 9:45 AM - +27 73 481 2530: Noted thats amaizing Plan
6/1/24, 9:49 AM - +27 73 481 2530: Yes  absolutely
6/1/24, 9:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
6/1/24, 9:53 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Yes go ahead
6/1/24, 9:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
6/1/24, 9:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
6/1/24, 9:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
6/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Understood
6/1/24, 10:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
6/1/24, 10:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
6/1/24, 10:11 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
6/1/24, 10:12 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Ok its fine
6/1/24, 10:14 AM - +263 77 923 6047: But on the EWYL  program we are opening schools on Monday  so how am i going to partake in this because as u already know gutu high school is a boarding and cell phones are not allowed how are are going to continue with the program
6/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 923 6047: If it is possible can you please ask the headmaster to give us permission
6/1/24, 10:17 AM - +27 73 481 2530: Very clear..and understand
6/1/24, 10:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes Natasha, Thank you for informing and I completely understand this situation. Since you are not going to be able to attend the EWYL sessions, your parents can take part and convey you all the updates from these sessions.
I hope I was able to provide you with a viable solution?
6/1/24, 10:31 AM - +27 73 481 2530: Noted
6/1/24, 10:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now please let me know if we are together till here?
6/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 77 923 6047: We are together
6/1/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
6/1/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
6/1/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
6/1/24, 10:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
6/1/24, 11:01 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Its clear
6/1/24, 11:05 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
6/1/24, 11:07 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Explain
6/1/24, 11:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350.
6/1/24, 11:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
6/1/24, 11:14 AM - Dev Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
6/1/24, 11:15 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Yes
6/1/24, 11:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
6/1/24, 11:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
6/1/24, 11:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
6/1/24, 11:26 AM - Dev Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
6/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 77 923 6047: This is a great idea
6/1/24, 11:31 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Can u explain further here
6/1/24, 11:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Natasha. I want you to know that The Universities increase their eductaion fees in every few years. So, if there is an increment in the fees, you will still be entitled to pay according to the old fee structure.
6/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Ok  now i understand
6/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 77 923 6047: Can we please have another session tomorrow if possible just to cover up
6/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Natasha, since tomorrow is a Sunday, We will not be able to have a session. We can take forward our conversation on Monday. <This message was edited>
6/1/24, 12:00 PM - +263 77 923 6047: Its ok
6/1/24, 12:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: Great! We will have our session on Monday at 8:30 am. Have a wonderful day ahead.
6/1/24, 12:02 PM - +263 77 923 6047: Thanks same to you
