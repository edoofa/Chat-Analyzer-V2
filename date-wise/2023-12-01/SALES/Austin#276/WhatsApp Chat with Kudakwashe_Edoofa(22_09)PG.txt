22/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 872 7291: family background and professions of my parents goes like this


As from i know, my life has been a difficult as a student since day one. My parents have been trying by all means to help me achieve my education in this economic hardship environment in  our country Zimbabwe. They raised me up to Alevel which I completed in 2021. Through  endurance and hardworking i managed to pass both Alevel and Olevel with satisfactory grades. Then after my parents are failing to raise huge amounts of money to fund my Tertiary education as their small earnings cant even support me. The small which they get in hand through their hard work is being driven to help my siblings who are yet to complete basic education. I have four siblings who are still yet to finish primary education level. Therefore i can't  achieve the Tertiary education as i have no support from my family, thus why turned out looking for Edoofa scholarship.
My father is  a very small scale carpenter in  our locally area  and my mother is  just at home raising the family and busy on home chores. Therefore i believe through Edoofa i can make it to be part of the winning team and those who are going to make it in life and also help to transform my community and letting them know more about Edoofa if i get a scholarship
22/09/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 872 7291: i aspire to become an Engineer with quality skills for transformation of this world into a better place. basically i prefer to become an electrical/  chemical engineer or industrial engineer with Electrical as my 1st preference of choice

22/09/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 872 7291: it will be my greatest pleasure to be able to learn free through a 100 percent coverage so I can finish my educational studies, for up to now its have been 2 years without any advancement from my Alevel as i  have no funding. Im just at home, hoping and looking for a better future maybe a through scholarship like Edoofa 😣

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/09/23, 4:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 4:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The evaluations of our Academic Board and Universities will be based on
1. *Academics*
2. *Merit*
3. *Extra-Curricular Activities.*
4. *Statement of purpose.*
5. *Recommendation from Edoofa(Based on your activeness and performance in these sessions)* <This message was edited>
25/09/23, 4:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple terms, we reduce a student's education costs from *$8000 to nearly $3000 per year*, which includes their accommodation, food, and basic university expenses for the year, but *after this, we give students the opportunity to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
25/09/23, 4:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
25/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 872 7291: yeah it is very affordable compared to other countries out there
25/09/23, 4:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that, Kudakwashe,


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
25/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 872 7291: to which amount
25/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 872 7291: no but I just heard there learn while earn program
25/09/23, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you regarding this, Kudakwashe in the further session.
25/09/23, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
25/09/23, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
25/09/23, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
25/09/23, 4:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
25/09/23, 4:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
25/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 872 7291: ok
25/09/23, 4:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Webinars: -*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr. Simon Maingi
25/09/23, 4:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
25/09/23, 4:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
25/09/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 872 7291: as I wil be learning definitely i will befinit as i will also gain skill for other things like the mentioned on digital skills in marketing, AI and robotics too as i will be on my educational journey too and exposure from those who are currently in the same sector
25/09/23, 4:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed,


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.

25/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 872 7291: getting clearer

25/09/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 872 7291: ok i wil be there to follow up

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?

I hope that you are clear up to this point.
26/09/23, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
26/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 872 7291: 4 and 2
26/09/23, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! Kudakwashe
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposure and Higher Education Concierge.

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

26/09/23, 11:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
26/09/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 872 7291: my father if it's very affordable  as i said earlier she was the one who supported me mostly since day 1 as my mother isn't employed
26/09/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 872 7291: i see
26/09/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 872 7291: but to no shun away from the truth, right now he's earning little in this economical frustration in Zimbabwe, so he's just supporting the family with basic daily needs and affording school fees for my siblings behind me who are still  yet to reach Olevel
26/09/23, 11:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Kudakwashe, Thank you for sharing this with me
26/09/23, 11:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad? <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 872 7291: it will be a great pleasure to have someone who will be going getting  become a better person more than ever before
26/09/23, 11:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Kudakwashe, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents. <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 11:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
26/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 872 7291: yes it is
26/09/23, 11:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed Kudakwashe,


When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
26/09/23, 11:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
26/09/23, 11:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 11:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that it is clear and affordable to you so, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
26/09/23, 11:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule. 

Meanwhile you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

26/09/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 872 7291: explain a bit more here
26/09/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 872 7291: ok
26/09/23, 12:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for waiting. 

Are we good to continue?
26/09/23, 12:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Kudakwashe
26/09/23, 12:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
26/09/23, 12:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
26/09/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 872 7291: yes indeed
26/09/23, 12:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you are clear with process.
26/09/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 872 7291: better understanding now
26/09/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 872 7291: so you pay after getting accepted
26/09/23, 1:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Exactly, Kudakwashe.
26/09/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 872 7291: understood
26/09/23, 1:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 872 7291: i guess 1 and 2
26/09/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Kudakwashe,

We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 872 7291: yes
26/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 872 7291: understanding
26/09/23, 1:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Kudakwashe
26/09/23, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
26/09/23, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
26/09/23, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
26/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 872 7291: yes
26/09/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
26/09/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

She had an internship(attachment) with an Indian Company and is now pursuing a master's Program in India.

You can contact her and get to know more about the program. You can also request her to share with you her Offer Letter which she got from her Job

You can get in touch with them and learn about their experiences

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

27/09/23, 1:21 pm - Austin#276: In that case, the remaining costs are to be catered by the student's family
27/09/23, 1:22 pm - Austin#276: There are two options for Accommodation from which you are free to choose. 

1) Campus Accommodation- Students live in hostels inside the University premises.You are free to choose the type of hostel rooms and the seaters. There are single seaters, two seaters and more. 

2) Outside Campus-Accommodation is arranged in apartments outside the University campus.It is close to Universities and cheaper than in campus

27/09/23, 2:22 pm - Austin#276: Kudakwashe, does that mean you won't be working on the EWYL program to reduce your costs?
27/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 872 7291: i will  be hardly working, but as i see from other  whom Mr Pallika showed me, usually some failed to get  more than  100Us through EWYL program, how will that happen and how can the one cater for it if his or her family don't have money to cover the remaining fees
