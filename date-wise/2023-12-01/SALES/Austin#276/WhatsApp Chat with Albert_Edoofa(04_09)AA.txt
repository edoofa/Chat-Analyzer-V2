04/09/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
04/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes l am they range from about 2000-30000 per semester depending on the university and area of study
04/09/23, 2:06 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/09/23, 2:06 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 2:06 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
04/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Its still not affordable to my family maybe if l am eligible for75% -100% scholarship .
04/09/23, 2:13 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
04/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Am willing to work while studying so as to fund for my fees. 

 I dont know how its done if you can tell me if its possible
04/09/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
04/09/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
04/09/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/09/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/09/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
04/09/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

04/09/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
04/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 388 0728: How are you I am Mrs Mudhanda mother to Albert Takudzwa
04/09/23, 2:22 pm - Arshita: Greetings Mrs. mudhanda! 
I am doing well, thank you! 

How have you been?
04/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Very well much appreciated for the program and counseling session which I go through iam humbled
04/09/23, 2:25 pm - Arshita: Thank you so much! 

Have you gone through the session?
04/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Yes thank you so much for such a detailed session
04/09/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: You are welcome! 

Is Albert available to continue the session? Or we can continue with you?
04/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 581 9582: I think it is an opportunity to learn new things and how the industry operates in real life and be able to study it will only make it more interesting as you will  use the practical information from that you  have studied. It  is exciting challenge that am sure will test me and be able to bring out the best in myself so am very sure l will benefit a lot from it .
04/09/23, 2:29 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
04/09/23, 2:30 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Yes he is available
04/09/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
04/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes l can see and its so inspiring so motivational . Am sure EWYL program will be very useful and helpful in funding my fees during the learning course of my MBA. 
 I would love to undertake the program .
04/09/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
04/09/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
04/09/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
04/09/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
04/09/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
04/09/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
04/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 581 9582: I think 3 will be the standout for me why am l saying so , as for 1 ) yes  you might be guided to choose your career but without practical knowledge and effort of taking responsibility it will sure nothing.2) Some of the students can afford the fees through their parents thats taking away the responsibility part where the EWYL (3) mostly offers .  The fact that you are working to fund for your fees brings out determination not fail as you will know how hard earned money feels like. It brings out that level of responsibility in yourself to know how to manage and how a business or institution operates as for myself MBA  you will grab the knowledge of how to run a business on a practical level and be able to learn from that . It gives you exposure to the world outside so l will say 3 will be more interesting and beneficial from my point of view
04/09/23, 2:47 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

04/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes l have seen them .
04/09/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
04/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 581 9582: My mother will be helping
04/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Yes I will be there for him
04/09/23, 2:52 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with her after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
04/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay thank you  . 


 Am sure it will be one their proudest moments in their life
04/09/23, 2:54 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
04/09/23, 2:54 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
04/09/23, 2:54 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
04/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Am sure that will be all maybe with a student visa .
04/09/23, 2:59 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct
04/09/23, 2:59 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
04/09/23, 2:59 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
04/09/23, 2:59 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 2:59 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
04/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay you can
04/09/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
04/09/23, 3:04 pm - Arshita: However Albert, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay. Arent there Enrollments particularly starting this year not for 2024
04/09/23, 3:07 pm - Arshita: Sorry I didn't get you 

Can you please clarify?
04/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Am saying aren’t there places for me to start this year my MBA
04/09/23, 3:12 pm - Arshita: Albert, if your family is prepared for this year's intake, we can consider your application for the intake. 

For that we need to fastrack your application. You need to be very active throughout the process and eligibility check after which you will be receiving the results within a few days after which if you are found eligible we will guide you to join this intake.
04/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Am sure we are prepared for this intake  and we will be available .
04/09/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: That is well noted.
04/09/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 581 9582: I think we completed the first session only
04/09/23, 3:21 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
04/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay know l get it 

Yes you can
04/09/23, 3:24 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
04/09/23, 3:24 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
04/09/23, 3:24 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
04/09/23, 3:24 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
04/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes l totally understand.
04/09/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
04/09/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

05/09/23, 11:35 am - Austin#276: So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
05/09/23, 11:39 am - +263 78 581 9582: So we discussed about when to start my MBA , what it is all about and the EWYP program and how it works and also the  scholarship fees range that is from 50%-100% .
05/09/23, 11:42 am - Austin#276: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! So may I know if your family has any questions for me?
05/09/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 388 0728: Morning Austin
05/09/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 388 0728: Let me start by applauding for all this effort i really appreciate
05/09/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 581 9582: Sure  they didn’t clearly understand about the payment for registration fees . And how it has to be done to which university
05/09/23, 12:04 pm - Austin#276: Welcome to the session, Mrs Phionnah
I hope you are doing well
05/09/23, 12:04 pm - Austin#276: Thank you for your good words
05/09/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Very well thank you Austin nice having you
05/09/23, 12:06 pm - Austin#276: The registration fee($500-$750) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

As discussed earlier the cost of education ranges between $2000-$3000 which includes the registration fee too.
05/09/23, 12:06 pm - Austin#276: During the University sessions, you will receive offer letters from multiple universities and you will have the liberty to choose your university
05/09/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Thank you much appreciated
05/09/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay thank you sir for clarifying on that one . 

 Well understood and clear .
05/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay   Thank you
05/09/23, 12:46 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome!
05/09/23, 12:46 pm - Austin#276: Are you having other questions for me?
05/09/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 581 9582: As for now I dont have  any .
05/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Maybe in this year’s enrolment  am  l able to be enrolled in
05/09/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 388 0728: No other question from my side thank you for having you Austin my plea was to have 100 percent funding as I am a widow who wishes my kids to further their  studies.  Your assistance is greatly appreciated in advance.  Thank you Austin.  Anything please
05/09/23, 1:05 pm - Austin#276: I do understand the challenges, Mrs Phionnah
05/09/23, 1:05 pm - Austin#276: The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship. The scholarship and exact fees will be mentioned on your Offer letters from universities
05/09/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Well noted Austin
05/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Thank you for doing such a wonderful work to assist our students in our country please keep on doing the good work
05/09/23, 1:13 pm - Austin#276: You are most welcome!
05/09/23, 1:13 pm - Austin#276: So in the counselling session, we discussed the importance of Application forms, SOP, and then we have University Sessions, the Earn While You Learn Program, visa assistance, and all services for which the cost is cut down making the enrollment fee reduced to $350 which can be paid either in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining $150 in 30 days) or together
