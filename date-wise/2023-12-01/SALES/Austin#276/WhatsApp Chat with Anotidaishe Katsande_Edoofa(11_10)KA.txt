11/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 343 2431: Precisely
11/10/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 343 2431: That's a wide and prestigious and promising network and association
11/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 343 2431: I hope his current school, Tynwald High in Harare will also become part of this great network
11/10/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 343 2431: If its not already associated
11/10/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 343 2431: Now that he is still doing his lower 6, what are the processes involved in the meantime until he qualifies for university after U6?
11/10/23, 10:57 am - Kunal: Let me tell you that Tynwald High is already associated with the Edoofa program and we got the applications of the students after hosting  session with the parents in the group
11/10/23, 10:57 am - Kunal: I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your Son ahead for education. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 343 2431: My name is Farai Katsande. I am currently not in formal employment although I teach business courses/modules part time at the University of Zimbabwe in the Department of Education. I hold a Master of Commerce degree in Banking and Finance from the Midlands State University in Zimbabwe. I am a former banker for over 20 years since 1993 with vast experience in credit, loans administration finance. I am also a qualified microfinancer.
11/10/23, 11:14 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing your background and qualifications, Mr Farai. It's clear that you have a wealth of experience in the banking and finance industry, with over two decades of service in various roles. Your academic achievements, including a Master of Commerce degree in Banking and Finance, are impressive.
11/10/23, 11:14 am - Kunal: Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?

You can also highlight the career aspirations and academic Background
11/10/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 343 2431: I believe that quality education will open vast opportunities for him globally basing on the potential that I see in him.
11/10/23, 11:15 am - Kunal: I am glad that you have a good vision for the career of your child and I believe it would come true if he is found eligible for the program
11/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 343 2431: I see him as a very competent student who applies himself to his work and is determined to achieve his goals. As a person, he is very sociable, well behaved and a natural leader. He has occupied leadership positions since his  primary schooling including being Headboy and currently appointed prefect.

The weakness that I see in him is maybe wanting to over-apply himself resulting at times in his failure to settle for a single choice in his career aspirations where he needs more guidance.

His career aspirations are in business administration although he is also interested in commercial law.

He has quite a sound academic background with 8 'O' level Cambridge passes
11/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 343 2431: He is quite assertive in what he wants to achieve and he believes in his abilities
11/10/23, 11:38 am - Kunal: You have provided valuable insights into Joshua's character and aspirations. It's clear that he is a highly competent student who consistently dedicates himself to his work and is resolute in achieving his goals. His sociable nature, good behavior, and natural leadership qualities are commendable, and his history of holding leadership positions, such as being Headboy and currently a prefect, reflects his leadership potential.

May I know if he is currently in Upper 6?
11/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 343 2431: He is Anotidaishe just to correct the name
11/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 343 2431: He is currently in lower 6
11/10/23, 11:55 am - Kunal: Excuse me for the error
11/10/23, 11:55 am - Kunal: Noted
May I know, how much is his per term fee in A level in USD and who has been supporting him so far for education?
11/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 343 2431: It's $1,365.00
I have been paying for him all along but because of my current situation his school fees are in arrears.
11/10/23, 12:01 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
So, may I know what fascinated him about pursuing a course and career in Business?
11/10/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 343 2431: I am sure he got inspiration first from his mother who teaches accounting and commerce at secondary school level and she likes doing the small businesses like selling in her free time.  I also believe he got to observe something(s) he liked about the commercial world in general when I was still in banking and he liked the idea of being in the commercial set up of things. His involvement in school commercial clubs also added to this passion. So he then developed the idea of wanting to even set up his own business enterprise in the future. So he is driven mostly by that long term goal.
11/10/23, 12:32 pm - Kunal: It's wonderful to hear about the sources of inspiration that have contributed to Anotidaishe's career aspirations. It's evident that his mother's involvement in teaching accounting and commerce, as well as her engagement in small businesses, has likely had a significant influence on his interests.

So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me his previous qualification results i.e subjects of A level and O level results, please?
A picture would be better
11/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 343 2431: In a moment please
11/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: Alright please
In the meantime, may I know his subjects of A level?
11/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 343 2431: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 343 2431: Accounting 
Business 
History
11/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing them. 
I would also like to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough for resources and study materials, due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting. Therefore, after the evaluations, the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about him achieving it
11/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 343 2431: Thank you. I am sure he will surpass the minimum requirement
11/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Based on my evaluation, considering his subjects and interests, he is eligible for

*Bachelor of Business Administration*

12/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 343 2431: I am sure that studying in India will positively impact his career for a number of reasons;
1) the thorough training in business guided by experts and encouraged by luminaries who have gone through the same Indian mill  will develop him into a well grounded learning business executive  able to function in industry.

2. Cultural diversity is critical for any young person to develop both emotionally,  intellectually and even professionally by cross-pollinating ideas and experiences. This will be very critical for both his short to medium term professional goals and ambitions as an executive, as well as his long term goal of being an entrepreneur. The recognition of Indian qualifications will open doors to him globally for diverse experiences 

3. Research, innovation and critical thinking coupled with mentoring and nurturing are also critical for his development not only into a young but commanding exevutive able to function at any corporate level, but also for his long term entrepreneurship vision. The well decorated business moguls who are Indian are key for his motivation.

So I believe that studying in India is a perfect match for his ambitions.

12/10/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 343 2431: Given that it is paid in two instalments, I feel its affordable.
12/10/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 343 2431: It is fine me
Thank you
12/10/23, 1:13 pm - Kunal: Good afternoon
Shall we proceed?
12/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 343 2431: Afternoon 
Yes please we may proceed
12/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
12/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 343 2431: That is a great one. I would be happy to get full details of how the student accrues the credits
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: *Webinars: -*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
12/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 343 2431: In my view the EWYL program has much more than financial gain. The innovation, critical thinking and solving challenges on your feet as it were is exactly what today's student requires to meet the ever-growing challenges brought about by changes in technology, climate, markets and regulatory environment among others. It will certainly benefit my son on more than one front
12/10/23, 1:45 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
12/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 343 2431: Excellent! It's along the lines of self financing. I like it. Of course with the student remaining focused on the central objective of study, which I do not doubt he will do.
12/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: That is right, Mr Farai
However, I'd like to emphasize that the "Earn While You Learn" program, offered by Edoofa, is designed to strike a balance between work and study,
12/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 343 2431: That's great. I
12/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kunal: Indeed
Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
12/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
12/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
12/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
12/10/23, 1:54 pm - Kunal: After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
12/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 343 2431: It's the most difficult question you have asked since we started yesterday!
Honestly the four points carry equal amount of weight in my view. They at inseparable in the provision of the kind of service that Edoofa provides. I can't pick any one ahead of the others
12/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 343 2431: I am sorry I totally like them all
12/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn

12/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Anotidaishe with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
12/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 343 2431: I and my wife who is a teacher will be doing meeting the difference
12/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
12/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 343 2431: I cannot wait to have him secure a place and study abroad to enjoy the quality, environment, mentoring and nurturing and more. I am thrilled by the idea
12/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make  career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
12/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
12/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 343 2431: In addition;
4) Prior qualification ('O' and 'A' level) results
5) Police clearances
12/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
12/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
12/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 343 2431: 👏👏👏
Great vision
12/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
12/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 343 2431: This a commendable arrangement that eases the pressure. Thank you.
12/10/23, 2:46 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 343 2431: I think stages 1 and 2
12/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 343 2431: Yes please
12/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
12/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
12/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 343 2431: Yes please it's clear
12/10/23, 3:01 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
12/10/23, 3:01 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

13/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 343 2431: 1. My son is doing lower 6 which means he qualifies for 2025 admission, is it?
13/10/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 343 2431: Does Edoofa consider Cambridge AS results?
13/10/23, 9:39 am - Kunal: That is right, Mr Farai
13/10/23, 9:40 am - Kunal: Yes, Edoofa program considers Cambridge AS results
13/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 343 2431: Does Edoofa consider sports scholarship or are there any plans to consider same?
13/10/23, 9:53 am - Kunal: The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship

Please not that sports would be considered under extracurriculars and exemplary performance willl definitely be considered for the scholarship evaluation
13/10/23, 9:53 am - Kunal: Does your child have sports achievements or certificates?
13/10/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 343 2431: Thank you

13/10/23, 10:09 am - Kunal: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
13/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 343 2431: Apologies. Network is quite poor this morning we do not have power(electricity)
13/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 343 2431: We believe the set fees are very reasonable and we are prepared to meet the costs especially given the further relaxation of the payment conditions we will do everything in our power to pay.
13/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 343 2431: The cost of education is affordable in our view also considering the quality of education provided and that there is the EWYL program then that makes it even more affordable
13/10/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: That is well-noted
Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents/guardians of our applicants. Your role in their higher education is significant, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

Along with moral support, financial support is also a significant factor in higher education. We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. If found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?.

13/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 343 2431: Done
13/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kunal: Your acknowledgement is well noted
As you know, form 6 students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests.
13/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kunal: All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Anotidaishe?*
13/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 343 2431: Thank you very much
13/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 343 2431: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 343 2431: However, we may proceed
13/10/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: I appreciate your willingness to participate in your child’s career!
Can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will he/she be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

Due to this opportunity Anotidaishe is considering writing his final examinations in June next year since he is currently writing his AS Cambridge exams.   He wanted to know, as well as we do as parents, whether it will be possible for him to be slotted into the 2024/2025 intake instead of 2025/2026 since he will be done with his Cambridge "A" level in full before the first semester starts?

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about an important matter regarding your child's application.

As you are aware, your child's application was provisionally reserved, allowing some extra time for the complete enrollment fee of $169. However, since you are close to the payment deadline date. You must understand that honoring the deadline is of utmost importance

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about an important matter regarding your child's application.

As you are aware, your child's application was provisionally reserved, allowing some extra time for the complete enrollment fee of $150. However, it’s been a while since you missed the payment deadline date. It's crucial that you understand that honouring the deadline is of utmost importance and when not done it comes with some consequences, like:

Your child will miss out on several benefits, including Visa Assistance and Financial Planning.

Admission to a higher scholarship may become challenging, as universities often review recommendations from Edoofa and student applications for adherence to deadlines.

Your child's reserved seat will be released, and a penalty of $500 will be incurred if reapplication is necessary.

Your child's admission process will be delayed.

I want to assure you that as your counsellor, I am empathetic and have always provided the best career advice. I understand that you might be facing challenges, which is why you couldn’t make the payment. Therefore, I would encourage you to open up and have a conversation with us about the same so that we can guide you accordingly.
