30/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

And would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
30/11/23, 5:52 pm - +260 762344394: Definitely!!
30/11/23, 6:02 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
30/11/23, 6:04 pm - +260 762344394: When say financially. In wat ways would they help me financially.
30/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: Mapalo, firstly, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
30/11/23, 6:10 pm - +260 762344394: Oh I understand But does your edoofa scholarship program offer scholarships in aviation.
30/11/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we do offer scholarships.
30/11/23, 6:17 pm - +260 762344394: Ah perfect am really loving this.
30/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So now are you clear that you would require financial support, Mapalo?
30/11/23, 6:18 pm - +260 762344394: Yes I am.
30/11/23, 6:19 pm - +260 762344394: But how possible is it to acquire a hundred percent scholarship in aviation
30/11/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: While I would brief you about the same, may I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship, Mapalo?
30/11/23, 6:24 pm - +260 762344394: According to wat u said. I think a 100% scholarship would mean that all tuition fees would be covered except for accommodation and feeding. Am I correct?
30/11/23, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: Correct!

I am glad you are thoroughly following.
30/11/23, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: So now may I know if your parents are willing to support you financially for your higher education in India, Mapalo?
30/11/23, 6:27 pm - +260 762344394: This message was deleted
30/11/23, 6:29 pm - +260 762344394: Can I give u feedback on that question after I seat down with them after they knock off from work.
30/11/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: Surely, Mapalo
30/11/23, 6:30 pm - +260 762344394: Grt, Most likely after an hour.
30/11/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Mapalo!
30/11/23, 6:31 pm - +260 762344394: No problem.
30/11/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
