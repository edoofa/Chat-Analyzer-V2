22/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 119 0510: From little understanding, Edoofa is an international scholarship program that support students to learn abroad, and help them to parsue with their dreams and ambitions in academics, and l learnt a lot of things from rumbidzai, such like, when you got an opportunity to learn with Edoofa, the burden of fees and other other things will be taken care off with Edoofa, and l also learnt that it will be easy for me to have a  occupation after accomplishing my studies with Edoofa, for it will help there there students to have possitions in areas of specialization,. This what makes me interested to apply for the scholarship
22/11/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Tinashe, so, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/11/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

23/11/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Alright,

23/11/23, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

24/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
24/11/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 119 0510: Yes we can
24/11/23, 9:23 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared document, Tinashe?
24/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 119 0510: Still downloading network was the challenge yesterday

24/11/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: Alright, I shall expect to hear from you.
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Ok
24/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Now l am done with the document
24/11/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
24/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Edoofa is therefore to provide afodability for higher and quality education to deserving students, in various prestigious universities in India, apart from afodability, Edoofa is also therefore to provide employability to the Edoofa learning students. It provides internship to the learning students, thereby giving students opportunities of earning while learning, this as result helps students to the chances of credibility and it is a chance of reducing their fees loans. By doing so, it creates a strong hard working   and well experience with high quality level of knowledge.
24/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you earlier, so now I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
25/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 119 0510: In terms of financial aspects, it is a well designed program, which is helpful for deserving students, for it provides a room to allow students to have loans and at the same time providing internships to students as a way of depreciating their debt balance. Bt it is a bit complex to those who are less previladge or those who didn't manage to get a sponsor for the scholarships process execution. And to those who didn't manage to get a 100% scholarship. I understand it is also good to the organisation, for it is also a sicial profit organization. Yaar that's my understanding
27/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 119 0510: Ok
27/11/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Hello Everyone,

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
27/11/23, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
27/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Apologies for time miss out
28/11/23, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Apologies for late response
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 119 0510: We can
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So did you understand the following too?
28/11/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Ok l understand
28/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 119 0510: So l must supposed to take care of0$3000 for myself that's what you mean
28/11/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: What did you understand from the same please?
28/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 119 0510: My understanding is, the scholarship will take of 62.5% of the university expenses per year and the student will  care of the remaining 37.5% of the expenses. And if l approved to be doing well in  evaluation, there gonna be a further reduction in of the fee or get an opportunity of earning while learning so that l can be able to take care of the remaining fee balance, that is my understanding from above script.
28/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Tinashe.
28/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: So did you discuss the same with your parents too?
28/11/23, 9:01 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Thursday at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
