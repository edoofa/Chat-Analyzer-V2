You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

27/11/23, 2:05 pm - +27 63 264 7499: Flight costs = $ payable by scholarship or parent

27/11/23, 2:09 pm - +27 63 264 7499: Food related costs .
27/11/23, 2:09 pm - +27 63 264 7499: Registration fees
27/11/23, 2:11 pm - +27 63 264 7499: If the above is clarified then l see what l am obliged to offer as being within the range of my wages or not .
27/11/23, 2:12 pm - +27 63 264 7499: And lastly Health related costs. Medication, ambulance or so
27/11/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
27/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Firstly, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
27/11/23, 2:16 pm - +27 63 264 7499: I now understand.
27/11/23, 2:18 pm - +27 63 264 7499: I also wanted to know if your scholarship is confined to Universities only . Or a student can apply at any university and still get assistance
27/11/23, 2:22 pm - +27 63 264 7499: What makes us seek scholarship is that our coffers as a family are a bit limited. to afford tuition at local universities in Zim. 

Then that l am supposed to pay might ( compounded) be found even higher than local costs which l would have failed to afford.
27/11/23, 2:25 pm - +27 63 264 7499: For example one Zim university might require US $700 per semester. I fail to raise that . Then a scholarship requires me to pay US $900 plus other related costs
27/11/23, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Mr Stanley.

I would like to share a document with you for your better understanding.

Kindly go through the same and inform me once done.
27/11/23, 2:33 pm - +27 63 264 7499: It's ok Ma'am
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Mr Stanley
