So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
20/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 212 5648: Actually...this program helps in promoting great tertiary education in India. Moreso the scholarship will help in provision of Visas. I don't know much but there's also consideration of the student's result .. before chosing a  specific program
20/11/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Daniel, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/11/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
20/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 212 5648: This is great news..lm glad to be part of the program..

20/11/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed, Daniel, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

20/11/23, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: Well Daniel now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

20/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 212 5648: In my opinion I think it's a change of lifeline...l really want to change the storyline and background of my family. So l think it's another opportunity to get to quality education and also better employement
20/11/23, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: Well received Daniel!

20/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 212 5648: Yes lm ready mentally well prepared
20/11/23, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

20/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 212 5648: Mentally the family is willing but financially they are not ready...as they say ... they are ready to give their best they can...for my education
20/11/23, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand the same, Daniel.

May I know how are you planning your higher education in India from a financial aspect?
20/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 212 5648: Financially...l have to know the demands for me to give a conclusion on that Ms
20/11/23, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: I can understand, 

However didn't you happen to discuss regarding the financial support with your parents please?
20/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 71 212 5648: As l said they are arranging....and try to give their best... maybe a budget of $500 fees to study
20/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: I understand
20/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Daniel, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
20/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 71 212 5648: Yes totally agree
20/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: So Considering the financial requirements to study even in Zimbabwe, may I know how are your parents planning for your higher education please?
20/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 71 212 5648: In what terms Ms ..please be more clear
20/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Financial aspect please, Daniel.
20/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 71 212 5648: Financially they will provide
20/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
