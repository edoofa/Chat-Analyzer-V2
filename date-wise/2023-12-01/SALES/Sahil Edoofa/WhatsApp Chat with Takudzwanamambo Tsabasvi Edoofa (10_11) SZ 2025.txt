On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
16/11/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 734 4102: Hello ...yes I am ready
16/11/23, 12:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Takudzwanamambo!
16/11/23, 12:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes I am confident about that
16/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 734 4102: I was  in a new set-up and I have not been attending extra-lessons which I  already started doing from last holiday and I am  still doing and I'm committed to doing

16/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
16/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Well I want to be a pharmacist inspired by my father ......I want to. Open my own pharmacy in Zimbabwe and serve others as per my duties as a pharmacist
16/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Thank you

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
16/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 734 4102: I had more interests in biology .....that is the reason why I didn't pursue physics
16/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 734 4102: In Zimbabwe we have to have 3 subjects at A level
16/11/23, 5:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takudzwanamambo, the minimum threshold that you need to fulfil in order to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Pharmacy is Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in your A-Level respectively.

16/11/23, 5:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takudzwanamambo. The deciding subject is Physics, please.
16/11/23, 5:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, BSc Chemistry and Bachelor in Pharmacy (BPharma) are closely related academic programs, both revolving around the study of chemicals and their applications.

17/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 734 4102: I have general knowledge about India and its education system but my  knowledge is not completely up to date. India is the world's second most populous country, and its education system is quite large and diverse. It is composed of elementary school, secondary school, and higher education, and there is also a large private tutoring sector. In recent years, the Indian government has made efforts to improve the quality of education and increase access to education for all.

17/11/23, 4:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that India's contributions to the field of chemistry have left an indelible mark on the global stage. With a rich history dating back to ancient times, India has been a cradle of chemical knowledge, producing pioneers like C.V. Raman and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Nobel laureates who advanced our understanding of the physical and structural aspects of chemistry. India's vibrant pharmaceutical industry is another testament to its chemistry prowess, consistently supplying affordable and high-quality medicines to the world. Moreover, Indian scientists and researchers continue to push boundaries, making strides in green chemistry, sustainable practices, and innovative drug discovery. India's chemistry community is celebrated for its dedication to scientific exploration, innovation, and a brighter, more sustainable future for all!

17/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Okay I will
17/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the interview, please?
17/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 734 4102: I haven't finished going through the texts sent
17/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Takudzwanamambo. I will be waiting for your response.
17/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 734 4102: I have finished going through the texts
17/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Studying in India can help me with research and innovation opportunities......it can help me on having variety of jobs across the nations and I am looking forward to be one of the students that are successful from Indian universities
17/11/23, 8:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
17/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Well I have to be truthful I am not really sure about that
17/11/23, 8:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Takudzwanamambo! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
17/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
17/11/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Will let you know in a short while after hearing their response
17/11/23, 9:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Takudzwanamambo. I will be waiting for your response.
17/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Okay sir will let you know
17/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Unfortunately they are both offline so I will let you know first thing in the morning
17/11/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Takudzwanamambo. However, we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.
17/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Okay sir thank you....I'm not the only child in my family so if the costs are too high for my family I will let you know
17/11/23, 9:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
17/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Not really.... would love to know about it
17/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takudzwanamambo. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
17/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
17/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
17/11/23, 9:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
17/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes this will be beneficial for me ...for I will learn a lot about the industry and marketing and be better before I'm set into the business
17/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
17/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
17/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
17/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

17/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
17/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes I have
17/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 734 4102: I have spoken to my mother and she said they will be able to afford the money in a year
17/11/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 734 4102: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 9:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is good to know, Takudzwanamambo. May I know whether you think it is affordable now?
17/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes it is affordable
17/11/23, 9:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
17/11/23, 9:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
17/11/23, 9:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
17/11/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 734 4102: I appreciate every point listed ....but the point I appreciate the most is point 4
17/11/23, 10:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Takudzwanamambo! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
17/11/23, 10:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
17/11/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 734 4102: They are very encouraging about it
17/11/23, 10:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
17/11/23, 10:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
17/11/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes it is indeed true
17/11/23, 10:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
17/11/23, 10:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
17/11/23, 10:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 10:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
18/11/23, 9:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/11/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 734 4102: I have understood sir
18/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
18/11/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Edoofa helps a student arrange his or her  finances by using the earn while you learn programme where the students get to work and and learn simultaneously
And on the financial aspect. Edoofa helps reducing the fees from a range of 2000 to 3000 <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 9:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
18/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Thank you sir ...well understood
18/11/23, 9:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 734 4102: So far we have covered:01personalized counseling session
02 eligibility check tests and interview 
And we are in stage 2
18/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
18/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes please go on
18/11/23, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
18/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes I have clearly understood
18/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

20/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Mr.Shashwat* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
20/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes I am ready
20/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Sorry for being late I had an exam on a short notice
20/11/23, 3:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Mr. Shashwat go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by him during the session?
20/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes they were ....the session was okay
20/11/23, 5:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
20/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes .....I really appreciate the work she put in for her children and I'm looking forward for my parents to have the same support from edoofa
20/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 734 4102: My mother also spoke to her <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 6:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
20/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 734 4102: 1: bachelor of science in chemistry
2: India
3:ranges from $6000-$8000 <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 734 4102: This message was deleted
20/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 734 4102: 4: annual fee ranges from $2000-$3000
5: enrolment fee is $350 
6:the first payment is to be made within a range of 7 days or $200 is first paid in 7 days then the remaining in 30 days
20/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 734 4102: 7: Affirmative ma'am <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 7:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
20/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes ,my parents are ready for it
20/11/23, 7:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/11/23, 7:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
20/11/23, 7:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 7:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
20/11/23, 7:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 7:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 25 th or 26 th November 2023 for $200 and the 25 th or 26 th of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 25 th or 26 th of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
20/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 276 6625: We would opt for number one.

I have been so happy, as well excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage👏🏽👏🏽. 

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email , and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
23/11/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 7:06 am - +263 77 276 6625: Thank you very much for the acceptance letter.
We are very grateful for your guidance up to this stage so far - and we hope work together and we pledge our cooperation to make it a success and grow the Edoofa brand. 

Thank you very much.
24/11/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 734 4102: Thank you very much sir I am very much excited to be part of the edoofa scholarship programme .......and I'm looking forward to it
24/11/23, 12:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
24/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 734 4102: I'm doing fine thank you
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through the student's acceptance letter and did you manage to discuss it as a family?
24/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 734 4102: Yes I did go through the acceptance letter together with my father .....and he is agreeing to it
He says we will go by the option where we first pay $200
24/11/23, 8:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
24/11/23, 8:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-
