18/10/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak created group "Mbongeni_Edoofa(18/10)HP"
19/10/23, 9:09 am - You joined using this group's invite link
19/10/23, 9:17 am - Harmehak: Mbongeni as you mentioned plum tree town, are you aware that Edoofa is associated with Plumtree high school as well?
19/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 493 4717: No ma'am I wasn't aware
19/10/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: I hope it must be exciting to know the same now?
19/10/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 493 4717: Yes because plumtree town is my home and as the  Edoofa program enrolls many children from there they actually have a better chance to a better life
19/10/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Mbongeni.

We have students who would be coming to India from Plumtree town and Plumtree high school in August 2023.

19/10/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Well Mbongeni now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
19/10/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 493 4717: On my point of view I see it as a life changing opportunity because acquiring higher education in india  at a lower cost is big advantage as Tinotenda mentioned to me that practical work is offered it is helpful for more experience in the field so yes. 

After the course or field u would be doing I believe in india there will be plenty of companies opening their doors for you  because of your learning experience and your academical accomplishments.
19/10/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that from you, Mbongeni.

In that case, would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
19/10/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 493 4717: Mentally prepared yes ma'am I'm ready to face any obstacle that may come my way
19/10/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
19/10/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 493 4717: Certainly my family members are aware of my plans of studying abroad as they too believe it is a step in the right direction and I am sure that they are more than willing to support me in any thing pertaining to my higher education abroad mentally .

Financial I'm sure whatever needs necessary for me to attain my goal of being an engineer they will support with no questions asked .

19/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 493 4717: 2022 ma'am
19/10/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, and are you pursuing a one year diploma, Mbongeni?
19/10/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 493 4717: No ma'am its a 4 year diploma for now I'm in the national certificate stage
19/10/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: In that case, how are you planning your education in India from next year itself, Mbongeni?
19/10/23, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Mbongeni, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 78 493 4717: Yes it means no  multiple payments one payment across all those  means no more stresses
19/10/23, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: Very correct please
19/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 493 4717: Thank you ma'am
19/10/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/10/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 493 4717: Well understood ma'am
19/10/23, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
19/10/23, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
19/10/23, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/10/23, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 493 4717: Yes ma'am now have a clear picture thank you
19/10/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/10/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$750) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
19/10/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

19/10/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
19/10/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

19/10/23, 5:51 pm - +263 78 493 4717: Great ma'am
19/10/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
19/10/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
19/10/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

19/10/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.

20/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 493 4717: Yes sir we have had a chance to communicate with Mrs Ruth and she has made it clear to us that if it wasn't for the Edoofa program they wouldn't have made this far and hand in hand with the EWYL program assisting in paying the fees
20/10/23, 2:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
20/10/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So far doyou have any questions for me ?

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!

20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

21/10/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 276 4104: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 1:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
21/10/23, 1:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
21/10/23, 1:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 1:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
21/10/23, 1:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 1:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th October 2023 for $200 and the 26th or 27th  of November for the remaining $150.

26/10/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 493 4717: Yes sir thank you
26/10/23, 11:23 am - Sahil Edoofa: So do you have any questions for me ?
26/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 493 4717: No sir well understood
26/10/23, 11:31 am - Sahil Edoofa: So do you want me to guide you about the available payment modes in depth ?
26/10/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 493 4717: Yes sir thank you
26/10/23, 12:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe
26/10/23, 12:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
