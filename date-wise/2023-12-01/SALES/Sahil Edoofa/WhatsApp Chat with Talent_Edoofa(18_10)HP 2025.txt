19/10/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
19/10/23, 9:44 am - Harmehak: However we always encourage our students to aim for better results.
19/10/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 397 9405: Iam grateful that the government is taking steps to make the Edoofa scholarship more accessible to students like me. This is a great opportunity.

25/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 397 9405: EWYL  is a program is the backbone of Edoofa in which students are given real time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits based on a student's performance that is equivalent to physical cash. However the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

I hope your weekend provided you with the opportunity to rejuvenate. Are you ready to continue our session for today?
06/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 397 9405: It's great to chat with you again. Im looking forward to  our conversation.
06/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Noted.
06/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zambia, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zambia is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zambia, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zambia has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zambian families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
06/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 12:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th November 2023 for $200 and the 11th or 12th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
06/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 397 9405: Thank you for the detailed information on the application deadlines and financial commitments.  I can see that Edoofa is very serious about ensuring it's students and prepared to take advantage of the program and succeed . I appreciate the transparency around the requirements 🙏
06/11/23, 12:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
06/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 71 397 9405: The first one .
I'd be happy to provide any financial information you require to ensure that my child is eligible for the program and I'm promising you that im getting started preparing bearing in mind that 1 year left for my child to finish A level.

19/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 71 397 9405: Thanks for the congratulations ! I'm honoured to be selected for this prestigious scholarship.  Im truly happy for myself😊
20/11/23, 12:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Afternoon, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 71 397 9405: Yes sir sorry for late reply
20/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 397 9405: I was at school and I didn't find time to be active on WhatsApp
20/11/23, 5:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you go through the acceptance letter ?
20/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 397 9405: Yes sir.
20/11/23, 5:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
20/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 71 397 9405: Yes sir
20/11/23, 6:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
20/11/23, 6:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
