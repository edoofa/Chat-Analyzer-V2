03/10/23, 11:06 am - Harmehak: Your kind words are appreciated please.
03/10/23, 11:06 am - Harmehak: So may I know what exactly does she wish to pursue for her higher education in India?
03/10/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 240 7949: The first choice was pharmacy but could not qualify because of her O'level qualifications,,and now it will be social science
03/10/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: I can understand, however can you please share if she wishes to study Social work under social sciences?
03/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 240 7949: Sorry it is supposed to be social work
03/10/23, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Alright please.
03/10/23, 11:21 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
03/10/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 240 7949: So it's to our advantage as I really understand that she is going to get these points ,and most likely to be enrolled in India
03/10/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: I can understand and that's wonderful!
03/10/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: @263772407949 are you as parents prepared to support Phelistas's higher education in India mentally and financially please?
03/10/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 240 7949: The way I am replying and continuously on line with you that shows my great interest in India
03/10/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: That's great please!
03/10/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Now lets discuss Phelistas's desired field!
03/10/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
03/10/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
03/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 240 7949: Great work you have done ,that's a detailed career guidance,which  I have to consider
03/10/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to hear that!

Let me provide you the detailed description as well.
03/10/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society.

04/10/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
04/10/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 240 7949: As I have  been reading and listening to the current affairs  ,I them understand that India has become one of the fast going nation in the whole world.If I am not wrong it's now ranging to number 2, or 3 fast ecomonic giant  of the world with it's pharmacitical,medical and film industry.So the saying goes

04/10/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: That's very well put across please!

I appreciate your thorough awareness.
04/10/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

04/10/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 240 7949: I have learned ,and  and added a lot of knowledge in my mind ,now India is in my right palm
04/10/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, please 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
04/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 240 7949: No my worship
04/10/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
04/10/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/10/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/10/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/10/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 240 7949: May my God with due respect allow me or grant me an opportunity to be of you in the mighty name amen
04/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 240 7949: to be part
04/10/23, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

Isn't that exciting?
04/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 240 7949: There is nothing good in this world than this method, very beautiful idea
04/10/23, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Lets discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail in that case.
04/10/23, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/10/23, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/10/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

04/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 240 7949: Today it has great to learn and understanding the inside of these  programs
04/10/23, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!
04/10/23, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 240 7949: This can only be the hand of God ,it's really hard to believe.Education has become very expensive to most of us the Africans.That has resulted in school drop out
04/10/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/10/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: You see, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
04/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 240 7949: You are prophecing what is currently taking place in Zim
04/10/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Mr Piyush happened to share his experiences!
04/10/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 240 7949: Let teach all this to Phelistas so that she will testfy
04/10/23, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: You can surely discuss with her too!
04/10/23, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes, as we would conclude the session.

Are you ready?
04/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 240 7949: Yes
04/10/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Mtisi, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
04/10/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 240 7949: I will actuall climb leaders beyond our personal reach
04/10/23, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: It's great to see you are willing for your child!
04/10/23, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: Would you agree that it will be $1500-$2250?
04/10/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 240 7949: Yes I have calculated it and got the answers
04/10/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/10/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
04/10/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Mtisi, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/10/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 09 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
05/10/23, 9:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
05/10/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 240 7949: How do we pay these amounts or into account do we have to deposit the cash or have missed it
05/10/23, 9:07 am - Harmehak: The fee is paid after Phelistas is found eligible for the program through online banking modes that will be explained in her letter please.
05/10/23, 9:08 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
05/10/23, 9:08 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/10/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 240 7949: Thank you ,as you have been my teacher I will want to learn more daily
05/10/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Sure please
05/10/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/10/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/10/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/10/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 240 7949: Yes have followed through the steps and understood the rest of the steps, thank you
05/10/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/10/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).
05/10/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
05/10/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/10/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

05/10/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please, sure feel free to connect with her and learn more
05/10/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/10/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/10/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/10/23, 12:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Waiting for response
12/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 240 7949: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 2:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
12/10/23, 2:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

12/10/23, 2:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
12/10/23, 2:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 2:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 18th or 19th October 2023 for $200 and the 18th or 19th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 18th or 19th  of October 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
12/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 240 7949: Yes I want her to be enrolled with Edoofa for sure
12/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 240 7949: But she is only sitting for her exams this November to December 2023
12/10/23, 3:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Seats are being reserved in advance due to the substantial increase in application volume. Many parents are aware that enrolling their children in university after A-levels is a competitive endeavor. Therefore, proactive parents are planning ahead to secure seats, as there is a high likelihood that no vacancies will remain after the exams.
12/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 240 7949: Thank you ,yes we can start paying for her now. May I have the banking details

17/10/23, 10:29 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
17/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 240 7949: I am very happy,am the happiest person im this world,thank you so much for position of a scholarship you have offered Phelistas
17/10/23, 11:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through the acceptance letter and acknowledge it over email ?
17/10/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 240 7949: Yes I will  be depositing  same  money on Thursday or Friday this week,$200,
17/10/23, 12:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the available payment modes in depth ?
17/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 240 7949: Yes please help me finish it
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
