You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/11/23, 9:12 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.

16/11/23, 9:29 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please,

Mr Sydney, I would like to know Ryan better as a student, how he is at school, his interests and hobbies?

Kindly confirm his current subjects as well please.
16/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 435 5113: Ryan is very much interested in Sport at School, Athletics & Rugby and he is good at that. He is an intelligent guy but does not push himself to limits.  He is also very interested in new things , and always researching in all his areas of interest.

He surely seems to be a great and dedicated student, please.

Could you please confirm his current subjects?

16/11/23, 9:46 am - Harmehak: That's an interesting subject combination!
16/11/23, 9:46 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
16/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 435 5113: I am confident he will pass all the three subjects
16/11/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: It's great to see that he has your thorough support and trust.
16/11/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: So did he ever happen to discuss with you regarding what exactly he would like to opt for his higher education?
16/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 435 5113: Yes, He would want to pursue Business and Computer science
16/11/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

You see, considering his subject combination and interests, he is eligible to pursue the following:

*Bachelor in Business Administration*

*Bachelor of science in computer science*

*Bachelor in Computer Applications*

So which course shall I brief you about?
16/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 435 5113: May you just briefly highlight what makes the major differences on the three.
16/11/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Bachelors in Business Administration is related to Business Studies itself.

Bachelor of science in Computer science would involve learning more about computers please.

Both his interests are two different degrees.
16/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 435 5113: Is it possible you brief me on both. As for him, he said its about applying computers on business
16/11/23, 10:09 am - Harmehak: That's alright, if he is intrigued towards both the courses, he can surely pursue-

*Bachelor in business administration - Information Technology*

The degree would cater for both his interests!

Shall I rather brief you about this one?
16/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 435 5113: Yes, you can brief me on this one

16/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 435 5113: Well Noted. Its great and encouraging.
16/11/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mr Sydney.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
16/11/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 435 5113: Not at all
16/11/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Alright please
16/11/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 435 5113: Ok
16/11/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/11/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2700-$3700 per year as BBA- IT is a niche course that covers two different fields together so not many universities offer scholarship for the same. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/11/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 435 5113: This is well noted. and what of Airtickets, how often the Kids is on holiday and how is this paid
16/11/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: There are two semester breaks every year please.

The payments would be thoroughly explained to you thoroughly as well.
16/11/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2700-3700 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
16/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 435 5113: That is great, the reduction goes a long way in helping parents with the cost of the dream education.  We will be interested. Kindly consider us
16/11/23, 11:15 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Mr Sydney.

Sure please, we do look forward to the same,

I believe you must be aware regarding the students from Christ Ministeries who are already in India?
16/11/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 435 5113: Thats nice
16/11/23, 11:18 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 11:18 am - Harmehak: I'm also happy to share that many Christ Ministries students have been chosen for this over the previous few years. One such example is Anesu Kaunga, a former student who is also the son of *Mr. Shelton Kaunga*. He is one of Mr Sahil's students and was given the opportunity to study in India. Anesu takes great pride in belonging to the Edoofa community.
16/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 435 5113: Noted
16/11/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
16/11/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/11/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/11/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

16/11/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 435 5113: Thats understood
16/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/11/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: I am glad you found it helpful, Mr Sydney

And it's great to have you properly following the entire discussion and assisting Ryan!

So far do you have any queries please?
16/11/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 435 5113: The information has been helpful and no further queries for now. Just hope to be considered for the August 2025 intake. Thank you so much for taking your time to explain the Scholarship details.
16/11/23, 11:56 am - Harmehak: That is great, we do look forward to the same,

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. The discussion would be conducted in 10-15 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/11/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 435 5113: We can Go ahead
16/11/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Mr Sydney, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
16/11/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 435 5113: +/-$2000
16/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Mr Sydney, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 435 5113: That is OK
16/11/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/11/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
16/11/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 435 5113: That is Noted
16/11/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
16/11/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
16/11/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 435 5113: yes
16/11/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/11/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/11/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
16/11/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 435 5113: Ok
16/11/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
16/11/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

16/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 435 5113: Thats alright
16/11/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: So far are there any queries please, Mr Sydney?
16/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 435 5113: No queries yet
16/11/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
16/11/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
16/11/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/11/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

20/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So are ready to continue ahead ?
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 435 5113: Yes we are ready
20/11/23, 3:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/11/23, 3:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 25 th or 26 th November 2023 for $200 and the 25 th or 26 th of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 25 th or 26 th of November 2023.
