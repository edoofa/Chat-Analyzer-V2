I was introduced to Ms. Betty after I did some research about the program online, Ms. Betty Actually gave me  a broad  understand about how the program runs, the earn while program and a brief history about the Edoofa scholarship program.  I learned that the Edoofa program is initiated  by the Anhad Edutrain Solution .Ltd which has be a part of the education sector be for the past 13 year, it's vision is to make education affordable, accessible and employable for the students.
28/09/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: I am glad to hear that, Peter!

28/09/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome Peter!
28/09/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Peter, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
28/09/23, 11:16 am - +260 97 9398899: Well, first of all my education background. I attended my primary school at Naambe Primary School from the first grade to the seventh grade. Then I went to Broadway Secondary School where I wrote my Grade nine examination, I later  on went to Mwashi Secondary School  where I completed my Grade 12 and come the best performing pupil. I have been  desiring to study  Medicine abroad. This is because I have passion to helping petient and saving lives. My strength is that I am hard working and very social, my education strength is in mathematics and science. My weekness is geography and a bit of English. My hobbies are singing, play piano and brass instrument. I  am the first born in a  family of four, I was raised  by my uncle  who took me to school since my mother could not afford taking me to school. My uncle is an education manager at one of the local NGOs in Zambi. That's all I can think of right. <This message was edited>

28/09/23, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Well received Peter, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
28/09/23, 11:49 am - +260 97 9398899: Thank you madam
28/09/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Well Peter, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
28/09/23, 12:18 pm - +260 97 9398899: Yes of course ma'am, it is a life changing decision because it is very beneficial in so many ways. It has been my life dream. I believe that it exposes one to new ways  doing things, new lifestyles and provides variety of opportunities like advanced technology that contributes to one developing better skills and knowledge
28/09/23, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Very well, and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Peter?
28/09/23, 12:24 pm - +260 97 9398899: Yes Ms. Harmehak, am very much prepared
28/09/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Peter,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
28/09/23, 12:49 pm - +260 97 9398899: yes they are aware, and hopefully they are prepared finacially
28/09/23, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to discuss with them regarding their financial support, Peter?
28/09/23, 12:56 pm - +260 97 3563438: This message was deleted
28/09/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected?
28/09/23, 1:09 pm - +260 97 9398899: yes we are
28/09/23, 1:15 pm - +260 97 9398899: actually my parent are not able to sponsor me  for further studies, that's why I stay with my uncle, even though he is also not able to cover for it fully. that's why  we looking for sponsorship
28/09/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
28/09/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa is a scholarship program please.
28/09/23, 1:43 pm - +260 97 9398899: I have understood, thank you for making it clear for me
28/09/23, 1:48 pm - +260 97 9398899: Thanks for the clarity. I meant that my family would provide financial support towards my education once Edoofa helps me to get chance to study abroad.
28/09/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: You just hereby mentioned that you are looking for a sponsorship please.
28/09/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 9398899: Sorry. I mistakenly used the term sponsor.  Apology for that.
28/09/23, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: I understand!

Who would be the one supporting you financially, Peter
28/09/23, 2:43 pm - +260 97 9398899: My uncle whom am currently staying with
28/09/23, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.

I would like to share a document with you to go through as well please.
28/09/23, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 2:48 pm - +260 97 9398899: thank you
28/09/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me once done please.
28/09/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 9398899: Ok, can I get back to you tomorrow so that I have more time to go through, if possibble
28/09/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Sure, Peter!
28/09/23, 3:16 pm - +260 97 9398899: Thank you very much for you time I look forward to conversing with you
28/09/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
28/09/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: The discussion is scheduled for Saturday at 9 AM CAT please
28/09/23, 6:17 pm - +260 97 9398899: Noted
30/09/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
30/09/23, 9:24 am - +260 97 9398899: Good morning to you too Ms. Harmehak, yes we start please
30/09/23, 9:37 am - Harmehak: So did you go through the shared document please?
30/09/23, 9:44 am - +260 97 9398899: Yes Ms. Harmehak
30/09/23, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
3. Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you?
30/09/23, 9:59 am - +260 97 9398899: 1. I have gotten the point that the Edoofa program is not charitable Program but a program that offers scholarship to deserving students, the program helps students to obtain a lot of skills, such as critical thinking skills, better communication skills, negotiation skills and many more
30/09/23, 10:11 am - +260 97 9398899: 2. The financial aspect. The Edoofa program has $10 million scholarship funds which has be set for 2100 seats. The program has set 1500 seats for African students. And so the Earn while you learn program helps students students to earn not cush but scholarship credits, the earnings  scholarship credits depends on the performance of the students. <This message was edited>
30/09/23, 10:12 am - +260 97 9398899: 3. Yes my family is ready to support me financially Ms. Harmehak
30/09/23, 10:26 am - +260 97 9398899: 1. Furthermore the Edoofa scholarship program prepares  students and  equip  them with knowledge to help them to be  exposed to a lot of job through the Earn while u learn program <This message was edited>
30/09/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Well received please, Peter!

It's good to see you thoroughly read the document
30/09/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: May I know more about your financial understanding please?
30/09/23, 11:04 am - +260 97 9398899: Ok so the Edoofa scholarship program has  been entrusted with $10 million scholarship funds by governmental organized universities and colleges. Indian has a lot of states where these university and colleges are found, this has created a variation in the cost of living and tuition fees there for bringing the cost to $2000-$3000per year
30/09/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly followed please!
30/09/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

Isn't that exciting?
30/09/23, 11:11 am - +260 97 9398899: It is quite exciting actually <This message was edited>
30/09/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Did you discuss everything in detail with your family please?
30/09/23, 11:42 am - +260 97 9398899: Yes I explained everything
30/09/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: That's great, so far do they have any queries please?
30/09/23, 1:03 pm - +260 97 9398899: No they don't
30/09/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Very well and did you thoroughly discuss the finances as well?
30/09/23, 1:05 pm - +260 97 9398899: Not yet actually

04/10/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Well received please, it's a pleasure to know more about you!

Mr Martin, it's required because I believe you would relate when I say that international education is a big decision for Peter, and it's mandatory for us to understand everything first to avoid any inconveniences later.
04/10/23, 10:45 am - +260 97 3563438: Sure.
04/10/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries Mr Martin?
04/10/23, 11:26 am - +260 97 3563438: When are you likely to do the final selection of the awardees? And for how long do these chats take to complete the process? This is important for us to prepare.
04/10/23, 11:28 am - +260 97 3563438: Sorry am slow in responding because am multi tasking.
04/10/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: For a student who is active the counseling session can also be completed in three hours timing, meaning it would depend on your availability itself.
04/10/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: I understand please
04/10/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Peter, kindly share your grade 12 results meanwhile.
04/10/23, 11:30 am - +260 97 3563438: Ok. I see.
04/10/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: @260979398899
04/10/23, 12:09 pm - +260 97 3563438: On behalf of peter. Apology for delayed response. He is currently doing some part time work at a construction site.

04/10/23, 12:20 pm - +260 97 9398899: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
04/10/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Received Peter!

Let me get them evaluated
04/10/23, 1:03 pm - +260 97 3563438: Thank you.
04/10/23, 1:05 pm - +260 97 9398899: Thank you so much Ms. Harmehak
04/10/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: So Peter, what motivates you to study Medicine please?
04/10/23, 1:23 pm - +260 97 9398899: This message was deleted
04/10/23, 1:45 pm - +260 97 9398899: I was motivated to study Medicine when we went for a church charity program at kabwe central hospital, the way people  were waiting to be attended to by just jxt a few doctors,  but what motivated me even more is my interest in science especially chemistry I used  come out with the best grade in class
04/10/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: That's a noble motive, Peter!

I appreciate you looking out for others!

So what all did you research about the requirements to study Medicine in India?
04/10/23, 1:52 pm - +260 97 9398899: Not really, I didn't  specify. I researched only the requirements for studying medicine in general
04/10/23, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: I can understand.
04/10/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: As you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
04/10/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

*1. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
*2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy*
*3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*4. Bachelors in Optometry*
*5. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
04/10/23, 2:09 pm - +260 97 9398899: Okay I have understood Ms. Harmehak. From the above list of courses I would actually love to Study pharmacy

However, they may need to obtain additional training and certification specific to forensic science. Additionally, the specific job responsibilities and requirements may vary depending on the laboratory and jurisdiction.*
04/10/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 9398899: Interesting
04/10/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: So Peter, considering you are eligible for both the courses, 

I would like to highlight that your results would qualify for a higher percentage in case you choose Medical laboratory Technology please.
04/10/23, 3:31 pm - +260 97 9398899: Ok  Ms. Hamehak so under pharmacy I would get less percentage of the scholarship than medical laboratory technology
04/10/23, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: Yes, you would get a higher percentage under Medical laboratory Technology as per your results please.
04/10/23, 3:38 pm - +260 97 9398899: In that case then I can go for  so that we reduce the cost  but otherwise I wanted to go for pharmacy

04/10/23, 4:53 pm - +260 97 9398899: Ms Harmehak
04/10/23, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
04/10/23, 5:04 pm - +260 97 9398899: No am not familiar with the cost Ms. Hamehak
04/10/23, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
04/10/23, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/10/23, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/10/23, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/10/23, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 5:12 pm - +260 97 9398899: Okay
04/10/23, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Peter, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90-100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1400-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
04/10/23, 5:13 pm - +260 97 9398899: Understood
04/10/23, 5:16 pm - +260 97 9398899: Thank you for the tip Ms. Hamehak I appreciate your service
04/10/23, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries please?
04/10/23, 5:22 pm - +260 97 9398899: I don't have any query Ms. Harmehak You have made it clear for me
04/10/23, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful!

Lets discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would assist you further.
04/10/23, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/10/23, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/10/23, 5:28 pm - +260 97 9398899: Understood
04/10/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

04/10/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/10/23, 5:37 pm - +260 97 9398899: I sounds great
04/10/23, 5:37 pm - +260 97 9398899: Appreciated
04/10/23, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/10/23, 5:46 pm - +260 97 9398899: Indeed I have Ms. Harmehak
04/10/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

Peter, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
04/10/23, 5:48 pm - +260 97 9398899: Yes am ready Am ready
04/10/23, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: Peter, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
04/10/23, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/10/23, 5:58 pm - +260 97 9398899: Need to pay a minimum amount of $1500 Ms. Harmehak
04/10/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/10/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*

04/10/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: Peter, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/10/23, 6:04 pm - +260 97 9398899: Yes Ms. Hamehak
04/10/23, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/10/23, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/10/23, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/10/23, 6:08 pm - +260 97 9398899: Appreciated
04/10/23, 6:08 pm - +260 97 9398899: Appreciated
04/10/23, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
04/10/23, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
04/10/23, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/10/23, 6:16 pm - +260 97 9398899: I have understood
04/10/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/10/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).
04/10/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
04/10/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 6:23 pm - +260 97 9398899: So you mean to say that I if all goes  well I will be able to travel to India before august
04/10/23, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Peter!

04/10/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
04/10/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

09/10/23, 11:01 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
I hope you had a great weekend
Shall we start your interview session now ?
09/10/23, 1:27 pm - +260 97 9398899: Yes sir
09/10/23, 1:28 pm - +260 97 9398899: Sorry for late response I ran out of bundles unfortunately
09/10/23, 2:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zambia, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zambia is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zambia, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zambia has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zambiaean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
09/10/23, 2:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
09/10/23, 2:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies.

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
09/10/23, 2:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 2:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 2:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th or 15th October 2023 for $200 and the 14th or 15th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th or 15th  of October 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
09/10/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 3563438: <Media omitted>
