As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
16/11/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: That's great, Mr Victor.
16/11/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
16/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
17/11/23, 5:19 am - +263 77 871 2687: Thanks for the information, that sounds good. I'm more than confident
17/11/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
17/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 871 2687: Good morning, how are you
17/11/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: I am doing well, Mr Victor

17/11/23, 11:58 am - Harmehak: So Mr Victor, did Providence research before opting for her subject combination please?
17/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Yes, she did
17/11/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright, what specifically made her opt for the subject combination that is Statistics, Crop science and geography please?

She can pursue *Bachelor in Geography*, which would cater for her interests.
17/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 871 2687: It's not a problem she can do since it's one of her subjects
17/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Thanks for the guidance

17/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 871 2687: This is quite pleasing. I wish my daughter enrolls to one of the institutions
17/11/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
17/11/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: We look forward to the same
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 871 2687: No, idea as yet
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 871 2687: I will be grateful if you could provide me with the information
17/11/23, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
17/11/23, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT, do ensure active participation so that we can conclude the counseling session and proceed with further stages.

I wish you all a blessed evening ahead!
18/11/23, 7:04 am - +263 77 871 2687: Thank you, same to you
18/11/23, 9:12 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 871 2687: Good morning how are you. I'm quite okay. Yes please
18/11/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: I am doing well, thank you!
18/11/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
18/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 871 2687: Nothing bad about the idea, I do agree with you
18/11/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Mr Victor!

I am glad!
18/11/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Mr Victor, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
18/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 871 2687: I don't agree there, tuition fees ranges from $ 1600-2000 while accommodation and other necessities may cost upto $1500 on a plate of sadza yes I do agree
18/11/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Mr Victor, so as per what you too shared the costs add upto $3100-$3500, isn't it?
18/11/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 871 2687: Yes please
18/11/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: Correct
18/11/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: So having gone through the costs, are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India please?
18/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 871 2687: Yes of course
18/11/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
18/11/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/11/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/11/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 871 2687: It's doing quite great a job
18/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 871 2687: Okay I understand
18/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 871 2687: This is good
18/11/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/11/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 871 2687: It sounds good
18/11/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 871 2687: I really appreciate what we have discussed so far. We can have another conversation again when you are free. As of now I am going to attend a church service that starts at 1030 until 1530 . Good day
18/11/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please!
18/11/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Lets connect at 3:30 PM CAT!
18/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Good afternoon
18/11/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Good Afternoon Mr Victor!
18/11/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
18/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Sorry I have been traveling to see my family. I have just arrived I don't know if we can continue.
18/11/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: I understand the same so we surely can, Mr Victor.
18/11/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: Mr Victor as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
18/11/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 871 2687: The student ends up spending $1500-$2250
18/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Mr Victor, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Really, I think so
18/11/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/11/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
18/11/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 871 2687: I do understand please
18/11/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: That's great Mr Victor
18/11/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
18/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
18/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Yes please, I do understand
18/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
18/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
18/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Thanks for the information I will communicate with her
18/11/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Mr Victor.
18/11/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
18/11/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/11/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.

18/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: I wish you a blessed evening ahead and a happy family discussion
20/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
20/11/23, 10:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 11:55 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
21/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Hello, how are you. I had no network since yesterday
21/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Yes please
21/11/23, 1:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
21/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 871 2687: It was fantastic. I really enjoyed it.
21/11/23, 2:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
21/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Yes, please. Truly I appreciate the way she managed her family's needs as a single parent. She's a dedicated mother.
21/11/23, 3:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?
7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
21/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 871 2687: 1. Bachelor in Geography
2. India
3. $6000_$8000
4. $2000- $3000
5. $350
6. 7 days
7. Yes, please
21/11/23, 7:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
21/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Yes, please
21/11/23, 9:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
21/11/23, 9:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th   of November 2023.

How are you doing today?
24/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 871 2687: I'm doing well.I was waiting for the discussion of the letter.
24/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through the student's acceptance letter and did you manage to discuss it as a family?
24/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 871 2687: Yes, please.
24/11/23, 2:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
24/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 871 2687: It's alright
24/11/23, 3:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
24/11/23, 3:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
