29/11/23, 3:24 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

29/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 408 1482: Just Edoofa ,I have been searching for reliable source like yours
29/11/23, 3:29 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
29/11/23, 3:30 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 3:30 pm - Arshita: Let me know know once you are done
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 408 1482: Yes am done , I understand
29/11/23, 4:06 pm - Arshita: May I know which your interest in engineering why didn't you opt for science in A level?
29/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 408 1482: There were no sciences at the school that I attended A level
29/11/23, 4:41 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics ,  Chemistry and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily. <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 4:42 pm - Arshita: Since you are not having science you are not eligible for the same. 

Do you have any alternate career aspirations?
