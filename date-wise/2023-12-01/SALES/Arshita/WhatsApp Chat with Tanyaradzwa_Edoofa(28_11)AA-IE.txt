Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of Agriculture?
29/11/23, 12:41 pm - +27 74 913 4096: I used to learn Agriculture in Primary. And I also learnt a lot about Agriculture at A level in my Geography subject as it has a topic called Agriculture and Food Security

29/11/23, 12:47 pm - +27 74 913 4096: My A level results are not yet out
29/11/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: Noted. 

Can you please confirm me your subjects in A level?
29/11/23, 12:48 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Economics, Geography, Business Studies and Computer science
29/11/23, 12:49 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
29/11/23, 12:49 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
29/11/23, 12:50 pm - +27 74 913 4096: I am very confident that I did well in my A level exams
29/11/23, 12:53 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
29/11/23, 12:53 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
29/11/23, 12:54 pm - +27 74 913 4096: I haven't actually applied to any University abroad as most of them open their applications early next year but it's in  my plans and goals to apply for universities abroad
29/11/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
29/11/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: Let me know once you are done

So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
29/11/23, 1:35 pm - +27 74 913 4096: According to my research about India and its education system I have discovered that the Indian Education system is quite effective but after asking from those who have learnt in India, I've discovered that some lecturers do not teach in English which might prove to be difficult for African students. I've also heard about the hostel situations regarding hygiene which was said to be quite poor. And that in India they do not allow African students to work and earn. I don't know how much truth there is to that. But I'm hoping with Edoofa that will be different from my own findings
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
29/11/23, 3:30 pm - +27 74 913 4096: No..but it is quite expensive
29/11/23, 3:32 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
