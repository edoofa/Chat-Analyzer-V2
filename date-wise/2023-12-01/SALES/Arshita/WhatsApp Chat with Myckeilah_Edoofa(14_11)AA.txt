It costs US$100 per term.
I would like to take medicine. It has always been my passion to study medicine. In actual fact, I got the motivation to be a doctor and save lives from my society. People are dying of some diseases and ailments that could or can be treated. It therefore, came as an inspiration for me to do better and save lives!!
I love interacting with others . It is one of my strengths,that is, talking and socialising with others. 
I am very good at absorbing pressure very well and handling a lot of tasks very well therefore, multitasking is my strength as well.
I am also very fond of reading , through reading I ge to understand and know better hance reading is my strength as well.
Nonetheless, sometimes I can be very shy to start a conversation with other people, strangers to be specific. I get cold feet when it comes to being open with other and that serves to be a weakness.

During my spare time, I love reading. It helps me to have a better view about something.
I also love playing board games like chess. 

I come from a family of 2 children and a single parent.My mother is a domestic worker. She has always been our financial support system. Her highest level of education was upper 6.
I have an older brother who's 19years old currently studying architecture part time.
27/11/23, 4:33 pm - Arshita: Good to see that you are from Mashonaland , it is near to Harare
27/11/23, 4:33 pm - Arshita: Harare is very close to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year.

27/11/23, 6:28 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
27/11/23, 6:28 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 430 3418: Yes I am confident of achieving it.
27/11/23, 6:30 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
27/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 430 3418: I haven't started with the research, I was thinking of doing that this upcoming december holiday
27/11/23, 6:32 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
