We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program as referred by Fanwell. 

As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *12:00PM CAT Friday (01/12/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counselling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
