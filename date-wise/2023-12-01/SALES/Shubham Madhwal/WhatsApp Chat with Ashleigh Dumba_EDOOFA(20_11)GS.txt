20/11/23, 12:48 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Adella, also do tell me whether you learnt about Adella’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
20/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 562 9724: Edoofa is an Indian based organization

It affords international students to enroll for higher education in lndia

It aims to provide education opportunities to All.

It provides scholarship of between 50% and 100%. 

The Edoofa board carries out an eligibility test for prospective students.

There is also an opportunity for earn as you learn.

Adella told me that she had a Hussle free journey. Her only complain was the hot weather she had to endure at the time she went to lndia beginning of September
20/11/23, 1:08 pm - Sagar: Great answers Mrs.Mercy, I see you are well informed.
20/11/23, 1:08 pm - Sagar: But let me also brief you about the program.
20/11/23, 1:08 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 562 9724: Thank you sir
20/11/23, 1:09 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/11/23, 1:09 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 150 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/11/23, 1:09 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 562 9724: So true
20/11/23, 1:12 pm - Sagar: I would love to know If Ashleigh is available for the session?

20/11/23, 1:16 pm - Sagar: Okay so Mrs Mercy, as we start Ashleigh's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 1:16 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 562 9724: Sure i do
20/11/23, 1:20 pm - Sagar: Alright so Mrs.Mercy, I would like to know you better as a parent, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish Ashleigh to study, his strengths, his weaknesses, his hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your work (Place) in your country or any other country that you have relocated to due to work promises?

I hope this message finds you all in the best of your spirits.
21/11/23, 9:34 am - Sagar: So are you available for the session?
21/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 562 9724: Good morning, Ashleigh is not available at the moment he's at school
21/11/23, 9:39 am - Sagar: And when will he be available?
21/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 562 9724: Am  sure around 1
21/11/23, 9:58 am - Sagar: Till then can we continue the session?
21/11/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 562 9724: Yes
21/11/23, 10:16 am - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if Ashleigh is provided with this career option how do you see him 5 years after the completion of this course and if he gets into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable him to achieve his dreams?
21/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 562 9724: Upon completion l expect him to work for up to three years while he gains after training experience.

 I would expect him to save money to buy workshop equipment. 

During his time with seasoned employers l also expect him to establish contacts in the field. 

He should establish his own company in the first five years of his post course completion. My dream is to see him assisting upcoming learners by giving them opportunities for internship.

And l expect and desire him to further develop himself educationally. <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 12:19 pm - Sagar: That is really great Mrs.Mercy I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which Ashleigh has chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Do you think he is willing to give his 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come his way inorder to transform his career?
21/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 562 9724: With our support and advice I am sure he is willing
21/11/23, 12:33 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to make him work hard for his career, however, can you please tell me why you want him to study abroad and not in your country?
21/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 562 9724: Local fees are much higher as compared to India.

The gurus in the engineering departments in my country are trained broad. Our local engineers  learn from the best abroad that's why l am in favour of him being considered abroad. 

He stands an opportunity to be considered for scholarship, that will help me in a big way to see that my son attains higher education. 

India has educational institutions that are internationally recognized.
21/11/23, 1:02 pm - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue his higher education through this scholarship, how is he planning to contribute his learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 562 9724: Like l pointed above, l would expect him to contribute towards employment creation. He would need to acquire machinery for use in a factory or any related field, where he will employ and provide attachments to learners. 

I would expect him to establish a skills training school
21/11/23, 1:15 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mrs.Mercy, but in order to do that Ashleigh would have to study with his utmost dedication which would only be possible if he has a conducive environment around him.
21/11/23, 1:15 pm - Sagar: Don’t you agree?
21/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 562 9724: I do agree 100%
21/11/23, 1:16 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years?
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 562 9724: True
21/11/23, 1:18 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
21/11/23, 1:18 pm - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

21/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 562 9724: Yes we are
21/11/23, 2:09 pm - Sagar: So now Mrs.Mercy, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
21/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 562 9724: So far I think I don't have any questions
21/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
21/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 562 9724: No we do not
21/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
21/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/11/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/11/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: In simple words Ashleigh what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.* <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
21/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 562 9724: Sorry yes doing this while at work
21/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
21/11/23, 4:39 pm - Sagar: Well Ashleigh, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

22/11/23, 10:12 am - Sagar: Alright, let us continue the session by explaining EWYL in depth.
22/11/23, 10:13 am - Sagar: Ashleigh, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 10:13 am - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
22/11/23, 10:13 am - Sagar: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/11/23, 10:13 am - Sagar: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 562 9724: EWYL is doing a great job
22/11/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

22/11/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

22/11/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 562 9724: So informative
22/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 491 7961: Noted
22/11/23, 10:58 am - Sagar: So now Ashleigh, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
22/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 491 7961: No questions,l have understood
22/11/23, 12:12 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
22/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 491 7961: No we are not
22/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
22/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 491 7961: I can see its very affordable as compared to the UK and the USA
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 491 7961: Noted
22/11/23, 12:33 pm - Sagar: In simple words Ashleigh what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 491 7961: The difference is very remarkable
22/11/23, 12:34 pm - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
22/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 491 7961: So the money which l earn from EWYL program will be for my own personal use?
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - Sagar: No Ashleigh, You will earn scholarship credits through EWYL which will be real money, but it will be used to reduce your fees and to help you self-finance a major part of your education.
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 491 7961: Oh,oky thank u
22/11/23, 12:50 pm - Sagar: This message was deleted
22/11/23, 1:01 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
22/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 491 7961: Yes
22/11/23, 1:07 pm - Sagar: Ashleigh as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 491 7961: $1500-$2250
22/11/23, 1:14 pm - Sagar: Exactly Ashleigh, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/11/23, 1:14 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 491 7961: Yeah,its affordable
22/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 491 7961: Oky
22/11/23, 1:18 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
22/11/23, 1:18 pm - Sagar: Don’t you think so?
22/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 491 7961: Yes it is
22/11/23, 1:23 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/11/23, 1:23 pm - Sagar: Ashleigh basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sagar: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
22/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sagar: *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
22/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sagar: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sagar: However Ashleigh, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 491 7961: Yeah,the level of economic instability is high in most African countries
22/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 491 7961: This will help parents very much
22/11/23, 1:33 pm - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
22/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 491 7961: No
22/11/23, 1:37 pm - Sagar: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/11/23, 1:37 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: This message was deleted
22/11/23, 1:39 pm - Sagar: Alright Ashleigh, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
22/11/23, 1:39 pm - Sagar: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
22/11/23, 1:39 pm - Sagar: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/11/23, 2:18 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
22/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 491 7961: Yes
22/11/23, 2:29 pm - Sagar: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/11/23, 2:29 pm - Sagar: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025. <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 2:30 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
22/11/23, 2:30 pm - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
22/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 491 7961: I have understood
22/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 491 7961: No thank you
22/11/23, 2:37 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
22/11/23, 2:37 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*
