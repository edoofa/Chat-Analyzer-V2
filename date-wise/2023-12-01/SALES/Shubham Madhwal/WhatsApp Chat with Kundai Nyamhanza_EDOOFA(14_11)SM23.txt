Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

30/11/23, 9:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?

30/11/23, 1:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Kundai I would like to update you that, this session itself acts as a basic evaluation platform for me to choose a worthy candidate for the scholarship. The more you share the better results you will receive from our session and I will be able to guide you to a brighter future.

I shared with you a question, but you answered it in a single sentence. 

So if you still think that this answer justifies my question, then that is well in good. We can proceed ahead.

So please let me know your opinion so that I can continue ahead accordingly!
30/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 346 3741: After 5 years I see myself being a great person and someone who will be able to help others in line with the field that I will be studying. Also t add on I will be ble to help the country because I want to have my own company and also creating employment to others
30/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
30/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 346 3741: Yes of course 💪🏼💪🏼
30/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
30/11/23, 5:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This message was deleted
30/11/23, 5:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

God Bless You! 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
30/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 71 346 3741: Sure
