23/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
23/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 441 5087: Good evening
I had asked earlier if there's another time which the session can be conducted which isn't 10 am because I will be occupied at around that time
24/11/23, 11:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Chantell, How are you?
24/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!
