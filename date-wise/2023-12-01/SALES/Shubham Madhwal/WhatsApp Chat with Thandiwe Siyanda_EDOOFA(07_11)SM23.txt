My name is Thandiwe Siyanda a student who is selected for the prestigious Edoofa scholarship program to study my tertiary education in India .l always wanted to study abroad after the recent fees hike at the Zimbabwe Universities  where there school fees range from ZWL 550000 to 700000 per every term which has 3 months .When I calculated the yearly costs including food and accommodation it was more than 3000 USD at our country (Zimbabwe). As i compared this amount of money with my family ,my parent couldn't afford it because they are unemployed  (poor).As i talking to you seniors,I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Furthermore at our country many seniors are unemployed after graduation. I want to support my family through partial employment during studying the course and this is when I heard about the  Earn while You Learn Program at Edoofa which gives the opportunities to Earn $100-$150 per month .My parents can afford it because it is less expensive as compared to Zimbabwe.
07/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail
07/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*

07/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 467 8032: I'm interesting on that sir
07/11/23, 3:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*. In case they are not available right now they can still be a part of the group and catch up with the conversations later.

08/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 577 7311: Edoofa Scholarship program was initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions India.
Is a work-study model program which believes in quality education accessible to all
08/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
08/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
21/11/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 467 8032: Yes we can start how are you sir
21/11/23, 10:14 am - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

21/11/23, 10:33 am - Shubham Madhwal: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
21/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 467 8032: Yes i have it
21/11/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 467 8032: Yes sir i have a question in my mind what exactly reasons why Edoofa recommends india as a higher education destination
21/11/23, 10:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

1. *Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education. Students can choose from a wide range of disciplines, including politics, philosophy, engineering, medical sciences, biology, business, and media/journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* Indian universities emphasize a rigorous academic curriculum that combines theoretical knowledge with practical skill development. Students have opportunities for cutting-edge research projects and collaboration with experts.
21/11/23, 10:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Faculty Expertise:* The faculty members in Indian institutions are highly qualified and bring industry expertise to the classroom. They provide quality instruction, mentorship, and guidance to nurture students' academic and professional growth.

5. *Global Recognition and Career Prospects:* Indian degrees are globally recognized, opening doors to a wide range of career opportunities worldwide. Graduates from Indian institutions have achieved success in various fields globally.

21/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 467 8032: Oky sir i learn a lot about India country and the richness
21/11/23, 11:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
21/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 467 8032: The reasons why i choose to study in India than in my country because 1 in India there is a lot of universities and colleges with lower education cost and it various loans, scholarship and financial assistance program which are available to support students as compared in Zimbabwe there education cost are very higher and students who are going to study tertiary level are those from rich family. Inaddtion in India they provide a degree which is used worldwide and they offer opportunities to stedent to engage in cutting edge research and innovation that in our country they could not offer. I noticed that graduates from India they have achieved success in various fields global.Moreso i noticed that in India they celebrate cultural festivals and providing students with a multicultured environment which improves the standard of abilities and characters of a student.
21/11/23, 12:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
21/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 467 8032: No i did not do  any research
21/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 467 8032: On foreign education
21/11/23, 1:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great So as you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
21/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 467 8032: No sir i don't have any knowledge about the cost but some people tell me that the price are low can you tell me the cost sir
21/11/23, 1:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
21/11/23, 1:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
21/11/23, 1:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
21/11/23, 1:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 1:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
21/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 467 8032: Thank you for the updates
21/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall i now brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
21/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 467 8032: I can afford 2000
21/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate?
21/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 467 8032: Yes
21/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

22/11/23, 2:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
22/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 467 8032: This message was deleted
22/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 467 8032: Wonderful
22/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with  me!
22/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 467 8032: I think so it is the edoofa program  profile starting to know knowledge from stage 1 to stage 6
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee.
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalmentsm thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 467 8032: Oky sir i understand this cycle
22/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
22/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
22/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
22/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
22/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
22/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
22/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 467 8032: This message was deleted
22/11/23, 4:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: And why do you like this point please/

23/11/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 467 8032: Yes sir I'm available but network problem
23/11/23, 11:12 am - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
23/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 467 8032: My parents
23/11/23, 1:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
23/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 467 8032: Yes you  tell me
23/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
23/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 467 8032: Oky i understand
23/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
23/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
23/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 467 8032: I get it
23/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
23/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
23/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
23/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
23/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 467 8032: Oky
23/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
23/11/23, 5:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so I have an assignment for you, No need to panic as the answers to every question is resting in this chat itself, so make sure if you don't know the answer find it from the chat and then write it down
