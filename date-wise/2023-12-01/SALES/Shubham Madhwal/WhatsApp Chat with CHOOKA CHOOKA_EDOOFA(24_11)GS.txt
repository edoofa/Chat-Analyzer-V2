24/11/23, 11:11 am - Sagar: Good Morning Chooka!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes I did...
We can discuss
24/11/23, 3:27 pm - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Chooka,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
24/11/23, 3:29 pm - +260 97 1436967: Alright thank you
24/11/23, 3:31 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Chooka, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Felix, is that correct?
24/11/23, 3:34 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes sir
24/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Felix, also do tell me whether you learnt about Felix’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
24/11/23, 3:40 pm - +260 97 1436967: Well,I didn't get enough information that's why I was curious to communicate to an admin..but about the journey and experience of Felix I know something
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sagar: Ok let me brief you about the program.
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
24/11/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
24/11/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
24/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/11/23, 3:54 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes Mr Gurvinder,you are right
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: Okay so Chooka, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24/11/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes though my parents are not on WhatsApp,but my aunt can help
24/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: noted.
24/11/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: Alright so Chooka, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
24/11/23, 4:17 pm - +260 97 1436967: I'm 18 years old,zambian
Went to canisius secondary school and just wrote my grade 12 exams 3 weeks ago,I would like to study economics,I'm weak in sciences,I play basketball
I'm fourth in a poor family of 4 based in monze, southern province, zambia.My parents don't work,my mother is Ill although my father is a bricklayer.If that's not enough you can ask me anything else.
25/11/23, 9:09 am - Sagar: Noted.
25/11/23, 9:10 am - Sagar: Good Morning Chooka,
I hope you are doing well.
25/11/23, 9:11 am - Sagar: In your introduction you wrote that your parents don't work, so may I know who has been supporting you for your education and if they are willing to support you for your higher studies.
25/11/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 1436967: I was supported by the school under bursary,only for secondary level
25/11/23, 4:53 pm - Sagar: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

27/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
27/11/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 1436967: It is sir, exactly what I was looking for
27/11/23, 2:20 pm - Sagar: Chooka, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes
27/11/23, 2:34 pm - Sagar: Alright Chooka, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
27/11/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
27/11/23, 6:05 pm - +260 97 1436967: Yes
27/11/23, 6:07 pm - +260 97 1436967: I said my parents can't afford
27/11/23, 6:20 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
27/11/23, 6:22 pm - +260 97 1436967: Thank you and same
28/11/23, 8:41 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Believe you can and you're halfway there."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
28/11/23, 9:21 am - +260 97 1436967: Good morning
28/11/23, 9:24 am - Sagar: Alright, let us continue the session.
28/11/23, 9:25 am - Sagar: Yes Chooka, I understand that, but I am saying whenever you will need help financially, will your parents support you?
28/11/23, 9:26 am - +260 97 1436967: Yes my family can help
28/11/23, 9:27 am - Sagar: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
28/11/23, 9:28 am - +260 97 1436967: I told them about Edoofa's program
28/11/23, 9:39 am - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
28/11/23, 9:41 am - +260 97 1436967: Yes
28/11/23, 9:43 am - Sagar: Chooka as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?* <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 9:46 am - +260 97 1436967: about $1500
28/11/23, 9:47 am - Sagar: Exactly Chooka, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/11/23, 9:48 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 1436967: Okay, nice
28/11/23, 9:49 am - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
28/11/23, 9:49 am - Sagar: Don’t you think so?
28/11/23, 9:51 am - +260 97 1436967: Yes
28/11/23, 9:56 am - Sagar: Chooka basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
28/11/23, 9:59 am - +260 97 1436967: Okay
28/11/23, 10:01 am - Sagar: However Chooka, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 10:03 am - +260 97 1436967: Okay
28/11/23, 10:03 am - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
28/11/23, 10:04 am - +260 97 1436967: Not really
28/11/23, 10:11 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 10:12 am - Sagar: Alright Chooka, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
28/11/23, 10:12 am - Sagar: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
28/11/23, 10:12 am - Sagar: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
28/11/23, 10:20 am - +260 97 1436967: Yes
28/11/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
28/11/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
28/11/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
28/11/23, 10:25 am - +260 97 1436967: No
28/11/23, 10:28 am - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
28/11/23, 10:28 am - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
28/11/23, 10:28 am - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
30/11/23, 4:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
