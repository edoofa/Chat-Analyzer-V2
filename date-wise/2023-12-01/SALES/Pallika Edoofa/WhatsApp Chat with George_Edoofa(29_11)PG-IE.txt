29/11/23, 7:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these, May I know why the grades are low?
29/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 756 4664: Okay due to financial issues l got the ZIMFEP scholarship later and l joined others later so l was very much behind and l also faced some serious health problems during this period but l'm okay now.
29/11/23, 7:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, George, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/11/23, 7:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
29/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 756 4664: Yes l'm very confident that l can aim for higher and better grades
29/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 756 4664: I haven't done much research on foreign education and have not applied to any university abroad so far
29/11/23, 8:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 756 4664: Okay thank you
30/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 77 756 4664: Good morning
30/11/23, 8:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
30/11/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 756 4664: Sorry my network is low today
30/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 756 4664: Yes
30/11/23, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, I understand! 


Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
30/11/23, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 756 4664: Okay noted
30/11/23, 10:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, George, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
30/11/23, 10:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

Do you want me to explain in depth?
30/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 756 4664: Yes explain a bit further on the program
30/11/23, 10:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science. Medical laboratory technologists play a crucial role in the healthcare system by conducting various laboratory tests and analyses that assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.

During the program, students are trained in various laboratory techniques, sample collection, testing procedures, and result interpretation. They learn how to handle and analyze different types of biological samples, such as blood, urine, tissue, and body fluids. *The curriculum also includes theoretical and practical courses in subjects like microbiology, biochemistry, hematology, immunology, and pathology.*

*Upon completion of the program, graduates can pursue careers as Laboratory Technicians, Laboratory Managers, Medical Officers, Research Associates, Medical Record Technicians, Resident Medical Officers, Lab Assistants, Laboratory Testing Managers, or even pursue teaching positions as Associate Professors or Lecturers in the field of medical laboratory science.*

Job opportunities for medical laboratory technologists can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, healthcare clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists' offices, and other healthcare facilities. They work closely with healthcare professionals, such as doctors and pathologists, to provide accurate and timely laboratory test results that contribute to patient care and treatment decisions.

*Overall, a B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology provides graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform laboratory tests, contribute to medical research, and make a valuable impact in the field of healthcare.*
30/11/23, 10:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope this course aligns with what you've been aiming for*
30/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 756 4664: Yes thank you
30/11/23, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
