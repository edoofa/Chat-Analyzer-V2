Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, You would be happy to know that the DEOs of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High, and many others.

*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for Vuyisile's career, aren't you?* <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Definitely
23/11/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Ms. Khumalo
23/11/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that he receives access to the best opportunities?
23/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Nothing much, was hoping there's some sponsorship involved with your program
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
23/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 274 1769: It's ok
23/11/23, 8:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Network is bad once we lose electricity. Will be ready tomorrow at 1230
24/11/23, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Sorry was at work, just knocked off. I'm ready now
24/11/23, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Khumalo, 

How is your day progressing?
24/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 274 1769: The heat is killing us here
24/11/23, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand the hot weather is quiet uncomfortable!!
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Khumalo, Continuing the discussion, As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that hereceives access to the best opportunities?
24/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Let us know the opportunities then where our input is required we will make a plan
24/11/23, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
24/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 274 1769: It depends on the fees
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this
24/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Yes I did go through, I can't say I will afford when I don't know how much fees cost
24/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 274 1769: U hv mentioned that u only cater for at least 50% fees but I want to know it's 50% of how much
24/11/23, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from approx *$6000-$8000 per year* in India, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to approx *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity.


Will you now be able to manage? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Could try
24/11/23, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, It's reassuring to hear your perspective, Ms. Khumalo. I want to emphasize that the initial investment is a one-time commitment. Once Vuyisile is enrolled in the program, his Admission and Earning While You Learn (EWYL) process will kick off immediately. Through dedicated effort, he'll be earning approximately $50-$100 in scholarship credits monthly. This not only eases the financial load but empowers Vuyisile to actively contribute to his higher education expenses. It's a sustainable approach that aligns with our commitment to making education accessible. Your trust in this process is truly appreciated, and we're excited to support Vuyisile on his educational journey.
24/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Thank you
24/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 274 1769: If I may ask what kind of jobs do these students do
24/11/23, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Khumalo, Please note that the EWYL projects are online. In India, international student isn't permitted to do part-time to ensure they focus on education completely. The same is ensured in the Earn While You Learn Program. Just imagine, you having a physical job. You have to travel from your residence and prepare your routine accordingly which would affect your study hours, especially during exams. Now, the Earn While You Lear Program offers projects that are online which you can perform at your residence itself with flexibility in working hours which allows a complete balance between the program and education!
24/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Great

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin with your session?
27/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 274 1769: Yes sir
27/11/23, 1:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?

27/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 863 0867: Literature in English - B
History - C
Family and religious studies - C
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
27/11/23, 3:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 863 0867: I understand
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 863 0867: I did, I looked into a number of universities in countries such as South Africa and Zambia, to name a few
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 863 0867: Okay
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

29/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 863 0867: I am and so is my family
29/11/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Vuyisile, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/11/23, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?* <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 863 0867: I can't say for sure
29/11/23, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You can have a discussion with your family regarding this, Vuyisile, Also, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.
