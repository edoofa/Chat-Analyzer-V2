So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
18/11/23, 12:13 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Without scholarship u can’t go anywhere because we as parents we can’t manage to pay the need’s off our kid’s  but u can get a hand off help u can achieve the india it’s the best with the Edoofa idid   Cherk on Facebook as well idid see other kids who where there before wich means it’s good to get help with Edoofa
18/11/23, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Ndlovu, Thank you for sharing this, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation* <This message was edited>

18/11/23, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Silenkosi, Please have the discussion!!

18/11/23, 12:38 pm - +27 78 063 3835: For example 2024 u have to pay  300 for the rest off the year   Or it’s full courses
18/11/23, 12:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Ndlovu, it's important to clarify that the fees of $2000-$3000 are annual and vary based on the duration of the specific course Silenkosi chooses. Additionally, you are not required to pay the entire amount upfront. The payment can be made in installments, with two semesters in a year as mentioned above.
18/11/23, 12:48 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Ok I do understand
18/11/23, 12:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Ndlovu, Proceeding further, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done? <This message was edited>

18/11/23, 12:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!!
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Silenkosi, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis

18/11/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
18/11/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
18/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 349 4463: Yes that's the best way of alleviating financial burden on parents
18/11/23, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.

Regarding your worries, we have a dedicated department called *DSW (Student Welfare Department)*, which actively engages with individual students 3-4 times a week to address any challenges they may be facing. This proactive approach ensures that issues are identified and resolved promptly.

Moreover, parents are allowed to visit their children, and vice versa. During vacations after exams, students have the opportunity to reunite with their families. This helps maintain a connection between students and their parents, fostering a supportive environment.

22/11/23, 6:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that, unlike Zimbabwean universities, the cost of education remains the same throughout the course of an Edoofian. As mentioned, the cost of education after scholarship ranges $2000-$3000 per annum including tuition, Food, Accommodation, Wifi, laundry, library fee etc. The exact cost of education will be mentioned on the offer letter that a student receives. This cost can be further reduced through the Earn While You Learn Program
22/11/23, 6:44 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Noted with thax iwant to understand everything don’t get me rong
22/11/23, 6:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No problem, Ms. Ndlovu

23/11/23, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin the session?
23/11/23, 1:33 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Yes we can
23/11/23, 1:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this, Ms. Ndlovu, how you feel for the same?
23/11/23, 1:51 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Yes  we are
23/11/23, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Ndlovu, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make Silenkosi's  career advance at an even greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help her in uplifting her family there by herself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to her parents.
23/11/23, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
23/11/23, 3:27 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Silenkosi will answer I can’t  answer  this one thank u
23/11/23, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Ndlovu, Please note that these requirements are the main requirements.
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - +27 78 063 3835: I can help her to pay  fees as it’s responsibilities for parents to pay the fees because she’s child she’s not working  that’s why  isaid ineed all requirements so that ihave to nkow intime what she’s gonna what’s the cot’s off every I can’t  just jump up and find my self    In debit with that’s why I need to nkow everything before i sign anything as parant

24/11/23, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
24/11/23, 1:01 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Good afternoon yes we can
24/11/23, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well today.
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Yes thank u
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Ndlovu, As we about to finish the counseling session today, Please note that When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
24/11/23, 1:25 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Ido understand  thx u
24/11/23, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let me explain when and why the enrollment fee is paid as This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
24/11/23, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/11/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

24/11/23, 10:15 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Ok thanks
27/11/23, 12:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin with your session?
27/11/23, 1:16 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Am good thank yes we can
27/11/23, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Ms. Ndlovu?
27/11/23, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are clear with the process that we discussed in the previous session.
27/11/23, 1:29 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Am well thank u
27/11/23, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You're welcome!!

27/11/23, 1:43 pm - +27 78 063 3835: 1 and 5
27/11/23, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Ms. Ndlovu,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
27/11/23, 1:45 pm - +27 78 063 3835: Yes
27/11/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
