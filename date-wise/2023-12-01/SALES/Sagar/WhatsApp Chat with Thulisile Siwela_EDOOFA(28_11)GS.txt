30/11/23, 9:20 am - Sagar added +263 78 928 2752
30/11/23, 9:20 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Thulisile,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
30/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay I understand
30/11/23, 9:22 am - Sagar: Alright, so Thulisile, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Hester, is that correct?
30/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 928 2752: Yes
30/11/23, 9:23 am - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Hester, also do tell me whether you learnt about Hester’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
30/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 928 2752: I got to learn that it provided him with an opportunity to fulfill his dreams related to higher education and that it is a work-study model that helps people in need of employment and funding for a higher education.
30/11/23, 9:29 am - Sagar: That is correct.
30/11/23, 9:29 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the program myself.
30/11/23, 9:29 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
30/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay sir
30/11/23, 9:29 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
30/11/23, 9:30 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
30/11/23, 9:30 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
30/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 928 2752: Yes that's really what I'm looking for
30/11/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: Okay so Thulisile, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
30/11/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
30/11/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
30/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 928 2752: Yes sir
30/11/23, 9:39 am - Sagar: Alright so Thulisile, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
30/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay I'm Thulisile Siwela, a lady aged 18, I have a passion in food, and I'd love to work in the Food Industry as a nutritionist of food technologist and maybe even a chef.  I completed my O'level in 2021 with 4 A's and 5 B's and I proceeded to do my Alevel at bus, but I haven't yet wrote my exams. My strengths are : good communication skills, ability to interact with new people, ability to adapt to a new environment . I'm also a fast learner and quick to grasp info and I believe my IQ is high. My weakness so far is I tend to be a perfectionist.
30/11/23, 9:52 am - Sagar: Great answer, Thulisile.
30/11/23, 9:52 am - Sagar: So Thulisile, could you kindly tell me how much *Bulawayo Adventist High School* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in? <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 928 2752: I was born in a family of 6 children and I'm the last born. Mother died in 2011 when I was 7 and things just changed thereafter. Our father got depression and the farm which was our source of income trembled and we almost lost everything. Our father then remarried 7months later and he sent us to live on our own in town. So right now we are a child headed family and my sister being the bread winner
30/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 928 2752: My school fees is USD $324  per term and my father is the one who pays it with help from my sister and brother too
30/11/23, 9:54 am - Sagar: I am so sorry to hear about this, Thulisile.
30/11/23, 9:54 am - Sagar: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process

30/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 928 2752: It's just been a natural love for food that I've had since a young age. Food is like a puzzle that needs to be put together, from the way it is harvested to it being prepared, to it being cooked ,to it being eaten, to it being used up by the body, it's just something that fascinates and is interesting to me. I love discovering and knowing more about the foods that we consume and the usefulness of it in our lives because basically without food we just won't exist

30/11/23, 10:34 am - Sagar: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*
30/11/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 928 2752: I'll considere doing that but allow me to research on it
30/11/23, 10:37 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the course.
30/11/23, 10:37 am - Sagar: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.
30/11/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.
30/11/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.
30/11/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.
30/11/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.
30/11/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
30/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 928 2752: Okay that's really an interesting course
30/11/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: Did you understand the course?
30/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 928 2752: Yes and it covers most of the things I'm interested in
30/11/23, 10:43 am - Sagar: That is great.
30/11/23, 10:43 am - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
