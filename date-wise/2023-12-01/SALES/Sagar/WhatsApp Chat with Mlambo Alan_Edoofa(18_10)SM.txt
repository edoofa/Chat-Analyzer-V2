I am *Mr. Sagar*, Career Counselor at Edoofa. Joining me today are *Mr. Shubham*, our Senior Academician, and *Mr. Joytishman*, our Head Admissions Officer.

Could you please come online so that we can discuss this further?
18/10/23, 5:46 pm - Sagar: Dear Students and Parents,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

*In light of the ongoing exams and considering that some students and parents may not be readily available during the day, I've decided to extend my working hours to include a night session. This way, we can ensure that no one misses the opportunity to engage in discussions and move forward with the next stages of the program.*

Please feel free to join the night session, and together, we'll work towards making your educational aspirations a reality.

*I will be available from now till 10:30 PM CAT*
18/10/23, 10:06 pm - Sagar: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:30 AM - 4:30 PM CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

19/10/23, 4:37 pm - Sagar: Hi, I hope you are doing well.
I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

21/10/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: *So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program*

Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
21/10/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
21/10/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High*, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s,*Shalom Academy*, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
21/10/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
21/10/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 942 0514: Soo what will be the required fee so as to receive the acceptance letter
21/10/23, 12:20 pm - Sagar: After completion of this counseling session, a student undergoes the eligibility check test and interview. If the student is found eligible in that stage then the student receives the scholarship!

In case the student is not available, parents can participate and complete the application process.
21/10/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 942 0514: Ok it's fine so l will be waiting for that counselling
21/10/23, 12:24 pm - Sagar: Alan, we are now undergoing the counselling session!
