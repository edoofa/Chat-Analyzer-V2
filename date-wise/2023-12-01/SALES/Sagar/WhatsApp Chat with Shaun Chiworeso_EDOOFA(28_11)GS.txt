*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/11/23, 8:13 am - +263 78 288 5102: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
29/11/23, 8:39 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Shaun,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 368 6228: Good morning. I am Mr Chiworeso, its my pleasure to join this interactive discussion
29/11/23, 8:48 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you Mr.Chiworeso.
30/11/23, 8:23 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the key that unlocks the golden door to freedom.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/11/23, 4:39 pm - Sagar: Hi Shaun, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
30/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 288 5102: Good afternoon sir.
I apologise for my delay in communication and any further inconveniences caused on your side.

But as of now, I can guarantee you I am available for discussion
30/11/23, 4:47 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
30/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 288 5102: Very well sir I understand.
Enjoy the rest of your day😊
