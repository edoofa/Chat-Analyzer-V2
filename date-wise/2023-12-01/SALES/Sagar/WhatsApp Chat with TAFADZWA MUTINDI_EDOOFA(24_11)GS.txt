27/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 420 2036: I learn Tavonga's journey with Edoofa was been quite the experience mostly
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Sagar: I see you are well informed Tafadzwa.
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Sagar: But let me also brief you about the program.
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 420 2036: Thank you Mr Gurvinder for informing me
27/11/23, 4:06 pm - Sagar: That is not a problem.
27/11/23, 4:06 pm - Sagar: Please address this.
27/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 420 2036: Yes i accept the offer
27/11/23, 4:10 pm - Sagar: Okay so Tafadzwa, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 420 2036: Yes i think i qualify in these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - Sagar: Alright so Tafadzwa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
27/11/23, 4:50 pm - Sagar: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 4:50 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

28/11/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 420 2036: Oky
28/11/23, 10:38 am - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
28/11/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 420 2036: Yes i have confident about achieving it

30/11/23, 8:20 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the key that unlocks the golden door to freedom.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 420 2036: Good morning how are you Mr Gurvinder
30/11/23, 9:14 am - Sagar: I am fine, how are you?
30/11/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 420 2036: I'm fine
30/11/23, 9:20 am - Sagar: Let us now continue the session.
30/11/23, 9:20 am - Sagar: So now Tafadzwa, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
30/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 420 2036: Since my mother is the one who is going to pay the fees for me and she is a Vendor approximately how much is she going to pay per month
30/11/23, 9:33 am - Sagar: Please be patient Tafadzwa, let us continue with the counselling session, all your concerns related to this topic will be addressed ahead.
30/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 420 2036: Oky lets proceed
30/11/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: So now Tafadzwa, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
30/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 420 2036: I understands I don't have a question
30/11/23, 9:42 am - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
30/11/23, 9:45 am - +263 78 420 2036: No
30/11/23, 9:47 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
30/11/23, 9:47 am - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/11/23, 9:47 am - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/11/23, 9:48 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 9:48 am - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/11/23, 9:48 am - Sagar: In simple words Tafadzwa what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 420 2036: Oky Mr Gurvinder
30/11/23, 9:54 am - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
30/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 420 2036: Yes
30/11/23, 9:59 am - Sagar: Tafadzwa, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
30/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 420 2036: Oky
30/11/23, 10:03 am - Sagar: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
30/11/23, 10:03 am - Sagar: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
30/11/23, 10:04 am - Sagar: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

30/11/23, 10:04 am - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
30/11/23, 10:04 am - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
30/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 420 2036: It is good and i will benefit
30/11/23, 10:09 am - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that Tafadzwa, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 420 2036: Oky
30/11/23, 10:18 am - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 420 2036: Yes my family would be supporting me for my higher education
30/11/23, 1:50 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/11/23, 4:45 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.
