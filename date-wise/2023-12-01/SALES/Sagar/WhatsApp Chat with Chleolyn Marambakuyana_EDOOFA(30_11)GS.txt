30/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I'm currently studying my lower 6 at Chinhoyi High School which is located in Mashonaland Province of Zimbabwe.  I'm from a middle class family and both my parents are  civil servants.My mother is a police officer and my Father is an educational facilitator. Due to the deteriorating economy of my country, my parents' income is not enough to provide for us all . I have my elder sister who's  studying  her Bachelor's degree with Midlands State University and she's in her Second year. I also have a little brother who will be enrolled for form one in 2024.Due to my parents' income, sending us all to school has been a challenge and as a result , it has been my major reason for looking out for a schoolarship. If given the opportunity, l would like to study Medicine. Adapting to change has been my strength lately as well as   striving so hard in my academics to produce good results. Fear of failure has been my major weakness in my life.
Thank you 🙏
