29/11/23, 7:57 am - Sagar: Good Morning Ruvimbo, Mr.Mutara!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/11/23, 7:59 am - +263 78 443 5194: I'm sorry sir but my mom disagree to this
29/11/23, 8:37 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Ruvimbo,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 8:37 am - Sagar: Can I know why is that?
29/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 443 5194: She said India is too far
29/11/23, 9:05 am - Sagar: But Ruvimbo, India offers quality education at a lower cost and provides scholarships to support you. Students studying in India from your country here in India are in many thousands.
29/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 443 5194: Yes but my mom doesnt understand dat
29/11/23, 12:58 pm - Sagar: Let me add her to the group, and after we finish the counselling session she can decide that.
29/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 443 5194: She is not on WhatsApp these days
30/11/23, 8:22 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the key that unlocks the golden door to freedom.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/11/23, 4:38 pm - Sagar: Hi Ruvimbo, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
