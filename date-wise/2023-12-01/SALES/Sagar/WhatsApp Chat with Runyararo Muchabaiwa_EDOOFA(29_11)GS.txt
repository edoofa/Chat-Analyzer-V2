29/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 198 8842: Noted sir
29/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Runyararo I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Anotidaishe, is that correct?
29/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 198 8842: Yes it's correct
29/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Anotidaishe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Anotidaishe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 198 8842: I would say Edoofa is the best ,l got to know that it helps me to choose the right program for me to study,you help throughout the process and that's good thing
29/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 198 8842: Anotidaishe didn't say much but with the little information l got and the other information l came across with,l just got interested in Edoofa
29/11/23, 12:24 pm - Sagar: Noted.
29/11/23, 12:24 pm - Sagar: Let me also brief you about the program?
29/11/23, 12:24 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/11/23, 12:24 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/11/23, 12:24 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/11/23, 12:24 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 198 8842: Yess Mr Gurvinder that's absolutely true
29/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 198 8842: Noted sir I got everything,this is wonderful
29/11/23, 12:27 pm - Sagar: Okay so Runyararo, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 198 8842: Yes Mr Gurvinder I have
29/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 198 8842: My parent is not yet in the group sir

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*
29/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 198 8842: Okay Thank you Mr Gurvinder
29/11/23, 4:11 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
29/11/23, 4:11 pm - Sagar: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 198 8842: Noted sir
29/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 198 8842: I very confident and l hope to achieve good points
29/11/23, 4:17 pm - Sagar: That is great.
29/11/23, 4:18 pm - Sagar: So should I brief you about the course?
29/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 198 8842: Yess sir please do

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

30/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 198 8842: Noted, Good morning sir
30/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 198 8842: I am now active
30/11/23, 9:27 am - Sagar: That is really great Runyararo, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
30/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 198 8842: I am willing
30/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 198 8842: I will give it my all andtake all the opportunities
30/11/23, 9:33 am - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
30/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 198 8842: The reason is it has been also one of my wishes to study abroad by adoring others who are doing plus I have always wished to visit India so I saw the opportunity and I want to grab that not only that I want to meet different kind of people by interacting with them and other cultures
30/11/23, 9:39 am - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
30/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 198 8842: If I learn and make it l would like to also contribute by paving a way for other children in my country to pursue their studies further through affordable school fees
30/11/23, 9:47 am - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Runyararo, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
30/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 198 8842: Yes Mr Gurvinder I agree
30/11/23, 9:49 am - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
30/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 198 8842: Indeed it is sir

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
30/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 198 8842: No sir I am understanding everything
30/11/23, 2:50 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?

30/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
