18/11/23, 10:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Casper. India's pharmaceutical and chemical sector has attained global recognition, standing out as a powerhouse in innovation, production, and export. Renowned companies such as Sun Pharmaceuticals, headquartered in Mumbai, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories in Hyderabad, have demonstrated a commitment to high-quality research and development, solidifying India's position on the world stage. In the chemical sector, Reliance Industries, led by the visionary Mukesh Ambani, has diversified its portfolio, making substantial contributions to India's economic growth. Beyond companies, Indian leaders like Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation, exemplify the nation's prowess in global business leadership. This collective success underscores India's significant impact on the international pharmaceutical and chemical landscape, showcasing innovation, competitiveness, and a commitment to excellence!
18/11/23, 10:59 am - +263 71 132 2777: That is the type of environment that i desire to be educated in sir, the one with people who are anxious to discover more on what is in the field not to set a limit in your career path
18/11/23, 10:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
18/11/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 132 2777: I only know that they offer affordable fees but the actual figure, i am not so sure sir
18/11/23, 11:04 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Casper! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
18/11/23, 11:04 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 11:04 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
18/11/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 132 2777: So each semester is $1000 or not
18/11/23, 11:14 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Casper. This cost is paid in two equal installments. Each installment is paid before a semester. There are two semesters in a year
18/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 132 2777: Yes i think it is affordable taking account of what is included in the cost
18/11/23, 11:27 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Casper! However, we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
18/11/23, 11:33 am - +263 71 132 2777: Yes it sounds impressive and it helps with the cost
18/11/23, 11:33 am - +263 71 132 2777: Well can you enlighten me on how its done
18/11/23, 11:34 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Casper. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/11/23, 11:34 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
18/11/23, 11:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/11/23, 11:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
18/11/23, 11:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
18/11/23, 11:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
18/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 132 2777: This will truly be beneficial because this will open my mind to see opportunities in situations which might seem locked to others and i might also gain experience in working industry
18/11/23, 11:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
18/11/23, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
18/11/23, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
18/11/23, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

18/11/23, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
18/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 132 2777: Wow its truly amazing how miriam kept in touch and gained much, this is incredible
Truly they will reduce the pressure
I love the program, i believe that when a manage to be accepted i will follow the EWYL program seriously
18/11/23, 8:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Casper. I strongly believe that, with your diligence and intellect, you will establish a superior path!
18/11/23, 8:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
18/11/23, 8:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
18/11/23, 8:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
18/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 71 132 2777: Well first and foremost i appreciate the affordability through guaranteed scholarships because that is the ticket to reach my destination <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 8:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Casper! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
18/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 132 2777: Well my favorite one is the first one which is the affordability through guaranteed scholarships
18/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
18/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 132 2777: A few of them have got mixed reactions but most of them are in agreement with me studying abroad
18/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Casper. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
18/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
18/11/23, 9:18 pm - +263 71 132 2777: I think think there should be an addition of -grades from high school
-copy of passport
-financial statement 
-reference letter

That is what i think should be included
18/11/23, 9:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
18/11/23, 9:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
18/11/23, 9:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 9:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*

21/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 132 2777: How are you sir 
I think what you do assures the students of a higher percentage of getting a place in the university because  i think the main worry would be the fact that is i invest the certain amount and do not get the place what will i do so with edoofa's assistance it will be a better flow
21/11/23, 9:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Casper!
21/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 71 132 2777: I am sir thank you
21/11/23, 9:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
21/11/23, 9:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
21/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 132 2777: So what is the Alevel pass as per edoofa
21/11/23, 10:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
21/11/23, 10:04 pm - +263 71 132 2777: I surely am thank you for the insight
21/11/23, 10:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I strongly believe that you will pass your exams with flying colours, Casper!
21/11/23, 10:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
21/11/23, 10:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Casper Taruvinga Edoofa (16/11) SZ" to "Casper Taruvinga Edoofa (16/11) SZ 2025"
21/11/23, 10:28 pm - +263 71 132 2777: Well generally i have understood that when you want to apply for an international university you will need an application fee
And a statement of purpose which has a higher cost because it has to be drafted elsewhere by professionals, but this doesn't give you a guarantee that you are going to get the place 
But with the help of edoofa which helps with the registration process you can get through the whole process with a fair fee reduced from 750-350
But this can happen after you receive an acceptance letter from the academic Board and then you will be given a span of 7 days to pay and after paying you will start the earn while you learn program for you to earn credits which will help even in paying the fees
21/11/23, 10:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
21/11/23, 10:30 pm - +263 71 132 2777: Ok i understand sir <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 10:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 10:40 pm - +263 71 132 2777: Before I answer am i to fill the ofline registration and hand it to you
21/11/23, 10:51 pm - +263 71 132 2777: 1.personalised counseling session
21/11/23, 10:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Casper. We already received your form before the counseling session, please.
21/11/23, 10:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
21/11/23, 10:52 pm - +263 71 132 2777: Ok sir
21/11/23, 10:54 pm - +263 71 132 2777: Explain please <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 10:55 pm - +263 71 132 2777: Yes you can explain 5 and 6
21/11/23, 10:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
21/11/23, 11:03 pm - +263 71 132 2777: So at step 5 
The registration fee will be part of the  first year fee which you said ranges from 2000-3000 or ?
21/11/23, 11:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Casper. This isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself ($2000-$3000).
21/11/23, 11:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: With great enthusiasm, I would like to expound upon the details of our meeting with *Mr. Shelton Kaunga, the esteemed Head of Christ Ministries High School in Harare.*

21/11/23, 11:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Furthermore, I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
21/11/23, 11:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
