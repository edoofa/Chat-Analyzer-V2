23/08/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You too @263715657295 <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Anesuishe!
I hope this message finds you well.

I am *Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer* at Edoofa. As we gear up for the 2023 intake, I have been diligently reviewing the applications of our prospective students. During this process, your admission file caught my attention, and I'd like to discuss a significant aspect with you.
31/08/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I noticed that you were previously offered a remarkable opportunity by MVN University, presenting a generous 90% scholarship on your tuition fee. However, according to your application, it appears you decided to pursue your education at PDM University. This contrast in choices has prompted me to reach out to you, as I believe this decision holds more potential than meets the eye.

I am eager to explore this further and would like to know if now is a suitable time for us to connect and have a meaningful discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion? <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Good evening Sir.How are you?

Yes ,we are ready?
31/08/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine please, thank you for asking. Thank you for your willingness to engage in this discussion. Before we get into the details, I would appreciate it if you could share the thought process that led you to choose PDM University over MVN University, especially given the attractive 90% scholarship offered by MVN. This will help me understand your thought process better and then provide you with valuable feedback that can ensure you start your career right.
31/08/23, 9:57 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Well Sir,l just have this attachment with PDM as it was my first offer letter.
31/08/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I truly value your perspective, and it's clear that PDM University holds its merits as a preferred choice. I want to assure you that your choice of PDM is entirely valid and commendable.

However, I would also like to present an alternative viewpoint. Through recent conversations with the academic board and interactions with students, MVN University has surfaced as a university with exceptional potential. Its reputation for academic excellence, combined with its commitment to holistic student development, has garnered substantial recognition.
31/08/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: For a moment, I want you to Imagine an environment where modern infrastructure, well-equipped classrooms, state-of-the-art labs, extensive libraries, comfortable hostels, and ample sports facilities converge to create an optimal learning atmosphere. MVN University takes pride in fostering an all-encompassing educational journey and hence it seems to be a better fit for you and your family.

What sets MVN apart is its unwavering dedication to innovation and nurturing students' holistic growth. This focus positions MVN as a formidable contender against any institution. While PDM University undoubtedly has its merits, MVN's comprehensive approach offers a unique blend of academic prowess and personal development.
31/08/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moreover, let's consider the financial aspect. Opting for MVN University would substantially lower your educational expenses. To put things in perspective, the annual costs at MVN are nearly half of what you would incur at PDM. This equates to obtaining a superior education, coupled with valuable cost savings, which could significantly impact your long-term financial outlook. I hope you are following?
31/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 273 7728: Yes
31/08/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 273 7728: Following
31/08/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Yes
31/08/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Following
31/08/23, 10:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: In essence, PDM is undoubtedly a strong choice, and MVN's merits simply provide an additional dimension to consider. We understand that every student's journey is unique, and our intention is to present you with a holistic perspective so you can make an informed decision that resonates with your aspirations.

Hence, the academic board has asked you to reconsider your university choice and give it a through thought before you commence your visa application process.
31/08/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 273 7728: Sure ,okay Sir
31/08/23, 10:20 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Okay Sir
31/08/23, 10:24 pm - +263 71 565 7295: I have a question Sir, does MVN also provide food??
31/08/23, 10:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Anesuishe, Regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please. I hope this is clear?
31/08/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Yes Sir ,clear
31/08/23, 10:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I want you to take your time to discuss this as a family and keep in mind all the points that I have shared with you here. And then we will connect with each other tomorrow at 10.00 AM to discuss and plan the way ahead. Until then, have a pleasant evening!

01/09/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 565 7295: Yes ,Sure
01/09/23, 10:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please dear. Now, let me share the same information with the university officials as well. 

Moving ahead, as you may recall that the admission fee for MVN University is $1000 and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. Can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey? <This message was edited>

They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 13th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
09/09/23, 10:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
09/09/23, 10:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Anesuishe 2K23JAN0525*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
09/09/23, 10:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.
