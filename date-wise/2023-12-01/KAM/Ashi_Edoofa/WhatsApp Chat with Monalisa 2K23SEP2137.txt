I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
03/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes we can start our discussion
03/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 339 4557: I'm done going through the image representing the admission process
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
03/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes ma'am
03/10/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
03/10/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
03/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Understood mam
03/10/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
03/10/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
03/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes ma'am they're clear
03/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
03/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 339 4557: This message was deleted
03/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes ma'am
03/10/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

06/10/23, 12:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Monalisa.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
06/10/23, 12:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/10/23, 12:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/10/23, 12:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

07/10/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Qus2: Cavitation refers to the formation of air bubbles in fluid in low pressure condition which is lower than the saturation pressure.Its a potentially damaging condition in which the fluid in pipes/sewers is at high velocities.As fluid pressure is less than saturation pressure, dissolved gases are released from fluid and these air bubbles will suddenly collapse when the flow enters into a region of higher pressure.This produces a high dynamic pressure which causes damage to the pipeline due to it's high frequency.

07/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Qus3:Soil reinforcement is a mechanical means of stabilizing weak soil that involves the use of fibrous material as geosynthetics.Its a way to increase the strength and stiffness of soil .It reduces soil erosion at marshy land and river boundary sand on soft ground the construction will be done directly. It's importance is time saving,ease of construction and overall economy. *Weak* *foundation*- causes a building to collapse.If you build a building with cheap and less strong materials. *Natural Disaster*- floods ,seismic tremors, coincidental acts such as an explosion in the service system/terrorists bombing. *Corrosion*-water exposure is a primary cause of corrosion on steel building framing,but it's not the culprit.Steel bars inconcrete elements that are exposed to chloride/saline environment like slabs and columns found in parking garages *.Faultly construction*-the amphitheater was cheaply constructed with wood and not able to with stand 5000 people who came to watch the gladiator games causing it to collapse. *Corruption*- the inspection system that have allowed unsafe construction to flourish. *Soil liquefaction*- it makes the soil lose its strength and rigidity.
07/10/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Mivan construction method (technology)is a modern method that is suited for construction of large-scale structures especially when repetitive slabs and blocks are involved.Mivan is not used widely in India but is very popular in Gulf countries.Area of use preferred for constructing a large number of houses in a limited period of time without any trouble make sure of room size structures to construct slabs and walls.It permits shuttering for both slabs and columns in construct.Walls of huge room size as well as floor slabs are done right through this kind of Mivan shuttering.They are sturdy and strong forms and are constructed with the utmost accuracy plus it's easy to manage.Mivan 's major features are cycle time, durability, striking time and load carrying capacity

07/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
07/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes ma'am lm ready
07/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
07/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
07/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
07/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
07/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes you right
07/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
07/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
07/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
07/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is  Ms Jasmine and he/she has scheduled my session for 10-10-2023 from 08:30am to 9:30 am
07/10/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Jasmine. I appreciate you sharing the session date and time with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled date at 08.30 AM. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for your academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
07/10/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and a great weekend ahead.
07/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes he did
07/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Thnk u mam
09/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Monalisa.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion? <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 431 8082: Hallo mam
09/10/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, it is a pleasure to connect with you today, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 431 8082: Yes we are mam
09/10/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. So may I know if you are clear so far?
09/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 431 8082: Yes we are
09/10/23, 7:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 431 8082: Yes we are
09/10/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

$2000 - $3000 Range:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
09/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 431 8082: Yes mam
09/10/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 339 2726: Good evening how are you?
09/10/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening to you too, I am doing great, I hope you are doing well too.
09/10/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
09/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 339 2726: I am fine thank you.
09/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so may I know if you were able to go through my messages above?
09/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 339 2726: Yes
09/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
09/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Evening mam,lm doing good hope you also doing good
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263783394557 Thank you for asking, I am doing great and I am glad to know that you are doing well, too. May I know if you were able to go through my message above?
09/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 339 4557: I assume it's from here right?
09/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes ma'am
09/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Understood mam
09/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Understood mam
09/10/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 431 8082: We don't have any queries mam
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 431 8082: Thank you mam
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
09/10/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 431 8082: Understood mam
09/10/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to connect with you soon, however, you responded late, and since it is almost past our available working hours now so I would love to connect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm. I hope you will be available.
09/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Ok mam
09/10/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Noted mam
09/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 431 8082: Okay mam
09/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 78 339 4557: We will be available mam .
10/10/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 339 4557: No I have understood mam
10/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 339 4557: May you please provide me more information
10/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
10/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Understood mam
10/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
10/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes ma'am
10/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 339 4557: I agree with the options
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Mam as I carry the three options above do l still do EWYL program?
10/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263783394557 yes please, as the EWYL program is not only going to help you learn more skills, however, but with those skills you will even be able to earn scholarship credits from which you can further reduce your cost of ahead and help reduce your parents burden as well.

I hope we are clear now?
10/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes perfectly clear mam
10/10/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes ma'am
10/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes crystal clear ma'am
10/10/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Ok
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 339 4557: No ma'am I don't
10/10/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
10/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes ma'am
10/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Oky mam may u also have a nyc dae
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Monalisa.

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?

15/10/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 339 4557: Yes I have
15/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 339 4557: <Media omitted>
15/10/23, 11:00 am - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear. This means that when you will come to India in 2024, you would have to submit your A-Level Results before that to complete your registration process. I hope this is clear?
15/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Oky now I understand thank you for clarifying that point
15/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 431 8082: Mrng
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 339 4557: It's oky, hope you are now feeling well.
15/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 339 4557: 1*Pre semester tuition fee after scholarship is *$900.* 2*Standard Duration of my course is *3years(six semesterd)* 3*The Admission and procedure fee is *$300.* 4*Registration fee is *$750*.
15/10/23, 10:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes it's clear
15/10/23, 10:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 10:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 10:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Noted
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes we together
15/10/23, 10:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 10:26 pm - +263 78 339 4557: You can proceed sir.
15/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
15/10/23, 10:31 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes sir
15/10/23, 10:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 10:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 10:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Oky sir
15/10/23, 10:37 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes sir
15/10/23, 10:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/10/23, 10:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/10/23, 10:43 pm - +263 78 339 4557: We stay in Gweru  ( Midlands Province)
15/10/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/10/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/10/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/10/23, 10:47 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Oky sir
15/10/23, 10:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
15/10/23, 10:50 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Yes sir
15/10/23, 10:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
15/10/23, 10:55 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Noted
15/10/23, 10:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800 <This message was edited>
15/10/23, 11:08 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Noted
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Monalisa!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 339 4557: Mrng hwau sir
16/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 339 4557: Ok
16/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 339 4557: Understood
16/10/23, 11:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
