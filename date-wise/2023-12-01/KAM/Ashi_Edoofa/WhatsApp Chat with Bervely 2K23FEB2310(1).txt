02/08/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 293 6331: What might be the right contents of the affidavit given that on the application form it was stated that parents' consent is required if the student is below 18 years of age. She is 19.
03/08/23, 7:08 am - Vilsha Edoofa: @263772936331, the affidavit from the parents is the same document as the letter of sponsorship. The format for the letter was shared with you earlier during our conversation. 

Your parents/guardian can act as the sponsor for the visa application process and issue the letter of sponsorship. In the letter, he/she would have to clearly mention his/her relationship with you as your guardian. Additionally, the bank statement provided for the visa application should be that of your guardian/parents, as they will be financially supporting your education.

To ensure a smooth and successful visa application, it is crucial to provide all necessary documentation, including a well-written sponsorship letter with all relevant details.
