It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Wow , that's great news 🙂
21/09/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Yes , we are together
21/09/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
21/09/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students.

21/09/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
21/09/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Thank you 😊. I clearly understand
21/09/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/09/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Okay.
21/09/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Let's do it
21/09/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
22/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Good afternoon Sir
22/09/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
22/09/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Noted. Thank you 😊.
25/09/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely afternoon?
25/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Good afternoon 😊
25/09/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Yes. An ready
25/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
25/09/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Yes . That's clear
25/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.
25/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.
25/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
25/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Yes . I understood it all
25/09/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/09/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Yeah. That's awesome
25/09/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
25/09/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
25/09/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/09/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/09/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 091 8221: No , everything is crystal clear 🙂
25/09/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 091 8221: No. You can tell me about it
25/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/09/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Thank you for the explanation. I understood
25/09/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/09/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Yeah
25/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
25/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Thank you 😊. Stay blessed
26/09/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Munyaradzi !

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Greetings to you Sir. We can begin the session
26/09/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/09/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Yes. That's clear
26/09/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/09/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this? <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Yeah ! I get it
26/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Well. That's clear
26/09/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 091 8221: No , Sir. We can proceed
26/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter? <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Yeah ☺️
26/09/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Okay 😊. That's awesome

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

29/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Munyaradzi!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
29/09/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Good afternoon sir, yes as a parent I did go through the letter
29/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Right now Munyaradzi is at school. But I am available to discuss with you
29/09/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 238 8254: May I have the clear picture of what as parents have to pay in full per annum, I can't understand the breakdown of fees on the offer letter
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, I will make sure to help you in having a proper understanding of the offer letter and I will answer all your queries as well further during our discussion. Before that, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
29/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 238 8254: 1. $900
2. 4yrs(8 semesters)
3. $300
4.$750
29/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 238 8254: I am Munyaradzi's mother I am the one who is available, so iam responding
29/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
29/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Yes it's clear
29/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Now what about the accommodation fee how much do we pay
29/09/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
29/09/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
29/09/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
29/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 238 8254: So it means that schoolership only cover for tuition fee is that so
29/09/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right, the scholarship that is offered to you covers the tuition fee please. Now, Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
29/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Yes we are together
29/09/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
29/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Yes I am aware of the Exam fee
29/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Yes it's clear
29/09/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Yes very clear
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 238 8254: So the $750 will be deducted from the $900 tuition fee
29/09/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please it would be deducted from the first year fee. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
29/09/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
29/09/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
29/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Yes we are on the same page
29/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Iam getting it as a parent
29/09/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
29/09/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 238 8254: We stay Harare  and we have opened an mastercard international bank account for  Munyaradzi does it work or we have to use the alternative way
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 238 8254: OK I get it
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
29/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Yes we did so and I think it's easy since Munyaradzi have an FBC account
29/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 238 8254: If it for Mr Karwi I have the details
29/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 238 8254: We used Mr Karwi's  FBC account
29/09/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, excuse me for the confusion, you had used Mr. Shorwi Kawadza's FBC Bank to make the payment, right?
29/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Yaa that was Shorwi sorry
29/09/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
29/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 238 8254: Received thank you
29/09/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
29/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 238 8254: May I ask
29/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 238 8254: How can we arrange for oof cumpus accommodation whilst we are in Zimbabwe
29/09/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you do not have to arrange that, the university officials along with the Department of Student Welfare here at Edoofa will help you in arranging that please. I hope this is clear?
29/09/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 238 8254: OK it's now clear
29/09/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Greetings. Thank you for the clarification.... We have totally understood what you have said ..... So I will opt for the Off-campus accommodation because it is Affordable.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Munyaradzi!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
30/09/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 238 8254: Yes we are clear
30/09/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 238 8254: Good morning to you too sir
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munyaradzi!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
03/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Greetings 🙏🏾
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents Munyaradzi!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead with our discussion here, can you please let me know if you are clear till here please?
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munyaradzi!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
09/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 78 091 8221: Greetings to you Sir. I think everything is clear, for now we don't have any questions
09/10/23, 5:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munyaradzi!

Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
