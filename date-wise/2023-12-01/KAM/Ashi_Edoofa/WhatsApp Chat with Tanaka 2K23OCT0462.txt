16/10/23, 7:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777824648 I understand that your current financial situation, and it's crucial to plan accordingly. The good news is that you will receive Offer Letters from multiple universities, giving you the flexibility to decide on the institution that suits your needs and budget the best. This means you don't have to make a payment until you're certain about your university choice. 

Typically, the process of receiving an Offer Letter takes around 3-4 days. In the meantime, I recommend using this waiting period to make a detailed financial plan that might ease the financial burden. <This message was edited>

17/10/23, 6:04 pm - +263 71 229 2869: I think this enough for me, you can also help were have taken it wrong in writing
17/10/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263712292869 that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
17/10/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
17/10/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
17/10/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
17/10/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
17/10/23, 6:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
17/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 71 229 2869: Network problem bt trying to get in touch with you

18/10/23, 8:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

Thank you for your response, I am glad to know that you will submit your SOP form and other documents today after your exam, All the best for your exams. 

It's important to reiterate the significance of these forms, as you are well aware that your EWYL session is set to commence today. Completing your SOP forms by today is essential to ensure you can embark on your exciting EWYL journey without any delay and be on track with your peers.
20/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Question 2📝

 The difference between rights and duties is that rights are something you are entitled to, while duties are something you are obligated to do. For example, a right might be the right to a fair trial, while a duty might be the duty to obey the law. Human rights are the basic rights that all humans are entitled to, such as the right to life, liberty, and security of person. Civil rights are the rights that are specifically guaranteed by a country's constitution or laws, such as the right to vote or the right to freedom of expression.
20/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Question 3📝

A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in a criminal case, while an attorney is a lawyer who represents a client in any type of legal matter. Prosecutors are typically employed by the government, and their job is to present the case against the defendant in a criminal trial. Attorneys, on the other hand, can work in a variety of settings, including private practice, government, or non-profit organizations. They may represent either plaintiffs or defendants in civil or criminal cases, and may specialize in a particular area of law.
20/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Question 4 📝

I'm most interested in the area of civil law. Civil law covers a wide range of issues, from contract disputes to personal injury claims, and I find the variety of cases and the opportunity to help people resolve their legal problems to be very interesting. Additionally, civil law often involves more negotiation and problem-solving than other areas of law, which I believe would be a good fit for my skills and personality.
20/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Question 5📝

Well, I think one of the  skills l believe l have is  the ability to think critically and analyze information. This means being able to break down complex issues and make logical arguments. For example, one day at school we were given a  case to determine the best legal strategy to pursue, and l interpret a statute and apply it to a specific situation.
21/10/23, 8:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanaka, Wishing you all a Wonderful Day!

Thank you for sharing your response to the respective academic question, I have taken a note of them. On the same note, May I kindly get an update on the SOP form, Have you been able to complete the form?
21/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah only left with question 1
21/10/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777824648 I wanted to discuss something of great importance with you. As we are all aware, the EWYL session that was scheduled to begin yesterday has now passed. I wanted to take this opportunity to encourage you to actively participate in our upcoming sessions.
21/10/23, 7:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Since the scheduled session date has already come and gone, I kindly request that you fill out the EWYL form once again for the next session, which is set for the 24th of October. Please share the form with us, so that we can update our records as well.
21/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Oky am here its just am busy with exams
21/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 782 4648: On 24 October l have an exam
23/10/23, 7:34 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanaka, I hope you've had a wonderful weekend. 

Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding your upcoming exam. I understand that juggling your studies and participation in our sessions can be challenging at times. In the spirit of effective communication and to better accommodate your schedule, I kindly inform you to inform us in advance when you anticipate unavailability for our sessions. This way, we can plan and adjust accordingly to ensure a smooth and productive learning experience.
23/10/23, 7:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: Looking ahead, with your exam scheduled for the 24th of October, I've discussed the matter with our team. Recognizing the importance of striking a balance between academics and this valuable journey towards higher education, we've come to a solution. We would like to inform you that you have the opportunity to join the program on the 27th of October. This will allow you to have the time and focus needed to excel in the upcoming exams while also ensuring that this educational journey remains a priority.
23/10/23, 8:15 am - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah 27 October its oky
23/10/23, 8:15 am - +263 77 782 4648: Good morning maam how are you that end

24/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Good afternoon everyone here
24/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah l have understood
25/10/23, 8:11 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanaka, I hope you are doing well. 

Kindly excuse me for not attending your message at the earliest as yesterday was a holiday on the occasion of Dussehra. In order to move ahead with the journey, I would like to know if you are available for the session now?
25/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Hie good afternoon am now available
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263777824648, I am glad to know that you are available for the session now. Before, we proceed further, i would like to know if you have completed the EWYL form?
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 782 4648: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
25/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/10/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah the information is correct
25/10/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/10/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/10/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/10/23, 7:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yes ma'am
25/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Oky maam
25/10/23, 7:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/10/23, 7:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/10/23, 7:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/10/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Oooh can you explain on the reduction to zero
25/10/23, 7:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263777824648. The registration fees is reduced to zero as this is not a extra fees.
25/10/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Oooh oky so it will cover my first year fees
25/10/23, 7:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263777824648. The registration fees is only time one fees which will be required in order to reserve your seat.
25/10/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Oky now l get you ....thank you <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 7:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah but can you make it clear that on this 2000 to 3000 is the same that cavers the accomodations , food and other basic expanses
25/10/23, 7:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777824648 Your all doubts will be cleared as we move forward with the session, Please be assured that all your queries will be assisted
25/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Its oky maam get you
25/10/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
25/10/23, 8:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
25/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Oky now its clear thank you
25/10/23, 8:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777824648, We will continue our session tomorrow at 12:00pm as my operational hours are concluded. Have a blessed night!
25/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Thank the same there

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 8:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 8:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

14/11/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 6:46 am - +263 77 782 4648: Ooooh really thats great🥳
15/11/23, 6:46 am - +263 77 782 4648: Oky noted ma'am
15/11/23, 12:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanaka,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 12:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Afternoon how are you
15/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah we have read it
15/11/23, 12:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263777824648, I am doing well thank you for asking. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah we can start
15/11/23, 12:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 782 4648: 1.$1800
2.5years
3.$300
4.$750
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me correct you dear that your per semester tuition fees after scholarshipis $900, rest all the details are correct. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah understood
15/11/23, 12:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University.
15/11/23, 12:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 12:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Oky have understood
15/11/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah
15/11/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah that one its clear
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah we together
15/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 782 4648: What if we fail to pay in this time
15/11/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before I attend your query, I want to highlight our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yep u can explain
15/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah clear now
15/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Ummm nop l live in Masvingo
15/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, in that case you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 782 4648: I used the account of Mr Jerera  ........is he the same mr shorwi
15/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Provide the account
15/11/23, 2:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share the details dear, you would be visiting the bank branch and depositing the fee in his account, the same details are as below:-

*Bank:* FBC
*Account Holder's Name:* Charles Jerera
*Account Number:* 5333 0380 1404 8828
*Swift Code:* FBCPZWHA
*Branch:* Masvingo
*Contact Number:* +263 77 376 9854
15/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Oky thank you
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263777824648. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanaka, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
16/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Hello am here ...
How are you
16/11/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263777824648, I am doing well thank you for asking.
16/11/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777824648 May I please know if you have taken a note of above message?
17/11/23, 12:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanaka, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I believe you had some challenges as you left the session in between, I am genuinely concerned and would appreciate it if you could share any issues or concerns that might be hindering our sessions. 

Additionally, I would like to arrange a suitable time for us to reconnect and continue our session. Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.
18/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Now am available between 1 pm and 3
18/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 782 4648: We have a challenge that we might not get that $300 within 15days
18/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern. We truly understand the challenge you're facing. To assist you better, could you provide more details about the specific challenge you anticipate that might hinder your ability to make the $300 payment within the given 15-day deadline? This information will help us better understand your situation and explore possible solutions.
20/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 229 2869: The specific challenge is we get money from rentals so my dates are 4-6 and 16 so that's where exactly l get money
20/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 229 2869: Morning hw was your weekend, my was fine
20/11/23, 2:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanaka, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for sharing your challenge with me Tanaka and rest assured that we are here to assist you with a solution as well. 

However, to ensure you have all the details regarding the letter discussion, I want us to first complete our ongoing conversation regarding your offer letter and then address any queries/challenges you may have. 

Once we have covered those details, we can get into the challenges you're facing and work together on finding the best solution. What are your thoughts on this?
21/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 782 4648: Its oky we can first discuss the offer letter
21/11/23, 11:47 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanaka, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for the confirmation @263777824648, In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
21/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Hie good evening
21/11/23, 5:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263777824648, May I please know if you are available for the session?
21/11/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah am available
21/11/23, 5:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, With this let's start our session for today please, I hope you remember our last conversation regarding EWYL. On that note, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.
21/11/23, 5:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah its clear
21/11/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/11/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Ummmm l wanted to ask that it is only guaranteed that l only get $1000  for EWYL
21/11/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, Let me share that the EWYL credits are not limited to a maximum of $1000. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 782 4648: Yeah its now clear we can move on
21/11/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
21/11/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
