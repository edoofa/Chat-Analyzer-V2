14/08/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
14/08/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Okay we can start
14/08/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 159 2250: l am done
14/08/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/08/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/08/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Yes they are clear
14/08/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/08/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Following
14/08/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/08/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 159 2250: All clear
14/08/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 159 2250: We can proceed
14/08/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/08/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/08/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
14/08/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

15/08/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 159 2250: The scholarship credits gives the feeling of independent.  To be successful one should be open minded , have a  teachable spirit, willing to go an extra mile and follow instructions.
16/08/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Good afternoon ma'am
16/08/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Okay let me do that now
16/08/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, I shall wait for your response.
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 159 2250: l have understand that a lot of time has been spend on getting good universities and the board has chosen the top 250.These universities has been chosen because they offer good practice skills, knowledge , right skills and attitude.They   also help the edoofian in the EWL program and offer good environment for the edoofian.
16/08/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding.  I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
16/08/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
16/08/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
16/08/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 159 2250: On this video the founders talked about the vision of the Edoofa family , plans and acceptions .The Edoofa  make the edoofian more employable by offering scholarship , affordable education and the credits through  EWLY

16/08/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Following
16/08/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Okay ma'am

17/08/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 159 2250: 2 Entrepreneurship can be defined as the process of creating a new business , taking on the risk and responsibility of owning and operating it as well as reaping the reward of it's success. Economic development is the process of improving the economic well being of a country. 
Enterpreneurship is often seen as a key driver of economic development as it can create new business, products and services that boost economic activity and generate jobs . Enterpreneur tend to be more risk tolerant and willing to invest in new ideas and technologies which lead to increased productivity and competitiveness which will then lead to economic development.
Economic development provides the resources and infrastructure that enterpreneurs need to succeed. As economies  develop , they become more open and innovative which can encourage entrepreneurs to take risk and start new ventures.
Without entrepreneurship , economic development would be much slower and without economic development entrepreneurship would have a much harder time getting their business off the ground
17/08/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 159 2250: 3 GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. It is a set of standards and guidelines that govern the preparation of financial statements. GAAP was established by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) which is non-governmental organisation that establishes accounting standards. The four main importance of GAAP are consistency, transparency, relevance and realiability. 

Transparency is a key principle of GAAP. It requires that companies provide clear and accurate information in their fanancial statements. This includes disclosing information about the company's financial condition and business transactions. This will help investors and other stakeholders make informed decisions about the company. It also help protect the company from potential fraud.

Relevance is another importance of GAAP. It requires that companies provide financial information that is relevant to decision makers. This means that information must be timely, accurate and complete. It should also be presented in a way that is easy to understand. For example, campanies must report on both the balance sheet and income statement rather than just one or the other. Decision makers won't be left in the dark with relevant.

Reliability is another importance of GAAP which ensures that the financial statements are prepared using generally acceptable accounting methods. These methods should be objective, verifiable and consistent. Reliable financial statements are essential for decision to have confidence in the company's financial health.It also helps to prevent the manipulation of financial statements for personal gain.

The last one is consistency. Consistent financial statements help ensure that investors can compare the performance of different companies over time. They also help to prevent manipulation of financial statements as it would be difficult to change the reporting methods without affecting the overall consistency of the statements. It also make it easier for companies to comply with other financial regulations such as those related to taxes and financial reporting
17/08/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 159 2250: 4.  Accounting Standards are the set of rules and guidelines that companies must follow when preparing their financial statements. These accounting standards are developed by the FABS and they ensure that all companies follow the same general principles when reporting their financial information.

Accounting standards are mandatory to ensure consistency in financial reporting. Consistent financial statements are important for investors and regulators. Without mandatory accounting standards companies would be free to use any reporting method they choose which can lead to confusion and difficulty in comparing companies.

Second, accounting standards are mandatory to prevent companies from manipulating their financial statements. Without mandatory statements, companies could potentially use creative accounting methods to make their financial statements appear more favorable than they actually are . This would be misleading to investors and regulators.

It is mandatory for companies to follow accounting standards as it ensures uniformity in the accounting process and also makes statements comparable with other organisations.

22/08/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Okay
22/08/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know by when will you be able to share the same?
22/08/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 159 2250: l have sent it but because of network it's taking long to download
22/08/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for it. I hope the network gets better.
22/08/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 159 2250: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
22/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
22/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors in Commerce for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
22/08/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Okay ma'am
22/08/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Yes
22/08/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
22/08/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Yes I ready
22/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
22/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
22/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Yes it's not possible
22/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
22/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
22/08/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
22/08/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Yes he did
22/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
22/08/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Understood
22/08/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
22/08/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Yes it's clear
22/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
22/08/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 159 2250: l am following ma'am
22/08/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
22/08/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 159 2250: No everything was clear
22/08/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
22/08/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 159 2250: Okay ma'am
23/08/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Chantel.

14/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 864 6190: Understood
14/10/23, 11:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
14/10/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/10/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
14/10/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
14/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 573 4638: Very excited
14/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 573 4638: Thank you very much
14/10/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Understood
14/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 573 4638: Yes you can proceed
14/10/23, 12:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 864 6190: We can proceed
14/10/23, 12:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
14/10/23, 12:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Chantel, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/10/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Wow amazing
14/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Noted
14/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes
14/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 573 4638: Yes it does we really appreciate
14/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes
14/10/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Please provide more information
14/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
14/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Thank you
14/10/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
14/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes
14/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes that's very true
14/10/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/10/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Noted
14/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
14/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Understood
14/10/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Noted
14/10/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 864 6190: No questions we can move forward
14/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
14/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes l am
14/10/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
14/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Okay ma'am thank you 
Have a blessed weekend
14/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome and than you.
17/10/23, 11:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chantel,

18/10/23, 7:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Good evening ma'am
18/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes l read the letter
18/10/23, 8:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263788646190. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 8:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Okay
18/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes we can proceed
18/10/23, 8:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 8:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 864 6190: 1. $900
2.3 years(6 semester)
3.$300
4.The registration fee is $750 ,so that the Admission Acceptance Letter will be issued ,which is going to help when acquiring the visa to India
18/10/23, 8:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling six semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Noted
18/10/23, 8:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Chantel. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. 

Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
18/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Okay
18/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 864 6190: 💯
18/10/23, 8:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Chantel. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 864 6190: We can move forward
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes
18/10/23, 9:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes
18/10/23, 9:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/10/23, 9:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes ma'am
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Chantel. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Harare Chitungwiza
18/10/23, 9:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 9:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 9:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Noted
18/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Thank you ma'am
18/10/23, 9:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/10/23, 9:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Yes ma'am
18/10/23, 9:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. If that was a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Okay
18/10/23, 10:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Chantel. Now to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur for Blessing at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
19/10/23, 5:10 am - +263 77 573 4638: Noted with thanks, Good morning ma'am.
19/10/23, 5:34 am - +263 78 864 6190: Understood
19/10/23, 5:34 am - +263 78 864 6190: Good morning ma'am
19/10/23, 9:24 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning to you as well Parents and Chantel. 

I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established Chantel's total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.
19/10/23, 9:24 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/10/23, 9:24 am - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
19/10/23, 9:24 am - Vilsha Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 864 6190: Understood
19/10/23, 8:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Chantel. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
19/10/23, 8:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
19/10/23, 8:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?

I hope you are doing well. With regards to our last conversation, I wanted to reach out to you to get an update on the discussion you had as a family regarding your scholarship offer letter and your university admission formalities for the same. As per our discussion, you were planning to make the payment of your fee today, 30th November 2023 so that you can secure your scholarship seat before the due date.

Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now?
30/11/23, 9:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263775734638 I was expecting response from your side, since we were not able to connect today hence I would like to schedule our session tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
