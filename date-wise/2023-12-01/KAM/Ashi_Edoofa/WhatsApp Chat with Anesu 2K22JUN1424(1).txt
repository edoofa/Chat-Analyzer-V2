I hope this message finds you well.

I am *Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer* at Edoofa. As we gear up for the 2023 intake, I have been diligently reviewing the applications of our prospective students. During this process, your admission file caught my attention, and I'd like to discuss a significant aspect with you.
31/08/23, 9:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: I noticed that you were previously offered a remarkable opportunity by MVN University, presenting a generous 90% scholarship on your tuition fee. However, according to your application, it appears you decided to pursue your education at PDM University. This contrast in choices has prompted me to reach out to you, as I believe this decision holds more potential than meets the eye.

I am eager to explore this further and would like to know if now is a suitable time for us to connect and have a meaningful discussion or otherwise, you can lset me know by when can we have this discussion? <This message was edited>
01/09/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 697 7701: Hello

01/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 548 6225: Yes ok
01/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 548 6225: Today
01/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 548 6225: Yes I want pdm
01/09/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your willingness to engage in this discussion. Before we get into the details, I would appreciate it if you could share the thought process that led you to choose PDM University over MVN University, especially given the attractive 90% scholarship offered by MVN. This will help me understand your thought process better and then provide you with valuable feedback that can ensure you start your career right.
01/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 548 6225: Oky  I don't  just choose  school because of 100% or what but I assess the rank of school  also

02/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: I truly value your perspective, and it's clear that PDM University holds its merits as a preferred choice. I want to assure you that your choice of PDM is entirely valid and commendable.

However, I would also like to present an alternative viewpoint. Through recent conversations with the academic board and interactions with students, MVN University has surfaced as a university with exceptional potential. Its reputation for academic excellence, combined with its commitment to holistic student development, has garnered substantial recognition.
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: For a moment, I want you to Imagine an environment where modern infrastructure, well-equipped classrooms, state-of-the-art labs, extensive libraries, comfortable hostels, and ample sports facilities converge to create an optimal learning atmosphere. MVN University takes pride in fostering an all-encompassing educational journey and hence it seems to be a better fit for you and your family.

What sets MVN apart is its unwavering dedication to innovation and nurturing students' holistic growth. This focus positions MVN as a formidable contender against any institution. While PDM University undoubtedly has its merits, MVN's comprehensive approach offers a unique blend of academic prowess and personal development.
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moreover, let's consider the financial aspect. Opting for MVN University would substantially lower your educational expenses. To put things in perspective, the annual costs at MVN are nearly half of what you would incur at PDM. This equates to obtaining a superior education, coupled with valuable cost savings, which could significantly impact your long-term financial outlook. I hope you are following?
02/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 548 6225: Oky I will discuss with my family and I will be back to you
04/09/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
04/09/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were able to have a discussion with your family about the conversation that we had on shifting your admission from PDM to MVN by now dear?
04/09/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 697 7701: Yes go ahead to mvn but please can i hqve any contact if Zimbabwean  who is going because I don't know anyone there that was my reason
05/09/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 697 7701 started a call
05/09/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/09/23, 10:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that dear. Now, when it comes to the contact number of the students, stay assured that we will help you with that once you will be ready to arrive here in India. 

Moving ahead, as you may recall that the admission fee for MVN University is $1000 and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. Can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
05/09/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 697 7701: Oky i will let you and also when are students going
05/09/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 697 7701: Maybe tomorrow. But can you see this year is expensive at mvn than pdm
05/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know by when shall I expect a response from your side on that so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
05/09/23, 12:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please that is not true. Only the admission fee at MVN is a bit higher than PDM, other than that, the expenses for the rest of the year are very low.
05/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 697 7701: Oky expalain more the mvn letter
05/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 697 7701: Tomorrow
05/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 697 7701: Ok am tired of waiting
05/09/23, 12:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Once you are done with making the payment please share the receipt with me here so that we can confirm the same from the side of the accounts team.
05/09/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 697 7701: Ok
05/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 697 7701: <Media omitted>
05/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 697 7701: Respond ne please
05/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, once this $250 is paid, then the balance fee that would remain is $850 for the first year, and that will be required to be cleared once Anesu will arrive here in India. 

Moving forward, if you are planning to make the payment through Mr. Charles, then you can move ahead to make the payment to his FBC Bank on the below-mentioned details:

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828

I hope you are doing well. May I know what have you decided regarding your tickets?
12/09/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 697 7701: Im departing from Zimbabwe tomorrow
12/09/23, 10:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263776977701
12/09/23, 10:04 am - Ashi Edoofa: As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 14th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
12/09/23, 10:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
12/09/23, 10:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Anesu 2K22JUN1424*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
12/09/23, 10:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us. Remember to bring the physical form with you to India and submit it when you meet the Edoofa Officials. In case you have not yet filled out the form, please ensure to do so today.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion about the possibility of changing your course from BA LLB to BBA LLB. After conducting several discussions with Mr. Devesh and the college authorities, I regret to inform you that it has been determined that such a change is not possible at this time.

The decision not to allow this course change is based on the college's authority policies and regulations. Specifically, the college has decided not to offer international seats for the BBA LLB program, and this decision is not subject to change at the moment.

I understand that this may be difficult to take, and I want to assure you that we explored all available options before arriving at this conclusion. Please know that we are here to support you in any way we can within the constraints of the college's policies.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We are committed to helping you navigate your academic journey and ensuring your success at our institution.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

Mr.Mukund
