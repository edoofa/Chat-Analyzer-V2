04/08/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from MVN University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
04/08/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 547 4582: Yes l managed to go through it. Yes we may discuss it
04/08/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
04/08/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? 
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
04/08/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 547 4582: 1.$350
2.$0
04/08/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, Carry on, dear.
04/08/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 547 4582: 3.$1300
4.$125
5.$1000
04/08/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
04/08/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 547 4582: Quite affordable
04/08/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes. Indeed. Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
04/08/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 547 4582: So thus a total of $1600 per annum
04/08/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
04/08/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 547 4582: Very clear noted
04/08/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
04/08/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 547 4582: May you explain EDB and Book Bank.
04/08/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 547 4582: How about food?
04/08/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: EDB: EDB stands for "Educational Development Bank." It is an institution or a financial organization that provides loans, financial aid, or grants specifically for educational purposes. Educational Development Banks aim to support students, educational institutions, and educational projects by offering favorable loan terms or financial assistance for various educational needs, such as tuition fees, study materials, research projects, and infrastructure development.
04/08/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Book Bank: A Book Bank is a library-like facility or service provided by educational institutions to support their students' academic needs. The Book Bank typically contains a collection of textbooks and reference materials that students can borrow for a specific period. It is intended to assist students who may not be able to afford all the required textbooks or study materials. By borrowing books from the Book Bank, students can have access to essential reading materials without the financial burden of purchasing them outright.
04/08/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please.
04/08/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 547 4582: OK noted
04/08/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
04/08/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
04/08/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 547 4582: All clear
04/08/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600 and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
04/08/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 547 4582: Yes sir understood
04/08/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed. Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850- $1000 = $850.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
04/08/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 547 4582: OK noted. May l ask on the admission and processing fee of $1000. Since l had paid some money on seat reservation is it deducted from this $1000.
04/08/23, 10:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I shall come to that as well.
04/08/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 547 4582: Thank you so much
04/08/23, 10:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to secure your scholarship seat with MVN University, a fee of $1000 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the Gulzar Group of institutions the total of $750 that you paid for your fee atGulzar Group of institutions will be adjusted against the registration fee at MVN University and hence you would have to pay the difference in fee which becomes $1000 - $750 = $250.

If you decide to change your university and transfer your admission to MVN University, you will have to make a payment of $250 before the 10th of August. I hope this clarifies the information for you?
04/08/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 547 4582: Everything is clear now

04/08/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would encourage you to take some time and have a healthy discussion with your family regarding your offer letter from MVN University. I am sure they must be excited to know about the same.

04/08/23, 10:36 pm - +263 77 547 4582: OK noted thank you so much
05/08/23, 10:23 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you would be able to share the name of the university?
05/08/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 547 4582: Yes sir, we opted for GGI
05/08/23, 10:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know your inclination towards GGI as you have been offered a higher amount of scholarship from MVN university, dear?
05/08/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 547 4582: MVN total fee per annum is more than GGI
05/08/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with the break up of the two universities. 

Gulzar Group of Institutions

1. Tuition Fee Per Year - $1200
2. Hostel and Mess/Food Fees - $1250

Now, when you add up both of these components, your per annum cost of education that is due to the university becomes $1200+ $1250 = $2450

MVN University

Annual Fee = $1600
Sports Fee = $125
Misc Fee = $125 (one time)
Registration fee = $1000 (one time)

Now, when you add up both of these components, your first-year cost of education that is due to the university becomes $2850 but from your second year it would be $1725
05/08/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, based on the above details may I know if I were able to clear your doubts?
05/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 547 4582: Yes all clear now
05/08/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would like you to consider your choice on the university of your choice, dear.
05/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 547 4582: May l give you the feedback by evening today

07/08/23, 6:23 am - +263 77 547 4582: And what is the budget for off campus accommodation at GGI.
07/08/23, 8:33 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good morning, beloved parents and Takudzwa. I hope this message reaches you in good health and high spirits. I had a fantastic weekend, and I appreciate your kind inquiry. Now, regarding the matter at hand, I'd like to inform you that the Gulzar Group of Institutions has a policy in place where all students are required to reside on campus during their first year. After completing this initial period, they are allowed to shift to off-campus accommodations, my dear.
07/08/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 547 4582: OK noted with concern
07/08/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 547 4582: Is the same also with meals
07/08/23, 9:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your meals are included in the hostel package as well. If you wish to have a snack or a quick bite outside of the campus you can do that as well but that will come under personal expenses. I hope I am clear.
07/08/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 547 4582: OK noted
07/08/23, 11:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now regarding the finalization of the university. May I know which university are you more inclined towards, dear?
