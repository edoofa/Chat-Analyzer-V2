23/10/23, 8:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
23/10/23, 8:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
23/10/23, 8:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
23/10/23, 9:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
23/10/23, 9:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
23/10/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 706 3727: I'm following
23/10/23, 9:04 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
23/10/23, 9:04 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $750.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
23/10/23, 9:04 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
23/10/23, 9:04 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?

23/10/23, 9:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/10/23, 9:16 am - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

25/10/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 706 3727: I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that I had an exam today
25/10/23, 6:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Understood @263787063727, no worries. How was your exam?
25/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 706 3727: It was fair
25/10/23, 6:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know @263787063727. May I know if you have completed the above task?

01/11/23, 11:32 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Paidamoyo, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I believe you had some challenges as you left the session in between, I am genuinely concerned and would appreciate it if you could share any issues or concerns that might be hindering our sessions. 

Additionally, I would like to arrange a suitable time for us to reconnect and continue our session. Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.
01/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 706 3727: I will be available at 1 o'clock
01/11/23, 11:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your availability with us dear, Looking forward to reconnect with you at 1:00pm.
01/11/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263787063727, May I know if we can start our session?
01/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 706 3727: We can start
01/11/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263787063727. As you must be aware that, When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
01/11/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
01/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Yes
01/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right
01/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Yes
01/11/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
01/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Yeah
01/11/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
01/11/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/11/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok
01/11/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok
01/11/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
01/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 706 3727: So the bachelor degree will still be completed in 5 years
01/11/23, 1:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263787063727 duration of bachelor's degree is based on the program duration. <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 1:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
01/11/23, 1:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
01/11/23, 1:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 706 3727: There is refund only when I fail to get offer letter and when I fail to get a minimum of 2 points right?
01/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, I hope you have a more clarity now.
01/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok
01/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
01/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Yes I'm really excited
01/11/23, 2:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to her chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
01/11/23, 2:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
01/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok thank you
01/11/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Have a good day ahead!
14/11/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Paidamoyo,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 8:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

14/11/23, 8:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 12:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Paidamoyo, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

With respect to the above message, I hope you had a chance to go through my message. Kindly share your response dear, I hope you are excited for this good news.
15/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Good day
15/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 706 3727: I do not understand where the $750 I'm to pay for admission is coming from
15/11/23, 12:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263787063727 As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok
15/11/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 706 3727: 1.900
2.5 years
3.300
4.
15/11/23, 1:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses, May I know if there's any challenge with respect to the registration fees, Have you been able to find the amount?
15/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 706 3727: I couldn't
15/11/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Let me help you in that your registration fees is $750 according to your offer letter. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263787063727 May I know if we are still connected dear?
15/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok
15/11/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok
15/11/23, 5:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok
15/11/23, 5:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 706 3727: But it seems as if the financial expenses are rising every time there is a conversation
15/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Yes
15/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263787063727 We will help you in understanding the finances, kindly don't worry dear.
15/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok thanks
15/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok
15/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 706 3727: But I don't think if I will make it
15/11/23, 5:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 706 3727: You may explain
15/11/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok
15/11/23, 5:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 5:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 78 706 3727: I'm in Harare
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Paidamoyo, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
17/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Good day
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263787063727, How have you been?

Are you ready for the session dear?
17/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Yes
17/11/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, As we were discussing regarding the payment modes. Let me share Mr. Rajan contact no. with you.
17/11/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 706 3727: May I ask. At first you said the scholarship will cover accommodation but now you are saying I should pay 2000 for accommodation
17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct Paidamoyo. The accommodation is a part of the per annum cost shared with you after the scholarship. 

I am sure you recall that the per annum cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000. However, with the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, which effectively reduces your cost of education to just $2000 to $3000 per year which not only includes your tuition fee but also your accommodation fee, cost of food and other basic expenses such as 24/7 wifi, electricity and water bills.
17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800
17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This brings your per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800 and if you see, this amount of $2800 falls within the range that was shared with you early on. I hope with this above break up, the query you had has been addressed and now you have a better perspective?
17/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 706 3727: Ok
17/11/23, 4:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
