31/07/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 494 9271: We will do a thorough assessment of all three universities,together with your assistance, of course, to help us make an informed final decision
31/07/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 494 9271: We had a nice one thank you
31/07/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, for that. Shall we continue with the discussion?
31/07/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 494 9271: Yea we can
31/07/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I shall start with the discussion of LPU offer letter.
31/07/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 494 9271: Okay
31/07/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with the off-campus accommodation = $3825.
31/07/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with the off-campus accommodation = $3150.
31/07/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you prefer more affordable accommodation and don't want to stay on campus, you can choose off-campus accommodation. The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.
31/07/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure your scholarship seat with Lovely Professional University, a registration fee of $700 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar, $750 of that amount will be adjusted against the registration fee and the remaining tuition fee for the first year. If you choose to change your university, you can transfer your admission without any additional payment. I hope this clarifies the information for you?
31/07/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 494 9271: Kindly give us a few minutes to go through what you have sent

Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.

Greetings

Hope you're doing well, This is *Mr.Mukund*, _Division of Student Welfare_
Please make sure to share your *Edoofa Undertaking/Declaration Form* today.
20/09/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 494 9271: Is this for student?
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - +91 93546 23922: yes this is for Rufaro
20/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 494 9271: Okay
20/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 494 9271: Did you manage to verify with the Accounts Department about that $425 payment
20/09/23, 2:38 pm - Rithvik Edoofa joined using this group's invite link
20/09/23, 2:43 pm - +91 93546 23922: Greetings Parents
The amount that was paid by you is $425 after which 11% transaction charged were there ended up being $383
therefore the payment due is $42
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 494 9271: We made a payment of $447 altogether ,so that the cash collected can be $425
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 494 9271: We weren't told anything about 11% you are telling us now
20/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 494 9271: We paid the cost for the funds to be received $425 as cash,paying another 11% is not making sense to us.
Kindly help us get clarity there
20/09/23, 3:46 pm - +91 93546 23922: Dear Parents,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to clarify financial transaction that you made. It has come to our attention that there may be some confusion regarding the charges associated with a transaction from Zimbabwe to India.

First and foremost, I want to assure you that we take great care in managing our financial processes, especially when it comes to transactions involving your hard-earned money. We understand that transparency and clear communication are essential in maintaining your trust.

The 11% cost you see on your statement is specifically related to the transaction from Zimbabwe to India. This fee is imposed by the financial institutions and intermediaries involved in international money transfers. It is not a fee that we have control over, but rather a standard cost associated with cross-border transactions.

The other cost you might have observed was for Mukuru transactions. Mukuru is our default and trusted payment procedure for various transactions. This includes sending funds securely, managing payments, and ensuring that all financial interactions between our students and the school are handled efficiently.

Please rest assured that we are committed to maintaining the highest level of transparency and accountability when it comes to financial matters. If you have any further questions or concerns regarding these transactions or any other financial aspect of our school, please do not hesitate to reach out to our finance department.

Thank you for your continued trust in our institution. We greatly appreciate your support in providing the best possible education for your child.
20/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 494 9271: Well noted,however, if you take time to note that we have paid most if not all  our payments via PayPal because of the low cost involved.
Is there any alternative way to send besides Mukuru because it seem to be very costly
20/09/23, 3:51 pm - +91 93546 23922: i understand your concern Ma'am but at the moment this is the most economical available source of transactions <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 494 9271: And PayPal ,Mastercard or Visa is no longer acceptable?
20/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 494 9271: Only Mukuru can do?
20/09/23, 3:53 pm - +91 93546 23922: I will let you know about this
20/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 494 9271: Thank you
20/09/23, 3:55 pm - +91 93546 23922: yes, you can pay through Paypal which has a transaction cost for 10%
20/09/23, 3:56 pm - +91 93546 23922: You can directly pay through the website of Edoofa
20/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 494 9271: While we at it ,we are appealing for a special request to have that $42 balance  debited to our next invoice of the final installment of $425
20/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 494 9271: This is to minimize cost of sending a small amount
20/09/23, 3:57 pm - +91 93546 23922: https://www.edoofa.com/

Use this link and navigate to the payment button on the website, it would open a form. Enter the amount to be paid you want to pay, and add the contact and card details, the payment would be made directly to India with this process.
20/09/23, 3:57 pm - +91 93546 23922: i totally understand but to cleat the dues by 30th september of atleast half the fees is mandatory
20/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 494 9271: We tried this and failed before we opted for the Mukuru option
20/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 494 9271: You mean the $42 balance has to be paid by 30 September?
20/09/23, 3:59 pm - +91 93546 23922: Alright incase you want we can get you an invoice made <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 3:59 pm - +91 93546 23922: yes
20/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 494 9271: We will request invoice before the 30th
20/09/23, 4:03 pm - +91 93546 23922: Alright thanks for sharing the update

25/09/23, 9:13 am - +91 93546 23922: not an issue, this would just take a little time, let me ask them to process it for you!
25/09/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 494 9271: No problem
25/09/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 494 9271: Thank you
