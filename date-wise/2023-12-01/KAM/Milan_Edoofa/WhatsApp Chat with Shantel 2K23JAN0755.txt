31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Shantel!
I hope this message finds you in good health.

I am Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer at Edoofa. Currently, I am diligently reviewing the application files of students who are preparing to join us for the 2023 intake in India. During this process, I noticed that you have plans to commence your studies at PDM University.
31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: As we eagerly await the arrival date confirmation from PDM University, I wanted to mention that we recently engaged in a conversation to finalize the details, and the university has indicated that they will be providing us with an update within this week.

Given the time at hand, I would like to seize this opportunity to discuss a potential option with you that could potentially enhance both the affordability and enrichment of your higher education experience in India. Would now be a suitable time for us to engage in this discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion?
31/08/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 237 9529: Good evening now is okay we can discuss
31/08/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to learn that you are open to discussing this matter. Before we get into the specifics, I wanted to share a recent development that could significantly influence your educational journey.

Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university here in India. This collaboration has prompted the academic board to revisit scholarship opportunities for a select group of students, including yourself, with the intention of providing a more enhanced educational pathway.

Under this new collaboration, the university is offering more substantial scholarship opportunities for the course related to your field of study, particularly in the field of Medical Laboratory Technology.
31/08/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Through this unique opportunity, you are in a position to secure a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fee, along with a 100% sponsorship for your accommodation expenses. What's particularly striking is the potential to significantly alleviate the financial burdens tied to education. This could effectively bring down your annual expenses to just $1600, encompassing all essential aspects of your education and residence.

I am eager to hear your initial thoughts on this matter. Would you be interested in exploring this specialized course further and getting into the finer details of how this opportunity could potentially transform your educational journey?
31/08/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 468 5131: Yes Sir tell me more about the opportunity
31/08/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know that you are ready to know more about the opportunity. Moving ahead, after thorough reconsideration of your application as well as a proper analysis of your documents, the academic board has suggested that you should pursue the course B.Sc. MLT for your higher education here in India for the given opportunity since it would help you in having a better career in the future as well as you would also be able to make your higher education even more affordable. I hope you understand?
31/08/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 468 5131: Yes understood

04/09/23, 11:00 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 237 9529: Mrng noted with thanks
04/09/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 237 9529: So what happens to the deposit we paid to Pdm
04/09/23, 11:18 am - Milan Edoofa: We will discuss that further during our conversation dear. Now, before that, I would require you to go through the letter once in detail. Once you are done with that, please let me know.
04/09/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 237 9529: So the annual fee is 1600. The start date is written 1st of Aug does that mean they have already started there semester.
04/09/23, 11:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding this query of yours, I would like to mention that the dates that are mentioned on the offer letter are tentative dates for the start of this year's intake, which means that the intake would not start exactly at that time. 

On the same note, I would like to mention that MVN University has already released their date of travel and that is in the month of September, specifically within the second-third week. I hope this is clear with you?
04/09/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 468 5131: What date is the arrival date?
04/09/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 237 9529: I am done with the letter
04/09/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 237 9529: Its clear
04/09/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: We will discuss that further when we would have completed the admission process please.
04/09/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
04/09/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? 
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
04/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 237 9529: 1) 1600usd
2) 0
3)1600
4)125
5) 1000
04/09/23, 3:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Shantel, please go through the letter once again and let me know of the point number one correctly dear.
04/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 237 9529: 1) 350
04/09/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
04/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 468 5131: Yes
Accommodation does it also include food?
04/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to Accommodation, then it is sponsored by the university for the whole duration of the course. 

Regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please.
04/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 237 9529: At the hostel do they save African food or its Indian only.
04/09/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the university's hostel, the main cuisine served is Indian. However, for students who prefer other types of food, especially African cuisine, they have the option to cook their own meals as per their preference so they will have the flexibility to cook African dishes or any other cuisine they prefer during their stay. I hope this is clear? <This message was edited>
04/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 468 5131: Very clear Sir
04/09/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
04/09/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
04/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 237 9529: Its clear sir
04/09/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
04/09/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 237 9529: Can yu pliz explain no.5 what is it at first when i saw bk bank i though its library fee 😅😅
04/09/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Shantel. Now, for the whole duration of your course, you will indeed have access to the Library, however, apart from that, all the books that are advised to be mandatorily included in your course curriculum will be dedicatedly provided to you for personal use during the entire course and it will change in every semester that you will pass. 

Hence, it will ensure that you will have a peace of mind when it comes to the books that you will need to study and that you won't have to spend any extra on them as well. I hope this is now clear?
04/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 237 9529: Its clear sir
04/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 237 9529: Its Shantel's mother lets talk about the deposit we hve understood all yu have explained pertaining the letter. Thank yu very much
04/09/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, moving ahead, as you can see the admission fee for MVN University is $1000, and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. Can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
04/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 237 9529: It can be paid any i dont know if we can use aVisa card to pay or yu can tell us what to do.
04/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 237 9529: Cant they accept that 750 since she is coming soon she will bring the bal that way its cheaper and easier to us.
04/09/23, 4:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I totally understand the same, however, in order for us to be able to move ahead with the next steps in your admission process and get your VISA done, we would have to complete your admission process.
04/09/23, 4:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to making the payment, I believe you had made the payment of the $750 through Mr. Rajan in cash, may I know if you would be able to do that again?
04/09/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 237 9529: Its alright we can give him. Lets hope all goes well this time cause we are tired of waiting all the students  hre  have gone to skul she is the only one left

05/09/23, 9:18 am - Milan Edoofa: While making the payment to Mr. Rajan, you would have to pay it along with the 7% transfer charges, i.e. 7% of the $250 please.

Dear Parents and Guardians,

We hope this message finds you well. We have made several attempts to remind you about the outstanding tuition fees of *$25* 

This message serves as an official warning from the university administration. Failing to settle the outstanding tuition fees will have severe consequences for your child's academic progress. We understand that financial situations can be challenging, and we are committed to assisting you in any way we can. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 10:57 am - +91 93546 23922: Consequences of not paying fee is *Academic Loss* Students with unpaid fees may not be allowed to attend classes, which will directly impact their education. This absence may result in missing crucial lectures, assignments, and exams. Attendance records would therefore be affected and hence Consistent absences due to unpaid fees can lead to a significant drop in attendance, potentially preventing your child to take up exams and therefore backlogs. Accumulating backlogs can result in additional academic challenges and the imposition of high penalty charges.

We genuinely care about your child's education and well-being, and we want to ensure they have every opportunity to succeed. Therefore, we are issuing this warning in advance to prevent any confusion and to allow you ample time to address the outstanding tuition fees.

Our primary goal is to support your child's academic journey and ensure they receive the education they deserve. Your cooperation is crucial in this regard, and we trust that you will take this warning seriously.

11/10/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 237 9529: But on our side its not fair yu are harrassing us for such a small amount yu shld understand us we are your parents.
