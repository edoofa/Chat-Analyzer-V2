He's a good counsellor and he made my understanding about Edoofa easier to both me and my parents  I actually learnt a lot from him and also I would like to sincerely express my gratitude to all of the Edoofa board I've connected with so far they have made it easier to enroll and mostly importantly discard the idea of letting the opportunity pass by thinking it is a scam. Thank you.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/08/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay we can start the discussion
04/08/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I am done
04/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
04/08/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes they are very clear
04/08/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/08/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I am following
04/08/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
04/08/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
04/08/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay maam I understand but I would like to inquire about the registration fee . The $500 - 750 ..is it covered by the scholarship or the enrolled student?
04/08/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263714628444 please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
04/08/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay it is clear ..we can move ahead
04/08/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
04/08/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes we can
04/08/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
04/08/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
04/08/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
04/08/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

04/08/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
04/08/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 462 8444: 5 :00 PM CAT
04/08/23, 4:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263714628444 , I am sure, you are aware of our discussion hours since they were informed to you clearly at the start of your admission Process, hence connecting with you at 05.00 PM CAT, will not be possible for me.
04/08/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay please let's connect at 4:30 PM CAT
04/08/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please, note that our available hours are from 12.00 pm to 04.00 pm CAT only and our discussion hours are from 07.30 pm to 11.00 pm CAT so the time you suggested will not be suitable for me to connect.
04/08/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay we can connect again at 7:00PM CAT because network is a bit of challenge right now
04/08/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 07.30 PM CAT. I hope you will be able to go through the videos by that time.
04/08/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 329 9952: Alright thank you
04/08/23, 7:02 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Good evening
04/08/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263714628444, I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
04/08/23, 7:27 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I am available
04/08/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, so may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
04/08/23, 7:29 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I have gone through all the videos and I must say I am impressed and motivated
04/08/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so could you please share your understanding of the videos?
04/08/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 462 8444: My understanding of the videos in brief is mostly the emphasis on following instructions all in all so that one can be accepted into the institutions under Edoofa . I understand that Edoofa aims to create successful students who are employable , confident and who do not fear to go an extra mile for success . 
Moreso the video about universities  and colleges under Edoofa emphasises on time taken to consider suitable, friendly and fully qualified environments which accommodate favourably all students internationally . The education offered also in this institutions under Edoofa not only exposes one to higher education but also but gives the student part time work under the Earn While You Learn Program where one is equipped with knowledge of the employers requirements which is an advantage in being a student who will be more advantageous in getting a job thus the vision of making employable students . I also leant of the reasons why students are given projects in community building. It is to introduce a mindset of giving back to the community and interactingwith the community by serving it . 
I also got enlightened about the SOP that it is an important document reflecting a version of who you are and serves to be convincing as to why you should be chosen , where you are outstanding and why you deserve to be chosen


That was my understanding of the 4 videos in brief
04/08/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
04/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
04/08/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes thank you
04/08/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
04/08/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay
04/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Monday at 09.00 pm.
04/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
04/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
04/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. O-Level Results*

*2. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
04/08/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I'm sorry can I please ask about the course I will be doing I saw the interview questions for sociology but I ended up opting for Hotel Management and Catering Technology ? So can I please ask if i will do interview questions for both courses

10/08/23, 8:46 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Qsn 2) What is Hospitality in the Hotel Industry? 

Hospitality in the hotel industry refer to the services, facilities and amenities that a hotel provides to its guests in order to create a positive, welcoming and comfortable experience . It is not just about providing a place to sleep rather more about creating an experience that make guests feel at home .

In a hotel , hospitality is paramount as it directly impacts guest satisfaction and loyalty . Thus it involves creating an inviting atmosphere that put guests at ease and makes them feel valued and appreciated hence the staff is expected to be friendly and attentive to guests preferences.  Greeting of guests also has to do with hospitality in the industry hence the staff is supposed to greet with warmth and genuine interest, listen actively to requests and go above and beyond to exceed their expectations . 

Therefore hospitality refer to the provision of welcoming and professional services to guests with the aim of ensuring a comfortable and satisfactory stay. Thus includes various aspects like accommodation, food and beverage housekeeping, concierge and front desk services amongst others that cater for the guest needs and preferences. All in all the profound goal is to create a positive impact that leads to repeat service and word-of- mouth recommendation .
10/08/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Qsn 3) What is a Continuously Rendered Service? Please explain with an example. 


A Continuously Rendered Service in line with the hospitality industry is a service provided to guests throughout their entire stay rather than a sporadic service . The service requires ongoing attention and mantainance often by multiple staff members ensuring that the guest's expectations and needs are met. 
 
One most common example  of such service in hotel management is housekeeping . This service is essential in maintaining a clean and comfortable environment for the guestswhilst creating an inviting atmosphere at the same time . The housekeeping services are provided on a daily basis whereas housekeeping staff responsibly partake tasks such as making beds, vacuuming , replenishing towels , airfreshening and cleaning bathrooms all the time hence the task is continuous throughout the guest's stay in the hotel. Housekeeping services also extend beyond individual guest rooms as common areas like hallways and lobbies should also be kept tidy in order to impact the guest's expectations. The service is provided throughout the stay rather than when the guests check in or check out hence its a Continuously Rendered Service.
10/08/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Qsn 4) How do you see your country's development and in what ways can you contribute to its development process through the career you want to build in Hotel Management ? 


I see immense potential for the growth and development of my country in the hospitality industry.  The hospitality sector is one of the fastest-growing industries globally and my country possess a rich cultural natural heritage appealing to tourists . Hence I see my country's development as an ongoing process that requires collaboration and innovation. 

In terms of how I can contribute to this development , I believe by providing exceptional service and creating unique experiences for guests , in which I implement practices that promote local cultures, traditions and high quality service to guests . 

Moreover, I aspire to create employment opportunities by promoting entrepreneurship among local communities by encouraging the establishment of small businesses like affordable guesthouses, homestays and restaurants in rural areas . I believe we can distribute the benefits of the hospitality industry more broadly across society to help reduce poverty and inequality.  

Additionally, I plan to work on enhancing the quality of hospitality services by introducing new technologies, innovative marketing strategies and creative menu offering showcasing the diversity of our country's cuisine. 

I plan to contribute by implementing eco-friendly initiatives such as waste reduction programs in hotels and catering establishments , hence minimizing our carbon footprint.  Therefore in these avenues I believe to contribute significantly.
10/08/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Qsn 5) Can you explain about the concierge services related to the hospitality and tourism industry and its scope in the future 


Concierge services in the hospitality and tourism industry refer to the personalised assistance typically found in hotels or resorts. The concierge acts as a knowledgeable resource helping guests with various information services such as arranging transportation , providing details about local attractions , events , cultural  activities and navigating language barriers . The services extend to reservations where guests are helped in making reservations for restaurants , tours or spa treatments and even special events planning.  Hence concierges act as the face of the hotel, providing guests with individualized attention and ensuring that every aspects of their stay runs smoothly.  

The future scope for the concierge services is expected to grow as travellers increasingly seek out unique and customised experiences . However with the dominance of technology recently, the concierge services are likely  to shift towards digital concierge services through mobile apps or in-room tablets allowing guests to get recommendations conveniently.  Moreover with the advancement of virtual assistances and chatbots, virtual concierge services are emerging and they are promising to completely take over in future . Nevertheless , human touch and personalised service of physical concierge will still be in demand

14/08/23, 8:41 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay that is fine thank you

14/08/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are absolutely correct @263714628444, thank you.
16/08/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sharon.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your O-level results, may I know by when will you be able to share your identity proof?
16/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 462 8444: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
16/08/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
16/08/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelors of Science, in Hotel Management and Catering Technology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
16/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes we are on the same page
16/08/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
16/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 462 8444: This message was deleted
16/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 462 8444: That is great to know i am indeed ready for the third step
16/08/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
16/08/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
16/08/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I agree 
Can I ask a question about the offer lettera
16/08/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please go ahead and ask your query?
16/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I wanted to ask if the offer letters will be sent via email ..apparently my email account has been blocked due to unknown reasons hence I was asking if it's not convenient to receive all scholarship emails via my mother's email account or should I give you my new account
16/08/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand, it is completely alright, the offer letter will be shared to the same email account which you used to fill out the student application form, may I know if that was your email or your mother's email account?
16/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I used this link to fill out the form
16/08/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please the email id used to fill this form was this "SharonChivengwa26@gmail.com". So the offer letter would be shared here, also please do not worry, since we will also be receiving your offer letter so we can share the same through this platform also. I hope we are clear here?
16/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes we are
 Thank you that's a relief
16/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
16/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
16/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
16/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes he did
16/08/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
16/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Clearly understood
16/08/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
16/08/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 462 8444: That is clear but as for the registration fee...is there no payment plan or anything in paying the fee
16/08/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263714628444  please noted this is just an explanation of the cost breakdown for your better understanding, since your year of intake is 2024, your registration process shall start after August 2023, and everything will be explained in detail to you. So I would encourage you to be patient, please. 

Now, if we are clear shall we move ahead?
16/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay 
We can move forward
16/08/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
16/08/23, 7:27 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Following
16/08/23, 7:28 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Good evening
16/08/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
16/08/23, 7:34 pm - +263 71 462 8444: No , non so far l clearly understood
16/08/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
16/08/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay maam thank you
16/08/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
17/08/23, 11:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: "Good morning Parents and Sharon.

19/09/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Sharon,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 02.30 P.M. I hope this time works for you and we shall address your query tomorrow as well. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Good evening

And that's so nice of you to share the experience .
19/09/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words.
25/09/23, 6:50 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Good evening
25/09/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Sharon.

I hope you are doing well, and had a great weekend since it was the weekend, so we were not able to connect so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/09/23, 7:34 pm - +263 71 462 8444: We are all doing well , I would like to believe it is the same case with you and your family
25/09/23, 7:34 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes we can connect
25/09/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 7:39 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I do remember but I still  appreciate the reminder
25/09/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
25/09/23, 7:44 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I understand that upon receiving the offer letter and you would have accepted a particular university..a registration fee ranging from 500 to 750 is required to be paid so as to secure a sit . The registration fee becomes part of the fees for an edoofian hence fees reduction
25/09/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
25/09/23, 8:08 pm - +263 71 462 8444: When will I start receiving offer letters
25/09/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I would also like to inquire what happens in a case whereby we cannot raise the registration fee on time ?
25/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 462 8444: You had also said you will reply these 2 questions in our next session which is now
25/09/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263714628444 thank you for sharing your concern, may I know why do think that you will not be able to raise the registration fee?
25/09/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 462 8444: The financials would not have permitted given I am still in high school and fees is required and my parents do not get paid as much money as 750 USD monthly
25/09/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that @263714628444 however, in such cases, we have discussion with the Academic Board.
25/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay I understand thank you for clarifying that
25/09/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please let me answer your queries, for your first query, yes you can practice and put into use your Hotel Management degree in India, and as for your second query, it is possible however, there might be some terms and conditions as per the government.
25/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay Ms Kirti I sincerely appreciate your help in aiding my better understanding
25/09/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now shall we move ahead with our discussion?
25/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes we can Ms Kirti
25/09/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/09/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
25/09/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
25/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I am as excited to know such and I am really looking forward to it 
I also want to express my sincere gratitude
25/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
25/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
25/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 71 462 8444: It seems to be an Interesting and accommodative program
25/09/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/09/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
27/09/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 462 8444: That is clear Ms Kirti thank you
27/09/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Greetings I hope I find you well
30/09/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sharon.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
02/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Greetings
I hope I find you all well
05/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sharon.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Greetings 
It is unfortunate we wish you a speedy recovery Ms Kirti
05/10/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your warm wishes. I really appreciate that.
05/10/23, 7:14 pm - +263 71 462 8444: You are welcome 😇
05/10/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with our discussion?
05/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I can connect
05/10/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. May I know if you are clear so far?
05/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Please elaborate
05/10/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me help you understand again.

1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Sharon, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay I understand
05/10/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes it does thank you
05/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/10/23, 10:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Sharon.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are facing any challenges, since I noticed that you were able to go through my message? <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 462 8444: Yes it does resonate
07/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 462 8444: Will I be given the opportunity to choose from a number of issued universities by Edoofa or its just one university
07/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 462 8444: Yes we are currently available <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 10:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you explain, we shall share your application with multiple universities, and those who accept your application shall share you an offer letter and we will assist you in choosing the best university as per your preference please. 

I hope we are clear here?
07/10/23, 10:59 am - +263 71 462 8444: Yes we are clear thank you
07/10/23, 11:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
07/10/23, 11:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
07/10/23, 11:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
07/10/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 462 8444: What happens if you still fail to raise the first 300
07/10/23, 11:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: May I know why is that you think that you will fail to raise the first $300
07/10/23, 11:08 am - +263 71 462 8444: This is my final term at school hence we have to clear all the school fees and any other arrears in order to collect results
07/10/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that Sharon, however, I am sure your Parents are working really hard so that they can fulfill your dreams, so we should look at the positive side of it, right?
07/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I believe so
07/10/23, 11:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/10/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 462 8444: I would like you to provide more information please
07/10/23, 11:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 11:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 11:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/10/23, 11:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
07/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 462 8444: Okay I understand
07/10/23, 11:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 462 8444: Right
07/10/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
07/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Okay
07/10/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/10/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes we are
07/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
07/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Following
07/10/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
07/10/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I understand all benefits
07/10/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/10/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 462 8444: No I will let you know if any query arise
07/10/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
07/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773299952 @263714628444 may I know if we are still connected?
07/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I apologize for the disconnection 
We can still continue if it is not convenient
09/10/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Sharon.

I hope you are doing well by the time you responded it was past our available working hours so we were not able to get back to you may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
09/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Noted Ms Kirti thank you

16/10/23, 2:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am fine too please. Now, Sharon, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now?
16/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Waiting for this message
16/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Waiting for this message
16/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, we will discuss about all the queries that you have for now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
16/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Waiting for this message
16/10/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across four years. This academic journey is divided into 8 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
16/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Waiting for this message
16/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
16/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Waiting for this message
17/10/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
19/10/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharon!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 7:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Good afternoon how are you today
19/10/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Sharon!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
20/10/23, 8:28 am - +263 71 462 8444: Good morning 
Sincere apologies for not connecting yesterday there was not electricity and my phone was not charged
20/10/23, 8:28 am - +263 71 462 8444: However today we will be available the whole day we can have an uninterrupted session
20/10/23, 12:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, before we move ahead, if I may ask are you clear till here?
20/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I am clear thank you
20/10/23, 12:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/10/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes
20/10/23, 12:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I am clear with that
20/10/23, 12:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
20/10/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Can you please elaborate more on the 2 registration fees
20/10/23, 12:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Of course, I'd be happy to clarify the registration fees for you. The two registration fees mentioned in the offer letter are as follows:

*Admission and Procedure Fee*: This is a one-time fee of $300. It's a standard fee that universities often charge when students are admitted. However, in your case, this fee has been waived due to the Early Registration Scheme, which is great news. So, you don't need to worry about paying this fee.

*Registration Fee*: This is the fee that is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat at Galgotias University. It amounts to $750, and you'll need to pay this fee to secure your spot in the university.

I hope you are clear till here, right? <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Very clear
20/10/23, 12:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/10/23, 12:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
20/10/23, 12:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 462 8444: We are definitely on the same page
20/10/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 462 8444: No I reside in Bulawayo
20/10/23, 12:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 12:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 12:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Very well thank you
20/10/23, 12:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 12:26 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes please
20/10/23, 12:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Thank you
20/10/23, 12:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I understand
20/10/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/10/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes
20/10/23, 12:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/10/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Yes
20/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 462 8444: However I was researching for the course offered by the university ...Bachelor in Hotel Management....I applied for Hotel management and Catering Technology course hence I researched and there's a difference between the two courses ....what can I do?
20/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate your diligence in researching the course offerings. It's understandable to want to ensure that you're enrolling in the right program. I'm here to clarify your concerns.

While you applied for the "Hotel Management and Catering Technology" course, and you've found a course at Galgotias University called "Bachelor in Hotel Management," you don't need to worry. In many cases, institutions may use different names or nomenclature for similar courses.

Rest assured that the "Bachelor in Hotel Management" program at Galgotias University is essentially the same as "Hotel Management and Catering Technology." The core content and focus of the program are likely to be very similar. The change in nomenclature is simply due to the naming convention used by the university. I hope this is clear?
20/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Oh okay
20/10/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Not at all
20/10/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/10/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sharon!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 06:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 06.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.

I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 462 8444: Good evening how are you 
Yes we are ready to connect
07/11/23, 6:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear. I'm doing well, thank you for asking. As we've previously discussed, I understand there are some concerns about arranging the funds for the registration fee. It's crucial for the admission process. Have there been any developments or plans regarding this aspect?
07/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 462 8444: No not as of yet but I would like to believe by the time another offer letter is issued we would have tried raising the funds
07/11/23, 7:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, let us say that if the other offer letter arrives by tomorrow, then would you be prepared for completing the admission process?
07/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 462 8444: No
07/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 71 462 8444: I would not like to believe it is tomorrow
07/11/23, 8:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please, I was just asking, since you mentioned that by the time the offer letter will arrive, you would be ready. Now, on that note, can you please let me know of a date by when you think you would be able to pay the registration fee and then I will help you in understanding more about how I would be helping you with that?
07/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 71 462 8444: We do not have a fixed date
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please help me in understanding more about how much amount have you raised till now for the admission?
15/11/23, 6:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sharon!
I hope you're doing well.
