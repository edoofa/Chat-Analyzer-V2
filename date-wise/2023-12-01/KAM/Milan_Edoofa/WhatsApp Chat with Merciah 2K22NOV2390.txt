How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 330 2452: We are  gud
21/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 330 2452: How about you
21/09/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Yes confirm you saw the documents l sent
21/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
21/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Noted
21/09/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
21/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Offer letter is when you have been offered a place by a certain University and you need to accept the offer by following certain conditions mentioned in the letter
21/09/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/09/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Yes we are together
21/09/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
21/09/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Nice to hear we are looking forward to working with you for a successful journey
21/09/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
21/09/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Yes you may go ahead
21/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
21/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 330 2452: We can proceed
21/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/09/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
21/09/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Yes l am
21/09/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/09/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/09/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Understood
21/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
21/09/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Thank you will process the discussion.
22/09/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
22/09/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Thank you for the update
25/09/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely afternoon?
25/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 330 2452: We are fine and you
25/09/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Yes
25/09/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/09/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 330 2452: No you can go ahead
25/09/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 330 2452: May you provide information on that
25/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Okay l will get into detail with this info
25/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Yes
25/09/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/09/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Okay noted
25/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Yes l am
25/09/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
25/09/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Yes
25/09/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Okay
25/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Understood
25/09/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/09/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
26/09/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Merciah!

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
27/09/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 330 2452: Good morning lm sorry l missed yesterday's session may we continue today
27/09/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 330 2452: No
27/09/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Merciah's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Merciah's is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
27/09/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Yes
27/09/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Merciah's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
27/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Looking forward to that

29/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Merciah!

29/09/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Afternoon can we do it later
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case if I may ask what happened due to which you are wishing to do that later please/
29/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 330 2452: I am busy at work may we continue at around 1600
29/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if I may ask is Merciah available for a discussion please?
29/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Merciah is at school until 1600
29/09/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, once you are ready for the discussion please let me know and then we will continue from there.
29/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Alryt
29/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Hello
29/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 330 2452: May we continue
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Merciah!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead with our discussion here, can you please let me know if you were able to go through the offer letter from Galgotias University by now please?
30/09/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 330 2452: Yes l was
30/09/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
30/09/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 330 2452: 1. $900
2. 4 yrs
3. $300
4.$750
30/09/23, 11:06 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
30/09/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 330 2452: Yes l am
30/09/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
30/09/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
30/09/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
30/09/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 330 2452: Okay noted
30/09/23, 11:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
30/09/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 330 2452: Yes we are
30/09/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
30/09/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 330 2452: Yes we are clear
30/09/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 330 2452: Proceed
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Merciah!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
03/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Yes it is
03/10/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
03/10/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
03/10/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page. <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 330 2452: I am clear with everything unfortunately l think the fees per semester is beyond my reach
03/10/23, 2:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note Merciah, I would like to mention that all the costs that are written on the offer letter, are well under the cost range that was mentioned to you earlier, i.e. $2000-3000 per annum. In that case, what are the challenges that you are facing in bearing them?
03/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 330 2452: I will come back to you
03/10/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I am getting you here, however, for us to have a better clarity on the total costs, shall we first complete the discussion here and then we would proceed?
03/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Okay
03/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Bulawayo
03/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Okay. Thanks
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Meciah!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, shall we move ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter from where we last left?
05/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 245 3420: May we please proceed on Monday mom is not available
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Merciah!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is completely fine dear, what we can do is that we can discuss the letter here, and then on the basis of your understandin of the letter, you can then help your mother understand the same. I believe it would be fine with you, right?
06/10/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 245 3420: Yes that would be fine
07/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Merciah!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, shall we move ahead with our discussion here now?
11/10/23, 11:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Merciah!
I hope you are doing well.

17/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Good evening. We could not afford to get the money for payment
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Merciah!

18/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 330 2452: Is it possible that we defer to next year as l do not think l will be able to raise that amount for now due to other circumstances beyond my control
18/10/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, if you do not mind sharing, can you please let me know what happened due to which you are not able to raise the finances reuqired for Merciah's admission process as of now?
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Merciah!

I hope you are doing well today.
01/11/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, thank you for being available. I wanted to touch base regarding the challenges you mentioned about the payment for Merciah's admission. Is everything alright now, or are you still facing financial difficulties in arranging the required fees?
02/11/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Merciah!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263713892042  I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discsussion here. May I know by when should we reconnect with each other here for continuing with the same?
03/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 389 2042: Am sorry had gone to a funeral. I lost my sister. We can continue
03/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 330 2452: I will exit the group aon this phone and use the other number
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Merciah!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 11:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 6:06 am - +263 71 389 2042: Noted
07/11/23, 5:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Merciah!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 71 389 2042: Yes
07/11/23, 6:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, during our previous discussions, you had mentioned that you are finding it hard to raise the finances for Merciah's admission process, right?
07/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 389 2042: Yes Sir
07/11/23, 7:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for confirming the same here. Now, about that, can you please also let me know how is it that you are planning to move ahead with your admission process, so that I can help you in understanding the same and planning the way ahead?
07/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 71 389 2042: If it is possible can we defer it to 2025 because right now lm in no position to get any money as l earlier on mentioned that l had situations beyond my control that required money. At the moment l cannot make any payment
07/11/23, 8:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. And let us assume that we have shifted Merciah's admission to 2025, in that case, how would you be preparing for the same?
07/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 71 389 2042: I will make a plan Sir
07/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 389 2042: Do you perhaps have a plan that might assist us
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is exaclty what I wish to help you in understanding. Once you decide to postpone things to later time, there might not be any feasible plan that you can work out for, and it may lead you to getting nothing. I hope you understand what I am trying to say. 

On that note, instead of planning for the coming year, shall we move ahead to discuss more about how we can plan the admission process for this year?
08/11/23, 5:59 am - +263 71 389 2042: O

27/11/23, 8:48 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here on the queries that I have shared here please. Hence, may you please let me know of the time that we can connect with each other here to discuss more on that?

27/11/23, 9:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that. However, for today, I am only available till 10.30 AM please, therefore, can we do that now?
27/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 245 3420: Sure no problem
27/11/23, 9:35 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, moving ahead, may you please also let me know of this so that we can proceed with our discussion?
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 71 389 2042: Our supposed sponsor passed away so that is the challenge we encountered therefore we are not financially stable at the moment
28/11/23, 9:38 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Merciah!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 9:38 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this important update with me. I understand that the passing of your sponsor has caused you significant financial hardship and has impacted your plans for Merciah's education. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or distress this may have caused.

I want to assure you that we are here to support you and Merciah during this challenging time. Now, moving ahead, can you please help me in understanding more about how is it that you have planned to complete Merciah's admission process?
28/11/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 389 2042: As for now l do not have any money my salary is not enough to sustain this project that is why l had asked that l defer the program if possible to next intake
28/11/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that. On that note, let us say that you have it deferred to 2024, then how would you be preparing for the same?
28/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 389 2042: May you please allow me to cancel the whole thing if possible because l don't think these questions will get us anywhere
28/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 389 2042: The truth is for now l can not afford to go ahead with this process
29/11/23, 12:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Merciah!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 12:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263713892042 I understand where you are coming from, however, on that note, I would like to mention that if you choose to cancel the scholarship or your idea of moving ahead, I believe that won't be doing any benefit to you. Moving ahead, let us assume that you have indeed stopped the process, then in that case, how will you be proceeding with Merciah's admission process?
30/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 71 389 2042: How do you intend to assist us. Since we have told you that for now we are facing challenges. Is there something that you can assist with
30/11/23, 4:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Merciah!
I hope you are doing well today.
