02/08/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear. I hope you are well. How are you doing today?
02/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 688 5284: Greetings Mr Shivjeet. We are doing well. Thank you and how are you?
02/08/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am well too, thank you for asking. I would like you to know that as agreed before during the time of your admission session. I would like you to know that you will be required to deposit your tuition fees once you have arrived in India within 3 days. So, May I know if you might be able to to do that?
03/08/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 688 5284: Greetings Sir. Hope I find you well. I  had communication with my mother she said she can't meet the demands of this program. She believes if she was told earlier about the fees she would have prepared for it. That is why she asked me to tell you that she wants the refund of the payments that were made to the program. As this was not what we agreed on and the information that was told to us mislead us to think we can afford the schoolarship when we actually can't afford the program.
03/08/23, 1:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I want to acknowledge that I have received your communication and thoroughly understand the situation at hand. I deeply regret any confusion that arose due to the information provided regarding the scholarship's affordability. Our utmost priority is to maintain transparency and ensure all applicants are well-informed about the program's various aspects.

Regarding the admission session, I recall you giving the go-ahead to proceed with the registration process, with the understanding that payment would be required within 3 days of your arrival. However, given the circumstances you've presented, I kindly request you to reconsider this decision.
03/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 688 5284: My apologies. I would have loved to be part of edoofa batch 2023 but it's unfortunate given the present situation. I can not be part of the program. My mother's health is deteriorating every day due to stress. I would not love to come to India leaving her in this situation. My apologies.
08/08/23, 8:15 pm - +27 84 860 4371: Good evening  ,we are still waiting for Vilsha to get to us pls , as my son needs to apply to other schools when it's still early , because for now  we are hopeless in edoofa
11/08/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Beckham!
I hope you are doing well today.

I am Mr. Milan, I am the Senior Admissions Officer at Edoofa.

Now, I had the chance to have a discussion with Mr. Shivjeet regarding your situation and he told me about the challenges that you had faced as well as the concerns that you had. On that note, I decided to have a conversation with you on a personal front so that we an discuss and plan the way ahead for Beckham's higher education and make sure that the hard work that we all have done till this point does not go in vain. 

Now, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other for having a conversation regarding that?

16/08/23, 5:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Beckham, can you please also let me know how is it that you have planned to move ahead with your higher education as of now dear?
16/08/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 688 5284: My plan now is to join some local university or college for further education
16/08/23, 5:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask why is that you wish to join the local university dear, what happened?
16/08/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 688 5284: Things are not moving accordingly. I was planning to go to GGI but due to abrupt changes by the admissions team I couldn't not meet due to lack of information. I thought it was best to join local institutions
17/08/23, 2:23 pm - +27 84 860 4371: Good afternoon Mr Milan, shall we do this in short so that we know what we are doing ,and way forward for my son lm afraid that ,he might  be behind in learning with others,  because endless questions won't help , please shall we focus on the solution before it's not too late for him for his carrier
17/08/23, 5:44 pm - +27 84 860 4371: One question per day without being answered is going to take us too long to finish, hence the school knows absolutely what's the cause of this situation ,please shall we we finish this conversation early , they are due dates for applying everywhere. pls l beg you for my son 's sake
18/08/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Beckham!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/08/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand what you are trying to say, however, when it comes to discussing Beckham's admission process, you can stay assured that we here are also worried about the same. And being the Senior Admission Officer here, I do have some options that I need to discuss with you. Hence, before we do that, can you please let me know of how much would be the costs to send Beckham to a local university please?
18/08/23, 3:37 pm - +27 84 860 4371: Greetings Mr Milan  you will agree with me lf you are a parent, Beckham was 100%  happy for edoofa his heart is very broken that's why l don't want him to be asked a lot of questions since l m not with him l m also far from him ,we only communicate through phones but l tell you he was tearing that l got stressed and got sick  for 2wks now he has accepted that he is not going to india that's why l m protecting him from questions l don't like seeing him tearing the way he was doing
18/08/23, 3:46 pm - +27 84 860 4371: You asked us to have a discussion for him for his high education  we are still waiting to hear what kind of discussion are we going to have then we take it from there , yes he is planning to go to  local schools  but we are still waiting for your discussion as you said  that's why l was saying applying for a place to learn also have some due dates shall we do your discussion fast, then we see what to do after that
18/08/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Mr. Dube. Being a parents I totally agree what you have said and that was the sole reason I stepped in to help you with the challenges that you are facing here. 

Now, the discussion that I wanted to have with you here is that first of all can you please help me understand about the challenges that you are facing in continuing with Beckham's higher education here in India. And I am asking this because once I would be able to understand the challenges better, only then I will be able to help you with the solution that I have with me to offer. I hope you are following?
18/08/23, 3:54 pm - +27 84 860 4371: I'm following but l need to travell now for work thats why l asked to discuss on  monady  last wk now l m traveling for work  lm being disturbed
18/08/23, 3:55 pm - +27 84 860 4371: My apologies

I hope you are doing well today.
21/08/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delay in connecting and responding to your messages earlier. Unfortunately, I was not feeling well and faced a serious illness over the past few days. However, I'm on the path to recovery now and am dedicated to assisting you promptly. Thank you for your understanding and patience.
21/08/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding our discussion, let me schedule it for tomorrow at 10.30 AM and then we will connect with each other to discuss further and plan your admission journey ahead.
21/08/23, 4:54 pm - +27 84 860 4371: Noted thank you
21/08/23, 4:59 pm - +27 84 860 4371: And speed recovery
22/08/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 688 5284: Greetings Mr Milan. Hope I find you well?
22/08/23, 10:41 am - +27 84 860 4371: Good morning sir, yes we are fine
22/08/23, 10:42 am - +27 84 860 4371: And how are you
22/08/23, 11:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Beckham!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/08/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine as well please, thank you for asking. Now, shall we move ahead with our discussion here?
22/08/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 688 5284: This message was deleted
22/08/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 688 5284: Yes we can go ahead
22/08/23, 11:57 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, the discussion that I wanted to have with you here is that first of all can you please help me understand about the challenges that you are facing in continuing with Beckham's higher education here in India. And I am asking this because once I would be able to understand the challenges better, only then I will be able to help you with the solution that I have with me to offer. I hope you are following?
22/08/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 688 5284: The challenge we have is that it's too expensive for us to pay 2450 per year. We were told that the EWYL lessons can help reduce the costs of education but it seems like it's not.  The EWYL made it look like we can afford it. That too the projects are not what I was told. The projects I was told about were doable
22/08/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 688 5284: I will also be very honest. The way we were informed about the program it looked like it's more affordable to study in india with edoofa than studying in Zimbabwe.
22/08/23, 1:00 pm - +27 84 860 4371: The challenges l m facing right now is money, l m working as a helper ,l couldn't manage to pay 850 in 2 weeks time and at the same time save ticket money for Beckham to go to india ,as l was told by the agent that after paying 750us there is no other money to be paid for fees untill the child comes to india ,it was a shock to me and they told me fees will be 2000 per anum since Beckham  will be doing earn while you learn he can use that opportunity to cover some of his fees and he started early learning EYL   . Now , l won't manage to pay 850 in a short notice given by the school
22/08/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your challenges with me here and as I can observe from what you have mentioned, the key challenges that you are facing are only related to the financial requirements for Beckham's higher education here in India, right?
22/08/23, 2:00 pm - +27 84 860 4371: My Boss was willing to help with this 850 that he pays and be deducting monthly but the problem l faced was  that,  the admission officer who was there when l asked keeps on saying pay 850 before 31 July  , or must be paid 3 days of arrival in india , then my Boss lost patience because they were not explaining why to pay in short notice , my greatest worry was, l finished paying 750 in February end  the school kept quiet up to untill mid July that's where l was told about this 850 to be payed in 2 weeks time
22/08/23, 2:00 pm - +27 84 860 4371: After asking admission officer for many times that's where he told me that all students were informed at the same time like us ,   its hard to a parent like me to be informed in short notice to pay a lot of money like this
22/08/23, 2:08 pm - +27 84 860 4371: If l was given  fees break ups early  like lf the school mentioned early after paying 750 you will pay 850 l must have paid from end of February up July,  why did the school decide to tell parents in short notice some of us need to save first
24/08/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Beckham!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/08/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delay in connecting and responding to your messages earlier. Unfortunately, I was not feeling well and faced a serious illness over the past few days. However, I'm on the path to recovery now and am dedicated to assisting you promptly. Thank you for your understanding and patience.
24/08/23, 12:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I was able to go through the messages that you sent here in this group and I can see that due to the lack of immediate finances you were not able to plan Beckham's admission journey ahead and let him come to India.
24/08/23, 12:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if we say that we can offer you the time that you need to raise the required finances, do you think that would be better for you to plan Beckham's higher education here in India and would you be able to facilitate the required money in that time?
25/08/23, 6:46 am - +27 84 860 4371: Good morning , my apologies for not replying in time as l was busy l m very sorry for this, before l answer your question can l ask that , is there any EYL done by the students which they do which helps to reduce  fees  ,2 , fees for all semesters is 750 plus 850 which comes in total of 1600 am l right , please may you make me understand this
28/08/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Beckham!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 688 5284: Good afternoon Mr Milan. I am doing well and how are you?
30/08/23, 6:40 am - +27 84 860 4371: Good morning  admission officer,  l don't think there is any solution here ,why is it taking too long ?

My patience is finishing,this is the sec mth talking of the same thing still no solution
30/08/23, 6:43 am - +27 84 860 4371: I don't like delays coming on my way,  my son needs to do something for his future
31/08/23, 9:23 am - +27 84 860 4371: Good morning Mr Milan , your response will be  appreciated
31/08/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Beckham!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/08/23, 12:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, thank you for sharing your queries with me here. Now, when it comes to the query related to EWYL, yes please, that is right. The EWYL Program is in place for the students to work on and earn scholarship credits for themselves, using which they can reduce their higher education costs even further.
31/08/23, 12:45 pm - +27 84 860 4371: Understanding that one  thank you , may l know fees for every semester is it 750 plus 850 which makes it 1600
31/08/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Moving ahead, I believe Mr. Shivjeet had already shared the cost breakup with you earlier. Let me help you with the same breakdown again: 

1. Tuition Fee Per Year - $1200
2. Hostel and Mess/Food Fees - $1250
3. Registration Fee Paid - $750 ( to be deducted ) 

Now the total becomes $2450 - $750 (Registration Fee) = $1700

Since you have 2 semesters in a year it is now divided into 2 making it $850 per semester. So, as per your first semester you are supposed to pay $850. I hope this is clear?
31/08/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 688 5284: This message was deleted
31/08/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 688 5284: Does this mean that for every semester I will be liable to pay 850 till I finish my degree?
31/08/23, 1:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, the cost breakup that I have shared is for the first year only. Moving ahead, from the second year, the total costs will depend on the type of accommodation that you will choose for yourself. Otherwise, if we do not include the accommodation costs, and look at just the tuition fee part, then the total amount that you would have to pay would become $1200 per annum, which means $600 per semester, is that clear?
31/08/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 688 5284: That is noted. My mother was asking about the EWYL
31/08/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 688 5284: She was asking how best can we depend on the projects
02/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Beckham!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Beckham, when it comes to the contribution of the EWYL Projects as well as how much you can rely on that in order to provide more support to your parents in terms of finances, it completely depends on your performance and consistency with the different projects please. The more you will work hard on the projects, the more you can earn. I hope this is clear

12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. Now, on that note, can you please help me in understanding about how is it that you are planning to come to India and start with your higher education?
12/09/23, 1:12 pm - +27 74 579 8378: We are well thank you , thanks for adding me again
12/09/23, 1:14 pm - +27 74 579 8378: I think he is now late to join others because this is the second mth of the first  semester
12/09/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please that is not true at all. Even though the intake has started, but the classes at Gulzar Group of Institutes haven't started yet and a lot of students are still left to arrive.
12/09/23, 2:11 pm - +27 74 579 8378: You were suppose to tell  us then ,because we don't know
12/09/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand. On that note, can you please let me know how are you preparing for Beckham to arrive here in India as of now?
12/09/23, 2:19 pm - +27 74 579 8378: To be honest l  canceled  all the preparations l have made  because the school told us students are opening 16 th of Aug and the fees must be paid in 31 July or  3 days of arrival in india you never gave me onother options , that's were l asked for refund just because it was a school s faulty to tell us in short notice to pay 850
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - +27 74 579 8378: You said you will help us up  to today you never said the way forward for this
12/09/23, 2:25 pm - +27 74 579 8378: I wasn't saving for Beckham anymore  for india as l was given already a due date to pay without other options now it's surprising me that they are still others on the way  going to india it is a surprise to me
12/09/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that, and indeed it was a matter of miscommunication from both our ends that led us to this situation. However, let us leave what had happened behind and focus on having Beckham, here in India with us as soon as possible. 

For that, can you please help me in understanding about by when is it that you can plan to raise the required funds for his arrival here in India?
13/09/23, 2:06 pm - +27 74 579 8378: Good day , how is it he comes next year because so far ,for now ,l canceled all of my plans concerning him  coming  there ,due to the deadline  dates l was given by the school
13/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Beckham!

13/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: @27745798378 I did not get you here well, can you please help me understand more about your preparations please?
13/09/23, 4:08 pm - +27 74 579 8378: From August l wasn't saving for Beckham that he still goes to india only now you telling me some of the students are still  on the way to go to india l ddnt know there is still a chance for him to also go
13/09/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright, but even if you were not dedicatedly saving for Beckham, you must have saved something as it is right?
13/09/23, 4:11 pm - +27 74 579 8378: This is why , l m asking a question , how about lf he joins you next year august lf it is possible
13/09/23, 4:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I get what you are trying to say, however, my point of concern here is that if you would be able to raise the finances for Beckham's arrival here in India by next month so that we can guide you with that?
13/09/23, 4:22 pm - +27 74 579 8378: If he  comes there next month who is gonna pay for this semester  since now l don't have enough money  for the semester
14/09/23, 12:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Beckham!
I hope you are doing well today.
14/09/23, 12:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, on that note, I would like to know that as of now how much do you think that you can pay towards Beckham's fee?
14/09/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Also, I have some exciting news from the university as well for the students who are facing financial challenges, please let me know when you are online so that I can discuss the same with you
14/09/23, 1:25 pm - +27 74 579 8378: Good afternoon
14/09/23, 2:33 pm - +27 74 579 8378: Presently l don't have money for fees because l wasn't saving   as  l didn't know that he can still be allowed  to join others for schooling  this year
15/09/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I would love to share that with you here. Now, for the students who were planned to arrive here in India this year itself but could not do that till now due to financial issues, the academic board put a step ahead to help them in this situation as well by being ready to help them with waving off a part of the accommodation fee when they will arrive here in India. This means that we will pay a part of your accommodation fee if you choose to come to India this year. How does this sound to you?
15/09/23, 3:44 pm - +27 74 579 8378: This is great news indeed , but can l know how much to pay since l was suppose to 850 how much will be covered by the school so that l can see what to do
15/09/23, 3:45 pm - +27 74 579 8378: The academic will cover only for this semester ?
15/09/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, since you are facing challenges in raising the finances for this semester itself, therefore the academic board wishes to support you in that.
15/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to the accommodation fee that would be waived, then it would be around $100-200 please.
20/09/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 688 5284: Good morning Sir. Hope this message finds you well? I wanted to know is it possible to shift my admissions to next year August.
20/09/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Beckham!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/09/23, 11:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, we would discuss further moving ahead, however, before that, can you please help me in understanding about the reason that you were not able to connect with me here for the past few days?
20/09/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 688 5284: Yes, I am doing well thank you.

21/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Beckham!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, Beckham, can you please let me know by when can I expect a clear update from your end so that we can plan the next steps in your higher education accordingly dear?
21/09/23, 10:22 am - +27 74 579 8378: Greetings  As for Beckham to come next mthd its not going to work , there is  a lot of cash needed 1 ,he  still need to process the visa and ticket money to come there , l won't be able to raise all the expenses and school fees since had canceled for saving for him for school in India due to the due dates l was given by the school
21/09/23, 10:26 am - +27 74 579 8378: Yes l understand the academic is subtracting some few funds in accom , but it's still a lot to  me since l canceled saving for him
21/09/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, how do you wish to plan Beckham's higher education moving ahead please?
21/09/23, 1:39 pm - +27 74 579 8378: Good morning Sir. Hope this message finds you well? I wanted to know is it possible to shift my admissions to next year August.
21/09/23, 1:40 pm - +27 74 579 8378: I have asked this question several times lf l'm not mistaken
21/09/23, 1:44 pm - +27 74 579 8378: After given the due dates to pay 850 l didn't know  he can still come there that is why l stopped saving for him and thought he will join other kids in local schools ,
21/09/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I get what you are saying. However, in that case, I do not think it would be ideal to wait for a whole year when you can still send him to India by October end, I hope this is understood?
22/09/23, 9:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Beckham!

26/09/23, 12:02 pm - +27 74 579 8378: I think  l have answered this session many times ,the reason for not sending him by end of Oct is this , the school didn't inform  us , there is still  a possability  of him coming in Oct therefore ,l over used the ticket mny l was having at that time  because  l had no other way of raising 850 at a given short time
26/09/23, 12:07 pm - +27 74 579 8378: I wish l newed he can still go to india even after opening of schools l was going to save more, but for now  l didn't save just because the school always updates  me everything  when there is no time
26/09/23, 12:27 pm - +27 74 579 8378: As far as l know some parents are now saving for second semester when will l start saving  for second semester ? , then, my son will not be allowed to go to the classes untill  l pay, which is not good  l will be always on pressure of paying fees

27/09/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once the student is done with the program they are doing, the universities as well as we here at Edoofa make sure ot help the students with their career as well by making sure that they can get good job opportunities. I hope this is clear?
