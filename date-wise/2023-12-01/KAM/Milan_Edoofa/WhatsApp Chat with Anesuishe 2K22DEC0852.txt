01/09/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 620 1119: Morning sir, yes we can
01/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 738 3491: Greetings
01/09/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 738 3491: Yes we can proceed
01/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to learn that you are open to discussing this matter. Before we get into the specifics, I wanted to share a recent development that could significantly influence your educational journey.

Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university here in India. This collaboration has prompted the academic board to revisit scholarship opportunities for a select group of students, including yourself, with the intention of providing a more enhanced educational pathway.

Under this new collaboration, the university is offering more substantial scholarship opportunities for the course related to your field of study, particularly in the field of Commerce.
01/09/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Through this unique opportunity, you are in a position to secure a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fee, along with a 100% sponsorship for your accommodation expenses. What's particularly striking is the potential to significantly alleviate the financial burdens tied to education. This could effectively bring down your annual expenses to just $1600, encompassing all essential aspects of your education and residence.

I am eager to hear your initial thoughts on this matter. Would you be interested in exploring this specialized course further and getting into the finer details of how this opportunity could potentially transform your educational journey?
01/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 738 3491: That's amazing news.It is pretty much interesting.Yes , we you can dive deeper.
01/09/23, 10:25 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know that you are ready to know more about the opportunity. Moving ahead, after thorough reconsideration of your application as well as a proper analysis of your documents, the academic board has suggested that you should pursue the course B.Com. for your higher education here in India for the given opportunity since it would help you in having a better career in the future as well as you would also be able to make your higher education even more affordable. I hope you understand?
01/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 738 3491: Yes I do understand. However,my concern evolves around the issue of  having a career I wanted since I've never put my thoughts around commerce.So I would love for you to enlighten me on what to go for when it comes to the commercial field.
01/09/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Absolutely, I understand your concern, and it's important to make an informed decision about your career path. Let me provide you with some insights into the field of Commerce and how pursuing a B.Com. course can open doors to various career opportunities:
01/09/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: *Versatility*: A Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) degree is highly versatile. It covers a wide range of subjects such as accounting, finance, economics, marketing, and business management. This diversity allows you to explore different aspects of the business world before specializing.
01/09/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: *Career Options*: With a B.Com. degree, you can pursue careers in fields like accounting, banking, finance, marketing, human resources, and more. It's a degree that can adapt to your changing interests over time.
01/09/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: *High Demand*: Many industries require professionals with a strong understanding of commerce. This degree can provide a solid foundation for roles in both the public and private sectors.
01/09/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: *Entrepreneurship*: If you ever dream of starting your own business, a B.Com. degree equips you with essential knowledge about managing finances and understanding market dynamics.
01/09/23, 10:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, considering the substantial scholarship and sponsorship opportunities available for this course, it can significantly ease the financial burden associated with higher education. This makes it an attractive option to explore, especially if it aligns with your career goals and interests.
01/09/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 738 3491: Yes this is amazing but however this course is very good but the course according to the functionality of Zimbabwe and research I've done.This course is no longer marketable and recognized.
01/09/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 620 1119: We understand you sir , but the commerce part you mentioned... The courses have now flooded in Zimbabwe, we no longer have the running industries , moreover much of her interest was aligned to the geographical side
01/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Yes I do understand where you are coming from but my family and I have decided to stick to geography.Maybe if you would have offered me a course that is aligned with geography.The problem here is that the mind had already settled for Geography because I have a better knowledge of that.
01/09/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: I do understand that, however, why is it that you are more inclined towards Geography and not the course that the academic board is offering you?
01/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 300 9415: Hallo Mr Milan , probably we are seeming to be rigid.Its all about what my daughter wants to persue in life.She can cope up with any situation and challenges .That much I know she won't disappoint you.She has already braced her self  as an academia at LPD university.Or maybe there are now some challenges,we understand you can share.For the better ment of my daughter.
01/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 300 9415: Sorry PDM
01/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 738 3491: I'm very much interested in studying the environment and besides that saving the flora and fauna has become a great aspiration within me because of what other humans do .I have a burning passion in carryout and studying Geography or Geology.
01/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Honestly I myself am now confused because I was  now prepared for the last hurdle which is receiving my dates and now changing things it's now a bit stressing
01/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 738 3491: However, I do understand where you are coming from .
01/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 620 1119: As  a parent lm also confused, l thought changing of the course was supposed to be done at the initial stage,,, At this stage we were waiting for the arrival dates, but it seems we're starting again... Are there any challenges concerning her taking up B.Geo if so please let us know.
02/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesuishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries here, and I would be more than happy to help you with that. Now, when it comes to the fact that why is it that we are reconsidering Anesuishe's application now, then there are two main reasons for that:

1. Anesuishe's application is being reconsidered as a part of a whole batch of students who were shortlisted for the opportunity that the academic board is offering here in which they get the chance to study a much better course that can lead them to have a better career with the costs being cut down to a huge margin to ensure that they can be comfortable with the finances of their higher education as well. Is that clear now.

2. Just recently the university experience rankings and overall rankings were released among the educational partners here in India and in that, PDM University did not do quite well while MVN was among the top performers. Additionally, the response that we are receiving from the side of the students at PDM University has not been too good as well in terms of the experience that they are getting. Now, since we wanted to make sure that each one of our students should get the best while they are here in India.
02/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 620 1119: Thank you sir , that's the vital information we needed to hear from you... With this information l think as a family we are abiding by your choice because it's now very clear
02/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Thank you Sir this information has cleared out the questions that were in mind and now that I have discussed with my parents I'm now considering your choice of taking up B.Com
04/09/23, 11:22 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anesuishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
04/09/23, 11:23 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have understood the same. Now, shall I move ahead to share the confirmation with the university officials and get the offer letter arrange for the mentioned course?
04/09/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 738 3491: We are doing quite well thank you

08/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Thank you.We have browsed through it.
08/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are so excited about the offer letter please. Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the letter by now please?
08/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Yes Sir we were
08/09/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
08/09/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? 
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
08/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Okay that's great
08/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Anesuishe, please go through the letter once and then let me know.
08/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 738 3491: 1.$0
2.$0
3.$1250
4.$250
5.$575
08/09/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout your course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
08/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Done
08/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Yes that correct Sir it's really amazing I
08/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 738 3491: I'm happy to get such an amazing offer
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1250 + $250 = $1500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1250. I hope you are clear about that?
08/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Yes Sir that's amazing.Can I ask if the grant that I won of $750 would be applicable in this case?
08/09/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Anesuishe, the grant that you had received will only be applicable on your fee from the second year onwards. For now, you would have to pay the required fee as is dear. I hope this is cleaR?
08/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Okay it is noted thank you.
08/09/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
08/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 620 1119: Sir, since we had already paid some money that went towards Anesuishe's first year fee at PDM university, which I believe is transferred.Will there any short falls and what's the balance if so?
08/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 738 3491: Yea I am clear Sir thank you.
08/09/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we will discuss that moving ahead. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
08/09/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
08/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 620 1119: Yes that I know and I'm very clear regarding it thanks to your Edoofa team. Thank you very much.
08/09/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1250 and so the balance fee becomes $1250 - $1000 = $250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
08/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 620 1119: Yes , she is surely working on that.
08/09/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1500 - $1000 = $500.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
08/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 620 1119: Yes I have noted that...So she has to pay the remaining $500 there in India?
08/09/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Now, moving ahead, as you can see the admission fee for MVN University is $1000, and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. Can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
08/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 620 1119: I think by tomorrow
08/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 620 1119: If l encounter any challenges will let you know
08/09/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear. Now, coming to the payment mode for the same, I believe you made the payment of your registration fee earlier through Mr. Charles's FBC Account, right? Will you be using the same mode again to clear the balance as well?
08/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 620 1119: Yes
08/09/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, there is an update in Mr. Charles's banking details and you would have to make the payment on the below mentioned deails:

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
08/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 620 1119: Thank you sir
08/09/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
08/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 620 1119: For today l no longer have questions

I hope this message finds you well and excited about your upcoming journey to MVN University. We are eagerly anticipating your arrival and can't wait to welcome you to our campus.

Initially, we were informed that only a few students would be arriving, and as they were planning their travels individually, they were expected to board the cab from the airport with our assistance. We understand that making travel plans can be a bit overwhelming, especially when coming to a new place.
18/09/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, we also recognize the concerns and sentiments of parents who want to ensure a smooth transition for their children. With this in mind, we have made extra arrangements to be at the airport tomorrow to assist you.

Please note that you have to wait for the team and keep the following details in mind for your arrival:

- Location to wait for the team: KFC near gate number 6, pillar number 14
- Arrival Time of the team: 03:30 PM, IST

You have to wait for your fellow students at this designated location. This way, you can avoid traveling alone, and you'll have some great company as you embark on this new adventure. *Ms. Kirti* (that's me!) and *Mr. Shivjeet* will be there to greet you and provide any necessary assistance.
18/09/23, 4:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Your safety and comfort are our top priorities, and we want to ensure that your journey to our campus is as smooth as possible. Please make sure you have a safe flight, and we look forward to meeting you tomorrow as you begin this exciting new chapter in your life.
