I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM.

Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
21/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 976 4914: Hi

They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
29/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
29/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe Takunda wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Technology in Chemical Engineering for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
30/09/23, 10:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takunda.

30/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Okay thank you have a nice weekend
02/10/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Iam  ready for  connection
03/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are in good health. Kindly excuse me for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a strong believer in Nonviolence, which helped India to active Political and Social changes.
03/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the long weekend and the national holiday, it was impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available?
03/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Okay
03/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 657 0486: I'm not available until tomorrow
03/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges, as we are unable to have a smooth conversation?
04/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 657 0486: I was a little bit challenge d but now I'm free  we may proceed with the discussion
05/10/23, 11:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Yes I am available
05/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
05/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
05/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
05/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Yaah
05/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
05/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
05/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
05/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 657 0486: It's not possible yes
05/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
05/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 657 0486: I've gone through
05/10/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, I hope you do resonate with the message above here?
05/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Yes I did
05/10/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2700 to $3700 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Yes we are on the same page
05/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
05/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Taken note of it
05/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $3600 as per the above example.
05/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $3600 - $750 = $2850. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1425 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1425 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
05/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Okay
05/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
05/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
05/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
05/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Understood
05/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 657 0486: I have no queri  only to ask if the admission process will give you  time frame for payment
05/10/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. As we move ahead your query shall be cleared please do not worry.
05/10/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
05/10/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
05/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 657 0486: That's what we are  praying for
05/10/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/10/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

05/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 657 0486: I have reviewed the benefits
05/10/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

05/10/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263776570486 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Okay
05/10/23, 5:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 5:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Understood
05/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Okay
05/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/10/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
07/10/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, I was hoping to connect with you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are facing any challenges, since I noticed that you were able to go through my message?
07/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 657 0486: Yeah lm now connected
07/10/23, 11:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
07/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 657 0486: Yeah we are clear
07/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 657 0486: We are connected
07/10/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/10/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Yeah we are aware
07/10/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/10/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
07/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 657 0486: And we can proceed
07/10/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you were clear here and go through the message?
07/10/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Yeah we are through
07/10/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Can we procced
07/10/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and a great weekend ahead.
07/10/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Yeah understood
07/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Thank you very much
09/10/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
09/10/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
10/10/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to connect with you, however, you did not respond, I would appreciate it if you share your challenges with us here so that we can assist you accordingly. May I know if we are still connected @263776570486?
10/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 657 0486: We are connected
10/10/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. So may I know if you are clear so far?
10/10/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263776570486 may I know if we are still connected with each other?
10/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Was a little bit busy but for now I'm free
10/10/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand that might be occupied with work. May I know if you are clear so far
10/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Yes lam clear
10/10/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Yaah
10/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263776570486 may I know if we are connected with each other?
11/10/23, 7:43 am - +263 77 657 0486: That's wonderful benefit of course
11/10/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takunda.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/10/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Let's connect  I am available now
11/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. May I know if you are clear so far?
11/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 657 0486: I'm clear
11/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
11/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Quiet understood
11/10/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Okay
11/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 657 0486: No I don't
11/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Takunda's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Takunda is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Okay  excited for next step is what I am
11/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Waiting for the offer letter
11/10/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
17/10/23, 11:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takunda,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. We have some incredible news to share with you and your family! 

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application at the universities in India under the Endowment plan.
17/10/23, 11:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With all the efforts we have invested, I am thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Lovely Professional University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, as we received it early, we wanted to share it with you early and get a head start on our discussions. Please take your time to thoroughly review the letter, and then we will discuss its contents in detail.
17/10/23, 11:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, I would encourage you to note down any queries or concerns that may arise as you review the letter.

20/10/23, 10:33 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, we have not heard from your end since then, and as a result, I have been awaiting your response so that we can discuss your offer letter, help you complete your university admission formalities, and move forward to the next stage in your journey to India. Hence, could you please confirm if you have had the opportunity to review my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the message you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
27/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 657 0486: Sorry for the late response were experiencing some network challenge  kindly share with me the opportunity to get an extra time for our discussion be it tomorrow or today
03/11/23, 1:33 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Takunda,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the admissions for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 1:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are in good health and I was able to go through your last message. I understand your concerns, @263776570486 and since the time you received your offer letter, I have noticed that we haven't been able to make any significant progress due to network challenges and our tight schedules. It is essential to have a fruitful discussion about your offer letter and the next steps for your university admission and higher education. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 1:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Considering the network challenges you mentioned, we want to make sure the discussion is convenient for you.

I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?

23/11/23, 10:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for joining today's session. As my available hours are concluding, and it has been a long day, I'll be closing our session for now. Let's reconvene tomorrow starting from 01:00 PM to continue our discussion. Have a wonderful evening, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
