27/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
27/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Yes there are clear
27/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 71 850 2365: I am following very well
27/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Well understood
27/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Okay we can begin
27/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Yes I'm ready
27/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

27/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
27/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
27/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to schedule our session for Friday at 8:30 PM. I hope by that time you might be able to watch the videos. Have a great night.
27/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Thank you l will go through them and submit the feedback as intended
27/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Thank you be blessed too
28/09/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 850 2365: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Takunda

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Thank you for sharing the finished front page of the form. May I know if you were able to watch the videos so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
29/09/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Good evening
29/09/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 850 2365: I have watched the video as intended and l have understood that to be successful, l have to follow the critical path of instructions you ar giving to me .From the founders of Edoofa l also understood that l must fill the form for instance the Statement Of Purpose
29/09/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 850 2365: I have understood that Edoofa is established 0rganisation with an experience of over ten years.You help students get vacancy at internationally recognized universities.
29/09/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very good carry on!
29/09/23, 8:46 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Yes l have managed to watch the videos
29/09/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 850 2365: The last video is about following instructions, reflecting the processes that lead to a person acquiring a scholarship
29/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
29/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Yeah we are together
29/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
29/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tuesday 5:30 PM.
29/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

04/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 315 7639: You can share with me

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 315 7639: We are fine.I hope you are well as well
05/10/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the session?

05/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know if it would be comfortable to proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Well I will be out driving in some minutes.I don't know if you proceed with your contribution and if you can allow me to respond when I am free
05/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have taken a note of it. Very well, I shall proceed.
05/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
05/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
05/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
05/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student.

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you lately. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 315 7639: We are well.I hope you are fine.Takunda is yet home school.I don't if it is well to continue with me
09/10/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 315 7639: From
09/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Know
09/10/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed we can. Regarding the previous conversation, please do not worry about it. We will be there to guide you through the process and the right university choice for you.
09/10/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok I am waiting in anticipation
09/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
09/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
09/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
09/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 315 7639: It is correct
09/10/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 315 7639: It is very clear
09/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
09/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
09/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
09/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Understood but I have a question on the 500 -750 registration fee, can there be any allowance for extension of time to pay that money if begs
09/10/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please do not worry about that right now. You will be well-informed about the deadlines of the fee well in advance so that you have a better planning of your finances.
09/10/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Thank you
09/10/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
09/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Well explained
09/10/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/10/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
09/10/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/10/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 315 7639: It is very clear
09/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
09/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
09/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 315 7639: I am glad to see that.God will make us succeed.
09/10/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 315 7639: I am ready
09/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Continue
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 315 7639: I appreciate the effort put by you to make things easier for us
09/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Very much so.Infact  it is fantastic
09/10/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 315 7639: I thank you for that
09/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and let's connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
09/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Well I hope to seek help from you if I may have challenges
09/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Thank you the same to you
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Takunda, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Fine .I.hope you are well
10/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 315 7639: It is ok we can continue
10/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Provide me more information
10/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Can you clarify on the last part
10/10/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly! If a student does well and achieves good results, the university will review their application again. Based on this review, they will decide how much scholarship the student will receive. The Endowment Plan offered by Edoofa gives students an advantage because it helps them perform better in their admission process, increasing their chances of receiving more scholarship compared to other students who do not have this assistance.
10/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok thank you
10/10/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 315 7639: I agree
10/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok
10/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok
10/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Very clear
10/10/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Let's move forward
10/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Takunda's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Takunda is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
10/10/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Let me know the next steps
10/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your enthusiasm. For now, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
10/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok thank you
10/10/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the mean time wiith your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Takunda's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
10/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 315 7639: That's fine
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takunda.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 04.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey.

14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda!

I wanted to ensure that you have a better understanding of the offer letter, and to allow for a more detailed discussion of your concerns, I'd like to reschedule our conversation for tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT. Please be prepared with any questions or concerns you may have, and we will address them during our discussion. Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow. Have a pleasant evening ahead.
14/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Noted thank you.
15/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takunda!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 315 7639: Fine.i have gone through it.I want to know how accommodation is going to charged
15/10/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 315 7639: Probably you can help me how we can to the amount per year
15/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 315 7639: Help through the breakdown up to the total amount payable per  year
15/10/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, we will discuss all the things in detail moving ahead in our discussion. For now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 315 7639: 😛😛1-
1-900 dollars
2-3years
3-300 dollars
4-750 dollars
15/10/23, 11:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 315 7639: Very clear
15/10/23, 12:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 12:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 12:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok I am following
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 6:08 am - +263 77 315 7639: Morning how are you today.I am sorry by the you came back to continue I had gone to sleep
16/10/23, 6:09 am - +263 77 315 7639: Yes we are together
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, I understand. I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 2:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
16/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Oh yes we're good
16/10/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 315 7639: I have noticed the deadlines.The timeframe  is a bit difficult for me .I have to be honest. I had been clearing balances for your student three other children who came after Takunda. I do have projects that start bearing fruit in January.Never the less I am putting effort to see that we succeed.I don't know what what happens in case the deadline is not met
16/10/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that. Now, on that note, can you please help me in understand how are you planning to prepare for completing Takunda's registration and moving ahead?
16/10/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Let me focus on the timeline.Need of help I will be in touch with you
17/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, shall we move ahead with our discussion here now?
17/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Afternoon.ok
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Proceed
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Harare
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok contact saved
17/10/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
17/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 315 7639: No ,I have  that account
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
18/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok it's fine
18/10/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/10/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 315 7639: It is clear
18/10/23, 4:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
18/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 315 7639: I'm happy to hear that
18/10/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 315 7639: You can continue
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

19/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 315 7639: It is nice place
19/10/23, 1:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok fine
20/10/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
20/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Fine and I hope you are well.
20/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 315 7639: I am sorry we had no bundles to download it.Today I will do it tomorrow we will have discussed it
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Once you are done with that, please let me know.
20/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok thank you
20/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 315 7639: I am failing to get through on our conversation.I am being asked to send the OTP which is being said to have been send to me. But I have not received one
20/10/23, 5:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you well here dear, which OTP are you talking about here please?
20/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Sorry I went to the platform
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear.
20/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 315 7639: We have read the offer letter
20/10/23, 8:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. How was your discussion regarding the offer letter?
20/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 315 7639: The issue of school accodation is the one that that is a little bit expensive. I think it is safest place for students. I don't know how safe is it for a student who does not know much about the surroundings in your country.
20/10/23, 9:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is indeed true. On campus accommodation are indeed safe. However, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please. 

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. On that note, you can expect almost the same things from the off-campus facilities with just a low price, I hope this is clear?
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 315 7639: It is ok . well I want to know how do we go about it in the event that the student falls sick in there
20/10/23, 9:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's a valid concern, and it's great that you're thinking about your child's well-being while studying abroad. In the event that a student falls sick while at Galgotias University, there are established procedures and support systems in place to ensure their health and safety.

Galgotias University has a dedicated Health Center with experienced medical staff who can provide basic medical assistance. They can attend to minor illnesses, injuries, or provide first aid. I hope this is clear?
21/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Good afternoon.I hope you are fine
21/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Clear you can proceed
21/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you have any other queries with respect to the offer letter as of now?
21/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 315 7639: For now I do not have a question.
21/10/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, were you able to have a conversation with your family about the offer letter from by now?
21/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Yes we did so
21/10/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know! Now, what were your family's thoughts on the same and what did you manage to discuss?
21/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Accommodation: I asked about that
Health issues: you clarified on that
We took note of what is expected to be fulfilled by us as far as school payment is concerned
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
23/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 315 7639: Fine.You can proceed
23/10/23, 11:06 am - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
23/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 315 7639: No these days our network has not been doing well.I will do so
23/10/23, 11:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Sure, I would advise you to do that as well. As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.
 
Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
23/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 315 7639: I will advise you as you very soo
23/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 315 7639: Soon
23/10/23, 11:17 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. However, by when should I expect your response on that please?
23/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 315 7639: End of this week
23/10/23, 12:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is completely fine please. However, since your deadline for making the payment is also at the end of this week, then I would advise you to plan for that within a day or two so that we can complete the admission process in a timely manner. I hope this is understood, right?
23/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Ok
23/10/23, 12:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
24/10/23, 10:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
25/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Good afternoon.I am sorry I had no bundles so I could Not be able to connect you at the right time.
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. On that note, if I may ask are you comfortable in moving ahead with our discussion here now?
26/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Fine we can move forward
26/10/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, can you please let me know if you were able to plan about the date when you will be paying your registration fee please?
26/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 315 7639: For now it is proving to be hard to do that within the time given to me.I was overwhelmed by fees for other three students and I had hope that by January I would start Takunda' s program.I have been trying hard to raise that money now, but because of what I have said, it is proving to be hard for me now.Now I want guidance from you if there can be that allowance or not.
27/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Good afternoon.Can I be allowed to do that starting January.
27/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Doing the same as outlined above
30/10/23, 7:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/10/23, 7:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I apologize for not responding to your message earlier. When you replied, it was outside of my working hours, and it happened to be the weekend, so our team was unavailable. Thank you for your patience.
30/10/23, 7:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, if you wish to wait till the coming year, to complete Takunda's admission process, then being the Senior Admission Officer here, I would advise you to not do that, since there are several reasons for that. 

1. You would firstly lose on the Endowment Program Benefits that you are getting here. 

2. By the coming year most of the students would have completed their admission processes already and in that case you might not get the same scholarship offers that you are getting now. <This message was edited>
30/10/23, 7:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: 3. Moreover, over the past 5-6 years that I have been helping the students in completing their admissions, I have seen that untimely actions in securing the scholarship often leads the students into getting to a position where they lose out on the scholarship seats entirely as by the time they become ready, the seats are already filled in. 

I hope you would understand the same right?
31/10/23, 4:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/10/23, 4:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to revert to me here in the group earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion further.

31/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 315 7639: Fine . I have seen the message .It's only that i am working at night, so I will asleep during the day    and at work at night until Sunday .I will be off next week . So this week it is hard to communicate flowingly.  But I will answer you as and when I see your messages.

I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 07:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 07.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
