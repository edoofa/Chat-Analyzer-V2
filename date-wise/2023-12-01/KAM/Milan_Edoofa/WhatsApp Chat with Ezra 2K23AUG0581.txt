Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
11/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes
11/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Done
11/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose. <This message was edited>
11/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
11/09/23, 10:11 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes they are
12/09/23, 2:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Ezra.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 


Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Afternoon
12/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Noted
12/09/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/09/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following....
12/09/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/09/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following....
12/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 540 6633: So this isn't part of that money $350
12/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 540 6633: U mean another $500 will be needed?on top of the $350 we supposed to pay
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Or its the same process that we did.. already...
12/09/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
12/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Is it the same fee that we supposed to pay that $350
12/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 540 6633: To secure for a seat?
12/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you understand here. The fee that you have paid which is $350 was the fee for enrollment into the edoofa program which will guarantee you the scholarship program for your higher education and the process of your EWYL that will help you earn credits that will lower the tuition fees for your higher education.
12/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Can this be paid by EWYL program
12/09/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since the registration process is a crucial step in securing a seat at the university and must be given top priority, the registration fees will not be applicable when you leverage the EWYL program credits. So you will be required to pay the fees for the registration fee without the credits. Is this clear to you?
12/09/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Ok
12/09/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
13/09/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Ezra!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
13/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Well was still digesting from   everything.....
13/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Especially from the enrollment fee

18/09/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Ezra,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Weekend was okay....and how was yours
18/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. It was good too, thank you for asking. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
18/09/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is late and it has been a long day for me, and the available hours are coming to an end, we shall proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon at 4:00 PM. I hope this works for you, and have a great night.
19/09/23, 6:02 am - +263 78 540 6633: goodmorning
19/09/23, 6:03 am - +263 78 540 6633: Will try my best to be avail at 4pm
19/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Ezra,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. 

Please let me know if you are available and ready so that we can proceed with the session.
19/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Wow thus good
19/09/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes i am available
19/09/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
19/09/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
19/09/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
19/09/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes we are
19/09/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
19/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 4:30 PM.
19/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

19/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

24/09/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 540 6633: 3.Difference between prosecutor and Attorney is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt;while the defense attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the clients innocence
24/09/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 540 6633: 4.I am interested in persuing criminal law because a career in criminal justice is a great way to give back to your community .The field is full of jobs that help others  ;from law enforcement to working in the court system thus protecting people from criminal activity ;helping crime victims and ensuring justice for them and society.

25/09/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 540 6633: evening

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
26/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 540 6633: evening mr shivjeet
26/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Nice quotes
26/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes we can start
26/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'd like to provide an update that unfortunately, I won't be able to connect with you today for our admission process session due to unexpected tasks demanding my attention. Therefore, I'd like to propose rescheduling our session for tomorrow evening at 5:00 PM. Please let me know if this time works for you?
26/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 540 6633: The time will work for me thanks
27/09/23, 4:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Ezra. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
27/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Afternoon
27/09/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are available to proceed with the session?
27/09/23, 5:25 pm - +263 78 540 6633: U can go ahead
27/09/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/09/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Correct
27/09/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
27/09/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes
27/09/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/09/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/09/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/09/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/09/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Right..
27/09/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/09/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/09/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/09/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Too expensive though.....
27/09/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Initially i think i came across the fee late in the process of admission....meaning we had already started the admission process coz as to raise $750 in less than a month with our situation personally and economically it will be a challenge
27/09/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 540 6633: I don't know how best we can help each other on that one
27/09/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please do not worry about it right now. We will help you with payment plans in our future session very soon.
27/09/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Thank you for considering...
27/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/09/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes
27/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
27/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
27/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
03/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Ezra. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session? <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Good day mr shivjeet hope u enjoyed your holiday
03/10/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, I did may I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 540 6633: U can proceed
03/10/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
03/10/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Evening
04/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 540 6633: U can go ahead
04/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Will try to follow
04/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
04/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
04/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
04/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/10/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 540 6633: The query and challenge that um afraid so far is on how i will raise the registration fee $750
04/10/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Each time i think about it .....it leaves me helpless
04/10/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that it might be a challenge. Please do not worry about it right now. You will be informed well in advance about the deadlines so that you can prepare the finances in a timely manner. May I know if you are clear to proceed?
04/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes we can
04/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
04/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session for Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
04/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Noted....
05/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Afternoon
05/10/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are ready shall we proceed with the session.
05/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Ok
05/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
05/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
05/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
05/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Noted
05/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Hope so too
05/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Awesome
05/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
05/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
05/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
05/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following...
05/10/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/10/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
05/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following.....
05/10/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
05/10/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following
05/10/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following
05/10/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following
05/10/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following.....what happens incase if i miss the deadline
05/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
05/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
09/10/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student.

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you lately. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Evening
09/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 540 6633: How r u mr shivjeet
09/10/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 540 6633: U can continue
09/10/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing great, thank you for asking.
09/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With regards to our previous conversation, may I know if you are clear and currently on the same page to further proceed with the session?
09/10/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yeah its clear
09/10/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Thus great
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Please go ahead
09/10/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following...
09/10/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following
09/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes.....
09/10/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following
09/10/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Afternoon mr shivjeet lets make it happen
10/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes please
10/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Ezra's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Ezra is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
10/10/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes we are
10/10/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Thus good to hear
10/10/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Ezra's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
10/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 540 6633: noted

16/10/23, 2:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
16/10/23, 2:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/10/23, 2:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
17/10/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ezra!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier, so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion here. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
17/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 540 6633: After noon
17/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 540 6633: The accommodations are just expensive
17/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Everything just expensive
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 540 6633: We cannot afford it.....think i stated our situation at the beginning of this program.....
17/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 540 6633: $750 is needed within 15 days where will i get such kind of money
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ezra!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, shall we move ahead to discuss the same and work towards having the best solution planned in this situation?
18/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Afternoon how are u
18/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Noted
18/10/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Moving ahead, I believe your main concern is on the total per annum costs for Ezra's higher education, right?
18/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes please
19/10/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ezra!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 540 6633: After noon noted
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Ezra!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Evening mr milan
19/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Um now available
20/10/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ezra!
I hope you are doing well today.

20/10/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am fine please, how are you Ezra? <This message was edited>

20/10/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, shall we move ahead to complete our discussion regarding the offer letter here?
20/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 540 6633: U welcome
20/10/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding this query of yours, let us first complete the discussion about the letter and then we will discuss it, will that be okay with you?
20/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Go ahead
20/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following
20/10/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Noted....
20/10/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
20/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Yes....
20/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
20/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Following
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 540 6633: Hwange
20/10/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 10:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263785406633 May I know if we are connected with each other here please?
20/10/23, 11:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: As it's getting late on my end, I'd like to schedule our next conversation for tomorrow at 09:00 AM CAT.
