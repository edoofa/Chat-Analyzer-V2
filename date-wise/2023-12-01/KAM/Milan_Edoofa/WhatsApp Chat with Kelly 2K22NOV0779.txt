14/11/22, 1:16 pm - You were added
01/08/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 639 2938: Good evening
04/08/23, 6:44 am - +263 77 247 9571: Good morning everyone I am Kelly's mom. It's final that Kelly will not be going to India. She will be doing her studies locally. We kindly request for a refund of the money we paid to you, this will help her pay for her studies here thank you.
16/08/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Kelly. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Thank you for sharing the update with me. I would like you to know that you are not eligible for a refund as it is clear that you have forfeited your admission.
18/08/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Kelly. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I want to clarify the circumstances surrounding the refund in light of your situation.

As per our policies, when a student decides to forfeit their admission and is no longer able to continue with their higher education, it, unfortunately, results in the inability to provide a refund. The decision to discontinue the admission was not taken lightly as the seat was specially reserved for you at the university.
18/08/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Good afternoon it is not like a decision was actually made to forfeit the admission but we realized that we could not afford to continue with it, and opted for something affordable locally, am sure you are able to find someone who can take that place that was reserved for Kelly and give us a refund so that we can be able to pay for Kelly's fees here please
14/09/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Day @263772479571
14/09/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: I hope you are doing well
14/09/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: We can certainly talk about it, may I know will you be available to discuss the same
14/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Good day to you as well
14/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Yes I am available
14/09/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to know that.

Have you started with your higher education in Zimbabwe?
14/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Yes she has, (Kelly). You are chatting with Kelly's mom
15/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Harare Institute of 
Technology. She's studying Food Processing
15/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 247 9571: In Harare
15/09/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask how much are the costs for the same as well?
15/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 247 9571: It's 450 USD per semester
15/09/23, 4:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: This means that you are paying $900 per annum for the tuition fee, right?
15/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Exactly, the reason why I am asking for a refund so that I will be able to pay the fees
16/09/23, 10:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kelly!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/09/23, 10:59 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that and we will discuss about that moving further as well. However, for now, I would like to know that earlier when you had enrolled Kelly to the Edoofa Program, she wanted to do a Computer Science Engineering Program, whereas now, she has been admitted to a Food Processing Program, may I know why is that?
16/09/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Well she decided to go for that program which is not so popular with many people, this might help to beat  competition for employment
16/09/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please I get that, however, if you think from the other perspective, it may be possible that the course is not in much demand that is why it is not popular, right?
18/09/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, how would it sound to you if we would be able to provide you with an opportunity where Kelly can study the same course that she intended to earlier?
19/09/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 247 9571: Well thank you for the offer but as we said before, we cannot afford to pay the annual fees and all the other expenses linked to your scholarship
19/09/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kelly!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/09/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that, note, may I know how much is it that you can afford for Kelly's higher education per annum?
19/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 247 9571: 900USd
19/09/23, 2:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, I do not believe that you would be able to raise even the local education costs as well, have you checked about that?
19/09/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 247 9571: I don't know where this conversation is going to take us really
20/09/23, 8:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kelly!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/09/23, 8:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, if you do not wish to continue with the conversation that is completely fine. 

On that note, since Kelly is now already admitted to a local university, and that you had already paid her registration fee, I believe you must be thinking about the registration fee that you had paid for her admission to the university and you must be wanting to get that back. Regarding that, I do have something to discuss with you, may I know by when can we do that?
20/09/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 247 9571: Good morning, we can discuss this now
20/09/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, since you had completed the admission process for Kelly earlier, now in order to get the refund of the amount that you paid for the registration, what you need to do is to get the scholarship seat transferred to another student. Do you know how to do that?
20/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Not exactly
21/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kelly!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting that came up. Now, I appreciate your patience here.
21/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, shall we move ahead with the discussion here so that I can help you in understanding more about the seat transfer option please?
21/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 247 9571: Good morning
21/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 247 9571: Yes
21/09/23, 12:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Let me help you understand more about the seat transfer option here. Now, since you had already completed your admission at the university, your seat was reserved at that time. Now, in order for you to get back the registration fee that you had paid, what you have to do is that you need to connect with another student who is in need of that scholarship seat and then let them complete their admission process for the same. Once they would complete their registration process at the university, you will then be entitled to get back the registration fee that you had paid. I hope this is clear?
21/09/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Ok where can I connect with the student
21/09/23, 3:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kelly, for that, you would have to connect with the students in your community or around you to see who can benefit from the Edoofa Program and get them to be ready for the seat transfer option so that they can get your seat, I hope this is clear?
22/09/23, 9:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kelly!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/09/23, 9:54 am - Milan Edoofa: @263772479571 , I was expecting you to respond to the last message that I had shared here in this group, may I know by when can we reconnect with each other here, to continue with the discussion that we were having about your higher education?
22/09/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 247 9571: Good morning, it can be very difficult for Kelly to find someone who wants to take up your scholarship but if you could connect us with someone who is about to make a payment for the same seat, that may work well for everyone.
22/09/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 247 9571: This is my response
22/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Good afternoon I was facing network challenges
26/09/23, 9:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kelly!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/09/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response on this please. On that note, I would like to mention that if you wish transfer your seat to another student, that student should be a connection of yours, otherwise, the transfer option is not applicable on the same. I hope you understand this?
27/09/23, 9:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kelly!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/09/23, 9:13 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you have taken a note of the message that I had shared here please?

I hope you are doing well today.
27/09/23, 11:13 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, can you please share your thoughts on the same as well?
27/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Good afternoon, it's going to be difficult to find the person to the person
28/09/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kelly!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, it can be hard for you to find a person, however, since this is the only way to get a refund, in that case, you would have to do that.
02/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 247 9571: Good afternoon @919540716843 I hope you are doing well. We are failing to find someone who can take the seat, can you please help on that.

09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kelly!
I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.
