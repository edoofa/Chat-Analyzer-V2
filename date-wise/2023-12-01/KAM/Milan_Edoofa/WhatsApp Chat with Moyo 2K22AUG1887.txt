21/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 497 1593: You first register in the Edoofa programme and attend every session  and then you pay the 200us dollars within a week after found elligible for the scholarship.Then you get to receive a statement of purpose to fill your understanding and your opinion about your sessions, you get counselled  in order for the preparation for me to be registered in the universities.You receive a letter from the university that is an acceptance letter showing that you are elligibke to be part of the Edoofians.

All good.
21/10/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand.

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 497 1593: Wow
Okay that is great ma'am
21/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 497 1593: That sound good ma'am
21/10/23, 11:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/10/23, 11:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 11:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/10/23, 11:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/10/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 497 1593: And thats great
21/10/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Do nform me once you have reviewed these benefits
21/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 497 1593: Yes I am done ma'am
21/10/23, 11:35 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 11:35 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the studentsA-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
21/10/23, 11:35 am - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Moyo, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 497 1593: Okay I understand ma'am
21/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 497 1593: Wow thats awesome ma'am
I can't wait
21/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 11:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
21/10/23, 10:18 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Okay ma'am I am sorry I got busy and I did not get time to respond 
I am writing my exams on Monday.
21/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Okay okay thats great
21/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Yes ma'am
23/10/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Moyo,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
25/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Moyo,

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
27/10/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Moyo,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
27/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Yes ma'am
27/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
27/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Yes ma'am
Very clear.
27/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Okay that's really amazing!
27/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Yes ma'am it really does
27/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/10/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Greetings ma'am
30/10/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Yes ma'am lets do it
30/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
01/11/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moyo.

I hope you are doing well. I couldn't help but notice that we have not been able to have a smooth conversation for the past few days and delays are Moyo's scholarship application, please I would encourage you to be transparent with us, and let us know if there are some kind of challenges that you are facing?
01/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 497 1593: How are you ma'am
The problem is I am writing my examinations so I will be reading most of the times and I get online to just learn,  then i dont get anytime to respond maam
01/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I understand and that is why it is alright, for your parents to attend the sessions on your behalf, please.
01/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing from you, but considering that it has been a long day for me and our working hours have now ended, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow. I hope you'll be available then.
02/11/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moyo.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you for a while now but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. In our past conversation, you wanted to start with the discussion hence I am curious to know what happened all of a sudden that has led to your inactivity in the admissions group. If you are not going to be transparent with us regarding the concerns you are dealing with, I may not be able to help you here, please I would appreciate you communicate with us, if you think that you will not be able to share your concern in the group we can discuss over the personal window as well?
03/11/23, 11:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. I was hoping to get a response from you, however, since it is past our available hours now. I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 01:30 p.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
04/11/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moyo.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I've managed to conclude my work engagements sooner than anticipated today and was wondering if this might be a convenient time for you to engage in a discussion with us?
04/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. As our available hours for Saturday are over we will be connecting with you on Monday. Have a great day and weekend ahead.
06/11/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 497 1593: Greetings ma'am
06/11/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moyo

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation on Saturday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 497 1593: How are you doing ma'am
Yes I am available now
06/11/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great and I am glad to know that you are available now. May I know if you are clear so far?
06/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Yes ma'am very clear we can continue.
06/11/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 497 1593: I do understand but I would really love you to expagorate further a bit
06/11/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
06/11/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
06/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Wow thats amazing ma'am I fully understand it now
No queries at all
06/11/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
06/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Yes that's right because it is way below standard especially for an A level student
06/11/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
06/11/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263784971593 may I know if we are still connected with each other?
06/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263784971593 I was hoping to get a response from you, may I know if we are still connected with each other?

07/11/23, 11:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to reconnect again tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/11/23, 10:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 497 1593: Ooooh okay that's wonderful ma'am
I understand loud and clear
09/11/23, 10:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
09/11/23, 10:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 497 1593: Yes ma'am very clear
09/11/23, 10:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 497 1593: Ooooh okay but that will be a stupid decision for a student who have  reached A level ....we should not give up as youths because we are supposed to set a good example for the second generation.
09/11/23, 10:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that, however, it is our responsibility to share the added benefit with you.
09/11/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 497 1593: Okay ma'am I get it
09/11/23, 10:53 am - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 497 1593: No ma'am I understood everything.
Thank you
09/11/23, 10:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
09/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 497 1593: Wow , thats amazing I am really excited ma'am
09/11/23, 10:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
09/11/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 497 1593: Thank you so much ma'am. I'm really happy .
09/11/23, 11:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
17/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 497 1593: Greetings ma'am
17/11/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moyo.

I hope you are doing well. May I know if you wish to share any thoughts of concerns?
17/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 497 1593: How are you ma'am
We are fine
17/11/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am doing great, thank you for asking, and I am glad to hear that you are doing fine as well.
17/11/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 497 1593: Yes ma'am
17/11/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Moyo,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/11/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

17/11/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 6:14 am - +27 64 128 8442: Good morning
Thank you so much
18/11/23, 6:47 am - +263 78 497 1593: Wow thank you so much ma'am
18/11/23, 8:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Moyo.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to know that you have acknowledged the letter and you are most welcome. I am looking forward to connecting with you today at 06:00 pm.
18/11/23, 8:32 am - +27 64 128 8442: No problem
18/11/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 497 1593: Okay ma'am
Thank you again.
18/11/23, 6:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Moyo!
I trust you are doing well.

I am Mr. Milan Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/11/23, 6:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/11/23, 6:17 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Good day sir, I did go through the letter yesterday.
Thank you once again
18/11/23, 6:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 6:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 6:28 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Okay no problem you can proceed and explain to me, I think Nokwakha is having network problems
18/11/23, 6:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 6:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 7:02 pm - +27 64 128 8442: 1..900 USD
2..5 years
3..Admission procedure fee.. 1800 USD**
4..Registration fee 750USD
18/11/23, 7:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 7:06 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Instead of $1800. The student has to pay $900?
18/11/23, 7:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well here, may you please come again what is it that you wish to ask here?
18/11/23, 7:11 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Registration fee remains at $750?
In our last year discussion we were told that the registration fee will be $600
18/11/23, 7:14 pm - +27 64 128 8442: What I mean is that the student won't pay 1800, but 900 or this amount gets to be divided into two semesters.
18/11/23, 7:14 pm - +27 64 128 8442: It's a question
18/11/23, 7:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right. The student would have to pay $900 per semester after the scholarship, this means that the total per annum fee is $1900 please. Now, coming to the second query of yours we will be discussing more about the registration fee moving ahead during our discussion. I hope you this is understood?
18/11/23, 7:26 pm - +27 64 128 8442: I now understand
18/11/23, 7:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 7:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 7:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 7:37 pm - +27 64 128 8442: I do fully understand, hopefully Nokwakha will also understand
18/11/23, 7:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 7:39 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Yes it does
18/11/23, 7:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 7:47 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Yes I am
18/11/23, 7:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 7:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 7:58 pm - +27 64 128 8442: As of the 1st of December, I don't have this amount of money, I thought the registration will be done around April 2024 because I'm the only one currently working and taking care of all my children
18/11/23, 7:58 pm - +27 64 128 8442: I just finished paying their primary and high school fees last week
18/11/23, 8:00 pm - +27 64 128 8442: So $750 is R15 000 thas a lot of cash
18/11/23, 8:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for sharing the same with me here. On that note, I would like to mention that for now, let us focus on completing the discussion about the offer letter here and then we will move ahead to discuss this concern of yours. I hope you are okay with that?
18/11/23, 8:19 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Okay we can do that
18/11/23, 8:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 8:21 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Yes please
18/11/23, 8:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 8:38 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Okay I hear you sir, but as of now, meaning the month of December and January, only if a miracle from God happens then I will be able to pay the 600
18/11/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, we will surely discuss on that and stay assured that I'm here to help you with that too. I hope you would also cooperate with me on that, right?
18/11/23, 8:45 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Yes because I want the best for my daughter
18/11/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, this payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 8:54 pm - +27 64 128 8442: I do understand everything the only problem is that that amount is currently not there
18/11/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, plesase. However, as I have already mentioned, let us aim towards completing the discussion here so that we can discuss on that matter moving ahead. I hope you would also want that, right?
18/11/23, 9:55 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Yes
18/11/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, since my working hours for the day are now over and it is late on my end here, we would be concluding our discussion for now. I appreciate your active participation and cooperation in going through the offer letter details.

Let's reconnect with each other here on Monday at 12.00 PM CAT to continue with our conversation. Until then, have a blessed day ahead, and if you have any immediate concerns, don't hesitate to leave a message here. Thank you and take care.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter?
21/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 497 1593: No problem sir lets continue
21/11/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Moving ahead, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed with our discussion here?
22/11/23, 7:05 am - +263 78 497 1593: Good morning Sir
22/11/23, 8:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Moyo!
I trust this message finds you well. I hope you've had a good start to your day.

Regrettably, our conversation was interrupted yesterday before we could conclude our discussion. As we weren't able to finish our conversation, I'm reaching out to ask if we can reconnect here now to continue where we left off and proceed with our discussion regarding the offer letter?
22/11/23, 8:17 am - +263 78 497 1593: Yes sir
22/11/23, 8:19 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please! Moving ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please so that we can move ahead?
22/11/23, 8:19 am - +263 78 497 1593: Yes Sir, very clear
22/11/23, 8:21 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/11/23, 8:21 am - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/11/23, 8:22 am - +263 78 497 1593: Ooooh okay I understand
22/11/23, 8:22 am - +263 78 497 1593: No Sir, in Bulawayo
22/11/23, 8:23 am - +27 64 128 8442: Good morning sir
22/11/23, 8:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/11/23, 8:23 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/11/23, 8:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/11/23, 8:23 am - +27 64 128 8442: I'm in South Africa
22/11/23, 8:24 am - +27 64 128 8442: Last time when I paid using the rand
22/11/23, 8:26 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that. Alternatively, if you wish to make the payment from South Africa in Rands, in that case, I believe the most feasible mode for you would be to use Mama Money, right?
22/11/23, 8:28 am - +27 64 128 8442: I used the Mama Money and I helped by Madam Rockson
22/11/23, 8:33 am - +27 64 128 8442: *** I paid using the rand
22/11/23, 8:38 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, what you can do is you can use the same mode of payment, i.e. Mama Money for making hte payment of your registration fee. For that, once you are ready to make the payment, you can let us know a day before you are planning to make the payment so that we ca nget the order generated for you. I hope this is clear?
22/11/23, 8:59 am - +27 64 128 8442: It is clear
22/11/23, 9:00 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

22/11/23, 9:08 am - +27 64 128 8442: Thank you
22/11/23, 9:11 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
22/11/23, 9:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
22/11/23, 9:12 am - Milan Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
22/11/23, 9:12 am - Milan Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
22/11/23, 10:16 am - +27 64 128 8442: In the last year conversation we were told that a student will be earning $5000 a month of which a student will manage to be paying for themselves
22/11/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. While on that, note, I would like to mention that it could be possible to do that, however, it does not seem realistic as of now. 

Along with that, may you please let me know when was it mentioned?
22/11/23, 10:25 am - +27 64 128 8442: Before I did the $200 payment, I no longer have the charts because my phone once crushed
22/11/23, 10:28 am - +27 64 128 8442: I was told that we will have to pay the 200us for her first then 600 for her to be enrolled at the university after that she will manage because she will be getting cash
22/11/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. Moving ahead, I would like to mention that you must have misunderstood what the counselor wanted to say. I am sure it must have been mentioned that the $200 that you had paid at first was for your enrollment fee to make you a part of the Edoofa Program. This gave you access to the scholarship program, EWYL Program, the counseling session, admission process guidance, etc.
22/11/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Along with this, when it comes to the registration fee of $600 as well, I'm sure that it must have been mentioned that the fee is $500-750, not $600, right?
22/11/23, 11:03 am - +27 64 128 8442: I knew about 750 of which I pay 600 and 150 will come from edoofa
22/11/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is absolutely right. With that said, shall we now move ahead with our discussion ahead?
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - +27 64 128 8442: Yes
22/11/23, 12:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we do that, may I know if you are clear till here please?
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Moyo!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/11/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter, may I know by when can we reconnect with each other so that we can proceed to the next part of our discussion and complete the same?
28/11/23, 7:18 am - +263 78 497 1593: Good morning Sir
28/11/23, 8:21 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Moyo!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 8:23 am - Milan Edoofa: It's been over five days since we last connected regarding your offer letter and the next steps in your admission journey. I understand that life can get busy, however, since I did not get any response from your side I was concerned about the same. 

May I know if everything is fine at your end and if you would be able to connect with me here today in order to continue with our discussions regarding your admission process as well as the next steps?
28/11/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 497 1593: Yes Sir we are doing good thank you.
28/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 497 1593: Everything is fine Sir,  we are just having financial problems because my mom is the only one working and my dad is not working for now.....We are not going to afford this amount of money within 15days Sir.
28/11/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that. In that case, may you please let me know how are you planning to move ahead with your admission process?
28/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 497 1593: We were planning to reconsider Sir because there is no other alternative for us to find such money🥹
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, let us say that you are now finding it hard to raise the required money, then how will you be moving ahead with Moyo's higher education?
28/11/23, 8:30 pm - +27 64 128 8442: We will look for less paying universities the ones we will afford
28/11/23, 8:30 pm - +27 64 128 8442: *where I will afford
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Moyo!
