13/09/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. We shall connect at the said time frame.
13/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Thank you
14/09/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Anushka. How are you doing this lovely evening?
15/09/23, 6:04 am - +263 77 794 0837: We are very fine. How are you sir
15/09/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and name. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I am great, Thank you for asking.
15/09/23, 2:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
15/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Good evening sir. Sorry for the late reply.
15/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 794 0837: An offer letter is a formal document that outlines the terms and conditions offered to a candidate who has been selected for an enrollment at a college or university
15/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
17/09/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 794 0837: Yes
18/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
18/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Pleasee lt me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
18/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Yes I have
18/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
18/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
18/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Yes sir
18/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/09/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Yes it does
18/09/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/09/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Yes sir
18/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/09/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 18, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 18, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 18, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Ok
18/09/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/09/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is late and it has been a long day for me, and the available hours are coming to an end, we shall proceed with our session tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM. I hope this works for you, and have a great night.
19/09/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 241 8135: May you please provide me with more information
19/09/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Anushka,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely afternoon?
20/09/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today and  I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
20/09/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Good evening sir. Thank you we will be in touch
21/09/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Good afternoon sir. We are really fine
21/09/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Yes
21/09/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/09/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 794 0837: May you please provide with more information
21/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
21/09/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
21/09/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
21/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 794 0837: OK noted sir thank you
21/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
21/09/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Yes
21/09/23, 5:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
21/09/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Yes
21/09/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
21/09/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
21/09/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Yes its now clear
21/09/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
21/09/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/09/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Yes
21/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/09/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today. Hence, I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
21/09/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Thank you Sir but I want clarification on the above matter.Does this only applies to those who have registered  early like what you mentioned. And  what will happen to those who have failed to register before results are out
22/09/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

22/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Good evening. Noted. Thank you
25/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

16/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Yes

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
03/11/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
04/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
04/11/23, 1:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are still connected with us and ready for this session so that we can proceed with the session and hopefully complete our discussion in due time.@263782418135

04/11/23, 1:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Please let me know if you were able to go through the above message here as well?

04/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398

04/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Ok sor
04/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 241 8135: sir
04/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Yes i was
04/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000
04/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Understood
04/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 241 8135: I have a question
04/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please ask. I am more than happy to assist you.
04/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Is Galgotias the only University that has accepted me?
04/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As of now, your application has been accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I hope we are together with this?
04/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. I was hoping for further replies from you so that we could proceed further and complete the discussion for the day.

However, as much as I would like to wait and proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on Monday from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Ok sir understood
04/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 241 8135: Thank you. Same to you
06/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Anushka!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues.

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As much as I would like to wait and proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as itt is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 8:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/11/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Dear Parents and Anushka, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

On that positive note, I am here to continue with our session for your prestigious offer letter from Galgotias University.

Shall we begin?
07/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Good evening. Yes you can go ahead
07/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 350 5187: However network might be a challenge since we do not have electricity but we will try our best
07/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 350 5187: We are having electricity challenges nationwide
07/11/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about the electricity challenges. I understand that this can be a common issue, and I appreciate your efforts to stay connected.

Let's make the best of our session given the circumstances. If there are any interruptions or if the network becomes unstable, please don't worry. With that said, shall we proceed with the session?
07/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 794 0837: Yes sir
07/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you now understand the previous message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
07/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
07/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
07/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Yes you can proceed
07/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for, now with this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
07/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $3000. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $3000 - $1000 = $2000, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians. <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
07/11/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 350 5187: May I have some clarity here Sir. So does it mean that as Edoofa the EWYL is the only assistance that a student can get after being enrolled or there is more? <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad you asked for clarification, and it's an excellent question. The EWYL Program is one of the ways Edoofa supports students in making their education more affordable, but it's not the only form of assistance available.

In addition to the EWYL Program, Edoofa offers various other forms of support, including:

Guidance and Mentoring: Edoofa offers guidance and mentoring to help students succeed academically and in their future careers.
07/11/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please do let me know if we are on the same page here?
07/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Yes I understand now
07/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
07/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
07/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 350 5187: So is it possible for one to start the EWYL programme whilst still in Zim or can only be done when one is in India
07/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 350 5187: I think we can conclude if there is nothing more
07/11/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is indeed possible to start our EWYL session while you are in India. And I would like you to please connect with your mentor for that. 

May I know if you are in constant connection with your mentor, arent you dear?
07/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 350 5187: She is. Ok understood
07/11/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

07/11/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
07/11/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition).

As per our recent conversation that we had the previous day, I believe that you might have been able to have a conversation with Ms. Valerie regarding your higher education journey. I would also like to let you know that tomorrow marks the deadline of your first part of your university registration fees for your prestigious offer letter from Galgotias University.

Hence, I wanted to inquire about your preparation for the payment, and as your admission officer, I do not want any potential discrepancies that may lead to losing out on this offer letter. May I kindly ask about your preparation regarding the finances for the first part of your registration fee?
15/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 350 5187: How are you Sir. Its good that you are concerned about our preparation in as far as the first payment of our child's fees is concerned. However, currently we are unable to make the payment due to financial challenges.

15/11/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that financial constraints can be challenging, especially when managing existing loans along with other expenses. It's crucial to prioritize and plan finances effectively.

15/11/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In addition to that may I know if you have made any plans to gather the payment for you first part as It would be required to retain your offer letter from the university.
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Yes that is what we have been doing all along but all was in vain. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand the challenges you are facing, and I appreciate your efforts in trying to gather the necessary funds. As your admission officer, I would not like to lose out on the offer letter. Hence, I would like to ask how much you will be willing to gather for Anushka's registration fees to retain this offer letter. This way, I can update the university and inform them about the situation.
16/11/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon dear parents and Anushka.
16/11/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am hoping to receive a response from your end regarding my previous message aimed at assisting you in this situation. It appears that the message was left unattended despite being seen. To assist you, I wanted to inquire about your enthusiasm in November 2022 regarding the enrollment in the Edoofa program and your thorough understanding of the associated fees and costs. Considering it has been a considerable amount of time since then, could you confirm whether you have made any financial preparations or savings for your child's higher education journey?
16/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Good afternoon. Yes I read your last chat and we had already given up this time around since today is the due day and we have not yet paid anything. Which wil mean will have to re organise ourselves and come back to you
16/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's understandable how challenging this situation might feel with the due date looming. May I know how are you planning to reorganise for the same?
16/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Ok Sir
16/11/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges with my above messages?
17/11/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear. I was inquiring about how are you planning to reorganize for the same?
17/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 350 5187: We are ok Sir. Ok is there any chances of admission this time around or we have to wait for next time since the due date lapsed?
17/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since you are okay now. May I know if you might be able to make the payment anytime soon?

As I am having a meeting with the academic board tomorrow I shall be able to bring up this topic regarding the extension of the deadline. So if you are ready to make the payment anytime soon in these couple of days. Please let me know.
17/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Well I will let you know cause we need a little bit of time to re-organise and see if we can make it <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 9:09 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Anushka. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I understand the need for some time to reorganize and evaluate the possibility of making the payment. Take the necessary time you require, and when you have a clearer idea or decision. But for me to give the board an answer may I know by when you might be bale to make the payment? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Anushka. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was hoping for a response from your end, but it seems that my messages might have been overlooked. I wanted to discuss in detail the finances you are concerned about, aiming to provide you with the best solution for your university admission process. As your admission officer, it is my sole responsibility to assist in securing your higher education aspirations, providing exposure, experience, and unique skill sets. If you're receiving my message, please let me know so that we can have a discussion on this matter.
24/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 350 5187: Morning morning Sir. Yes we saw your message and as it is right now we are not in a position to answer all the questions that you are asking us. Currently we are re-organising ourselves so that when we come back to you we will have the best answer or option to take. End of year situations are the most difficulty ones here in Zim coz we will be having a lot of things that needs financial attention hence if one cancels one of the projects it means it will take time to re- consider it. That is the current situation that we are in right now. We value your concern Sir and we thank you for that.
24/11/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 350 5187: We missed the 15 days deadline so we need to re-organise so that when we come back to you everything will be alright.
24/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for taking the time to update me on the challenges you're currently facing. I understand that you have a lot on your plate, especially with year-end financial commitments. It's completely reasonable to need time to reassess and reorganize priorities, especially when juggling multiple demanding projects. While the university admission process is crucial, managing everything within the available resources is equally important.
24/11/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As your admission officer, I'm here to assist you. I'm willing to discuss with the university officials regarding an extension. However, as the scholarship opportunities are limited and many international students are applying, a 15-day extension might not be feasible. Nevertheless, I'd like to inquire about the amount you can gather by the end of this month, specifically by the 30th of November. If you could provide me with this information, it would help me assure the university officials that you're committed to payment and help you retain this offer letter. Can you please share these details with me?
29/11/23, 5:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Anushka. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

As your admission officer, I have worked my best to extend your offer letter until the end of this month to make you retain this letter and secure your seat. Hence, I would like to give you good news that your university has extended the deadline until the end of this month, which is tomorrow, and after that, they will be closing the round of applications for this month. If you happen to miss this, I am afraid I won't be able to help you out and you would lose out on this opportunity. 

But for this, I would also need your help. Hence, could you please provide me with an update on the minimum amount that you were able to gather for your registration fees to meet the deadline for tomorrow and we can discuss the remaining amount next month?

Giving this update to the university officials will help me convince them to secure the seat for you so that she can be a part of your friends coming to India for their dream.
29/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Good evening Sir. We appreciate your efforts in trying to help our child to secure a seat/ place at the University. However like what I said the other day that we need time to reorganise ourselves so that we can gather the monies needed for the first payement we havent managed to raise any so far. Our monies only comes once that is on the pay day hence if that passes it will need another month which obviously impossible to wait that long
29/11/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your update and your honesty regarding the current financial situation. I completely understand the constraints your family is facing. Managing finances around specific deadlines can indeed be challenging, especially when the timing doesn't align with your pay schedule. May I ask, if you don't mind, since we are already expecting the arrival of this letter, have you not made any savings for Anushka's higher education?
29/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 350 5187: Thank you for the good question. The situation here in Zim is different from some other countries. How? Its difficulty to make some savings like that. Normaly its our pay that goes straight to pay fees for all the children that we have hence we have to balance these things so that every child do benefit accordingly.
29/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. I understand your situation. I was not able to connect with you further. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
30/11/23, 5:51 am - +263 77 350 5187: Thank you
