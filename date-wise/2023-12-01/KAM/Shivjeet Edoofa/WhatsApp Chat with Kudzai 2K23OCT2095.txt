I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
30/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Affordability through guaranteed scholarship

I have admired this aspect because through acceptance of a student in the Edoofa Program a candidate is guaranteed with a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fees . This enables one to complete his or her career in India therefore this proves the affordability of studying in India through Edoofa Scholarship Program

02/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Greetings to you Sir 

We are all great and yourself 
Happy belated birthday to you Sir
02/11/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great too, thank you for asking, and the warm wish it means a lot to me. May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
02/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Yes ,l did Sir
02/11/23, 5:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
02/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir
02/11/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I shall wait for the same
02/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 888 5077: I heard that the Edoofa Program is there to help students to live the lives of their dreams .
It is not only an affordable quality education but it is also there to make the students employable ,increasing students capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent

It is also a program which invested 10 years working into creating the platform ,choosing the best colleges and universities to work with .
 It is a program which is different from Agents who are there to acquire money ,have no knowledge about the certain universities or schools , they don't even know the type of education that will be given to the students , This means the Agents have no care ,they are only there for businesses and money 

Edoofa will also help student to have necessary knowledge about the requirements of an employer, because it is very useless for one to hold a certificate in your hands without skills and knowledge

There is this example that l enjoyed the most that Edoofa is there to increase the capacity of amount of success to students  for example being filled from a cup to a tank
02/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Lastly the founders  of Edoofa are also there to encourage students to follow instructions as to prepare and be qualified for the prestigious institutions
02/11/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
02/11/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
02/11/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
02/11/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
02/11/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
02/11/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Very true , l understood all the Videos Sir
02/11/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
02/11/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
02/11/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

03/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Question 2 . Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil Rights ?


Rights refer to entitlements or freedoms that individuals possess , granting them certain benefits or protections whilst Duties are the moral or legal obligations individuals have towards others or society .

Examples of Rights include the right to life , liberty and equality whilst examples of duties are duty to obey laws , to pay taxes and to contribute to the well being of the society .

Human Rights refers to the fundamental rights and freedoms that every individual is entitled to have by virtue of their inherent dignity and without discrimination whilst Civil Rights are specific and protections that are granted and guaranteed by a particular country's legal system.

Human rights are generally considered universal and applicable to all individuals regardless of their nationality or citizenship  while civil rights may vary from one county to another based on legal systems and cultural context .

Examples of human rights are right to life ,right to health and the right to freedom from torture whilst examples of the Civil Rights are right to vote and the right to public education .
03/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Question 3 What is the difference between Prosecutor and an Attorney ?

A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in  criminal cases ,he or she can  gather  evidence , interview , witnesses and presents the cases in court and advocate for the government's position whilst an Attorney is a legal professional lawyer who provides legal advices , guidance and a  representative to individuals, business or organisations . Attorneys can also negotiate settlements , draft legal documents and provide legal guidance and advocacy in various legal matters 
Attorneys are more specialized in laws such as Criminal,civil , Corporate, family and intellectual property laws.

In summary a prosecutor represents the government in criminal cases while an attorney represents individual or entities in a wide range of legal matters .
03/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Question 4 Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing , Civil, Corporate or Criminal and why ? 

I am most interested in pursuing the Corporate law branch because this branch has got more Career Opportunities and financial rewards . Corporate law provides numerous career opportunities including law firms , inhouse legal departments of corporations or as legal consultants.These position often come with high salaries and opportunities for advancement.

To add, Corporate law has connections to businesses and commerce . It intersects with various aspects of business and commerce allowing me Kudzai as an upcoming lawyer to work closely with entrepreneurs , executives and decision makers .It also help me to understand the legal aspects of businesses transactions. 

Furthermore, the Corporate law has got job stability and job market demand .It is a stable and in a demand field law so this will help me as a Corporate lawyer to ensure a consistent demand for corporate lawyers .

2 l do believe that l have excellent communication skills because clear and concise communication is very important for me to be a successful lawyer 
For example  As a lawyer presenting a case in a court l have to articulate the arguments persuasively and have communication complex legals to the judge or jury .

3 l do believe that l have analytical and critical thinking skills . As a lawyer l have to think critically to identify relevant legal precedents and apply them to specific cases so that l will be a successful lawyer . For example as a lawyer when l am going preparing a legal brief l have to be careful when analyzing relevant laws and judicial decisions to build a very strong legal argument for my clients .

Lastly l do believe that l have problem solving abilities for example as a lawyer l will be encountering complex legal problems that requires me to be innovative and to be a problem solver . I must assess situations , identify potential legal issues and develop appropriate solutions therefore this indicates my successfulness in this law Program .

03/11/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/EOjqQ6qIFuW0TbspuVXBzM

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
03/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Good afternoon Sir Shivjeet ,we are all blessed
03/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Well noted
03/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student. I hope you are having a fine evening today. 

I would like to let you know that I will not be available this evening due to an unforeseen event that just came up, requiring my immediate attention. In order to make up for this session, I shall now be scheduling our session for tomorrow morning from 8:30 AM onwards. Please excuse me for the inconvenience. Have a great evening, and please share my warm regards with your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 888 5077: 100% accurate Sir
04/11/23, 12:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
04/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Yes Sir l am ready
04/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/11/23, 12:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses. <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 12:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Well noted Sir, yes it is not possible for a student to study at multiple universities
04/11/23, 12:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly. <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 12:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/11/23, 12:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Very correct Sir
04/11/23, 12:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 888 5077: I am following Sir
04/11/23, 1:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well.

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on Monday from 3:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 888 5077: You are most welcome Sir Shivjeet.Have a great weekend
04/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _Aditi   Kapoor ,she said that l will begin my EWYLP session on the 7th of November from 8:30 AM and l should be punctual
04/11/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the details of your EWYL session. Wishing you the best for your EWYL Journey.
04/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Thank you so much Sir
06/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues. 

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
06/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet

Indeed it is a motivational Monday for me. How do you do ! 

Yes l am ready to start the session
06/11/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
06/11/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you are ready. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
06/11/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
06/11/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
06/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Very well noted Sir
06/11/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
06/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir , lm following so does this mean that if l manage to pay maybe let me say $500 for registration fee  , the university's due date will it be after l send my final results or before
06/11/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university has already commenced with the admission process, and you will be provided with all the details as long as we proceed with the session. There are some exciting opportunities waiting for you. So, with that said, shall we proceed with the session?
06/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Yes Sir , you can  carry on
06/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
06/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
06/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
06/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Well explained Sir ,
06/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
06/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
06/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
06/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Wow ,this is Great
06/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir , lm listening
06/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
06/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
06/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
06/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Yes Sir ,l am ready
06/11/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/11/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
06/11/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
06/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 888 5077: I'm  done Sir
06/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
06/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
06/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
06/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Okay lm following
06/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright l get it Mr Shivjeet
06/11/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/11/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Yes Sir
06/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir, l am understanding .This is very clear
06/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Wow so this means this can be easy and done by an Edoofian only right
06/11/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct the above benefits are especially for Edoofians only.
06/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Noted Sir
06/11/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 888 5077: You can add more information Sir , so that l will keep it safe in my diary and read it anytime of the day
06/11/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
06/11/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
06/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright , this is great ✨
06/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
06/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 888 5077: I do agree
06/11/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
06/11/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Very clear
06/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
06/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?

06/11/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/11/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 337 2459: Alright we are following
17/11/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/11/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
17/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 888 5077: 1.$350
2.$0
3.$1600
4.$125
5.$1000
17/11/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
17/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 888 5077: This is fantastic indeed 😊
17/11/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
17/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Very well noted
17/11/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1350.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1350 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1600.
 
It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1350. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
17/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 888 5077: You are nailing it Sir , l am now understanding this  letter
17/11/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
17/11/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir, this is great
17/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 888 5077: I'm done
17/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.
17/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
17/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 888 5077: This is true
17/11/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1350. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1350 - $1000 = $350, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 337 2459: Thank you Sir l am now aware of this EWYL program .
17/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 337 2459: This will sound great to us as family to pay the other annual fee part Sir
17/11/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/11/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
17/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir, l am following this means that will be left with paying $500 after paying the registration fee of $1000 . Am l correct ?
17/11/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is spot on and Absolutely correct!. Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,600. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,600 - $1,000 = $600 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well? <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Very well noted
17/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Very clear
17/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: There is a small correction here. The fees mentioned here are supposed to be $1600 instead of $1500. Please let me know if you are clear on this, dear?
17/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir thank you for the correction , everything is clear
17/11/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that now. Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 30th, 2023*.
17/11/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Yes Sir , you can proceed
17/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before *November 30th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir l am following . I have a question Sir , My question goes like this my parents are with paying $150   of the enrollment fee and they are paying it before 30th of November  . So l am not understanding about the grant fee . Does this mean that they have to pay the left enrollment fee + grant fee so that my registration fee will be paid in two instalments . Am l correct or l am lost ?
17/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 888 5077: * my parents are left with
17/11/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, Let me help you here kudzai. See the Registration fee is of $1000 and you have a grant of $150 Form the Endowment which comes at a balance of $850 for your registration fees.
17/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This registration fees is split into two parts of $425 each with different deadlines, also can be paid in one shot which is $800. With the respective deadlines given above. May I know if you are clear here ?
17/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir, very clear
17/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Very sorry Sir with late responses l don't know what's going on with our phones . Network is tripping
17/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Yes Sir we stay in Harare
17/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir, thank you so much .My parents will see all of these messages
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir, l didn't see food expenses what will do if l manage to be one of the students at MVN University
17/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with the food here. The university will provide you with the opportunity to cook your own food at your accommodation, which means you have the liberty to eat your home-cooked meals. It will cost the students a monthly expense of $40 to $50 to gather groceries or even sometimes order food from outside the university, giving you affordability and convenience too. I hope I am clear on this?
17/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 888 5077: Alright Sir, thank you for clarification
17/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
