21/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents Shyleen!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
21/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 336 8037: Thank you for the bittersweet update sir Milan, I wish you all the best ...
22/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!.

I hope you're having a fine evening today. I am Mr. Shivjeet, your admission officer starting today. I would like to inform you that I will be taking over your session for the admission process, as Mr. Milan has been assigned to a new role as informed to you. I am pleased to let you know that he will be there upon your arrival in India to guide you through the university and you will be meeting him in person.

With that said our team has dedicated considerable time to refine and enhance your upcoming educational journey for 2025. We've honed in on an improved approach and I'm excited to share these insights with you. Let's delve into the details together tomorrow at 6:00 PM. In the meantime, please take a look at the insights provided to you. Have a great night and my warm wishes to your lovely family.
22/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Why the EDOOFA SECURE PLAN?*

Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

In summary, an Edoofa Secure Plan is a critical financial tool for parents with their children entering university soon. It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship.
22/11/23, 10:54 pm - +263 78 909 8049: evening to you too sir
22/11/23, 10:55 pm - +263 78 909 8049: noted sir
23/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Shyleen!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. With regard to my above message, I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 554 0651: Thanks good evening to you Sir
23/11/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, could you please let me know if you were able to go through the above points that I shared with you the previous day?
23/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 909 8049: hello sir ...we can proceed
23/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 909 8049: yes we went through them
23/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Let me share with you how the Edoofa Secure Plan would work. I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you are asked to pay is $350, right?
23/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 909 8049: yes am aware
23/11/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Okay, so from the $350, you have already paid $200 and the balance $150 is due, right?
23/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 909 8049: yes sir am yet to complete the $150 balance
23/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, based on our experience of over 14 years and after helping over 5000 students from different countries, what we have realized is financial planning is the most important factor when we think about higher education abroad. And to help the students and parents with that, the Edoofa Management has come up with a financially secure plan that will help you plan for your child’s higher education without stress and last-minute rush.
23/11/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Over the last 7 years, we have seen that 20-30% of students who take admission are unable to come to India because of lack of financial planning. The money required to book flights, and pay for accommodation and food after arrival is something that takes a toll and they are unable to send the child in that year and decide to defer the admission which creates a gap in education for the child. So, the Edoofa Secure Plan will reduce the financial pressure and smoothen the journey of sending your child to India.
23/11/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are in the month of November 2023 now and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for the finances. As you have been informed during the counseling session that we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees, the cost of education including the food, accommodation would be between $1200-$1800 and can even be less as well but not more, which means if you are able to save $150 per month for the next 20 months you will be able to save $3000 which is more than enough for the first year university fee which includes tuition fees (if any), food and accommodation.
23/11/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That means by the time your child will be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first year fee. Now, in these 20 months, I am sure the child will also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if the child secures to earn a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years is already secured. Now, for a 3 year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 year, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent is easy and smooth. Do you agree to this?
23/11/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 909 8049: agreed sir
23/11/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 336 8037: Wow,yes I agree with what you are saying sir
23/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 554 0651: Yes I did
23/11/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 2:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
23/11/23, 9:47 pm - +263 71 554 0651: Yes
23/11/23, 9:58 pm - +263 71 554 0651: That will help yes thanks for sharing

27/11/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, also, there is another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates. If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 5000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different. Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, mugging everyday. And in that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank requires a Nostro Account which means you have to pay to the bank to keep your money safe, right?
27/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 336 8037: That's true
27/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 909 8049: yes thats true sir
27/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Let me explain how:

Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months. Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
27/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 909 8049: yes sir 🤔
27/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 336 8037: Wow ,okay .....it sounds good
27/11/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 5:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 909 8049: noted thank you
