*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

18/10/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

18/10/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?

18/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

18/11/23, 11:10 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 11:10 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 927 7809: 1 $1800
2 3years
3 $300
4$750
18/11/23, 11:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if the answer to question 1 is correct?
18/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 927 7809: Sorry its $900
18/11/23, 11:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 71 927 7809: Yes it does
18/11/23, 11:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 11:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 11:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Noted
18/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Yes I understand it sounds like a great place
18/11/23, 12:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes it is and I am happy to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Yes let's move on
18/11/23, 12:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 12:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 1st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon a little early as it is the weekend here. So, let us connect on Monday from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great weekend with tons of Fun, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 304 6238: Afternoon how are you
We are ready to start our program
20/11/23, 1:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 304 6238: Yes sir
20/11/23, 1:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/11/23, 1:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Is this money refundable if the scholarship fails
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely! The fees will be refunded to you if you are eligible based on the refund policy provided to you in your acceptance letter by the time of your enrollment. I hope you are clear here?
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Yes I understand
20/11/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/11/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 304 6238: Not in Harare but in Bulawayo
20/11/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/11/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/11/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer.

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied with a meeting with the team. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time to avoid any delay in your session so that you have free time to yourself.

21/11/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
23/11/23, 1:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afreroon dear parents and Tafadzwa!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. During the past couple of days, in our discussion of the offer letter, it has been noticed that there have been irregularities in our sessions, leading to a delay in discussing your offer letter. I understand that there might be some challenges that you are currently facing, which has led to this inconsistency, and as your admission officer, I am always ready to help you out here. If it's the timing of our session, you can also let me know so that we can schedule our session at your convenience to complete the discussion of your prestigious offer letter.
23/11/23, 1:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, as we continue to face these inconsistencies in our sessions, you may end up missing the deadline for the offer letter, potentially losing out on the same. If that happens, I would not be able to help you. I want you to secure this offer letter to make your future dreams come true, as it has been my sole responsibility since I became your admission officer. So, if you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that we can find a solution and proceed with the detailed discussion of the offer letter and plan your finances together.
23/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Noted will do so
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are now active to proceed with the sssion?
23/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Yes am
23/11/23, 1:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With further continuation. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
23/11/23, 1:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details.
23/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Thank u noted
23/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
23/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Noted
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Noted
23/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
23/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
23/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
23/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Yes it does
23/11/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
23/11/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
25/11/23, 8:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear Parents and Tafadzwa!

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping for a reply from your end to complete our letter discussion, but it seems that my message may have been overlooked. Allow me to share a tale - a student, much like yourself, embarking on a journey toward higher education abroad. Amidst the bustling days and nights, a pivotal document, the offer letter, stands as the gateway to this dream.

In earnest dedication, I've set aside extra hours this weekend, akin to an adventurer preparing diligently for an expedition, to ensure our conversation reaches its conclusion. Picture this discussion as a treasure map guiding you toward understanding the intricacies of your financial readiness. My sole aim in this quest is not just to secure the offer letter but to ensure a sturdy foundation for your aspirations, carving a path for a brighter future abroad. Your dreams are the compass; let's steer them toward reality together. So shall we proceed?

One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

25/11/23, 8:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
25/11/23, 8:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
25/11/23, 8:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise.

I hope you are doing well and feeling blessed. I wanted to let you know that I was not able to reach you yesterday and have a meaningful conversion as there were technical difficulties on our end. Hence, I would like to reach out to inquire about that. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require.

To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.

29/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening parent and my dear student!

As the university has set a deadline of December 1, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
29/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 71 927 7809: Noted
29/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you to get an update on the admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of your registration fee by Tomorrow, 1st December 2023. 

As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the preparation of the payment of your fee?
