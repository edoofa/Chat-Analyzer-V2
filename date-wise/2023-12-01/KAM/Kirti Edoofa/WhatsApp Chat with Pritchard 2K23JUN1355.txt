As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Pritchard's higher education?

17/10/23, 10:31 pm - +263 78 580 0065: <Media omitted>

17/10/23, 10:35 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Okay, that's fine;
18/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Pharmacy and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Yes ma'am, 
You have correct information,
18/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Yes during August 2024 I'm planning to arrive in India.
18/10/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Noted,
18/10/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 580 0065: After receiving your offer letter,  you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750 dollars. After paying the same  and for you to get a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance Letter.
18/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
18/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Before you stated that the registration fee is about $500 to $750,

Are you able to share the exact figure so that we prepare for the same,
18/10/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you understand, every university has its own registration fee, however, to be on a safer side we always suggest parents to prepare themselves with $750 amount, so that even if the fee is less the remaining amount can be used in further costs, I hope you are clear now?
18/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I understand,
18/10/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please.

01/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Pritchard.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great too. I understand your concern here. However. This is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
01/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Okay that's fine, I wanted  to ensure if we are on the same page  ...
You know we are  at the countryside,  so no access to a lot of internet,  that's the reason why I ask ma'am. 
Thank I understand what you shared.
01/11/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification, and I completely understand the challenges of limited internet access in the countryside. It's great that you're ensuring we are on the same page, and I'm here to assist you with every challenge you face, feel free to reach out to me whenever you want.

17/11/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Yes ma'am, we can go ahead,
I understand what you shared.
17/11/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
17/11/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
17/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 580 0065: 1. $1000
2. 0
3. $2250
4. $125
5.$1000
17/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 75% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
17/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 580 0065: So throughout the the duration you don't have any costs on tuition fees and accommodation. Alright?
17/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I want to understand if I get it correct.
17/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I want to know if I get it correct.
17/11/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please through out the duration he will not have any accommodation cost.
18/11/23, 5:13 am - +263 78 580 0065: Network connectivity is a challenge here.
18/11/23, 5:22 am - +263 78 580 0065: Good morning Ms.  Kirti,
Hope you're doing well. 

Yesterday we lost connection, I'm sorry with that, 
Network connectivity ended being a challenge  at our side
18/11/23, 5:28 am - +263 78 580 0065: I agree with you ma'am, this is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on my family.  I am thrilled to hear these good news .We are happy as family after receiving what you shared yesterday .
18/11/23, 8:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Pritchard.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. That is alright, please I understand that network can be a challenge and I am happy to hear that you were able to acknowledge the above message, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/11/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 580 0065: Yes ma'am, I am available
18/11/23, 9:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you are clear so far?
18/11/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 580 0065: I understand what you shared.
18/11/23, 9:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
18/11/23, 9:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $2250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $2500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $2250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
18/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 580 0065: I understand what you're sharing, Ms. Kirti.
18/11/23, 9:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
18/11/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 580 0065: What about health facilities?
18/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 580 0065: I understand?
18/11/23, 10:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Medical Health Insurance will be provided to you and all the students. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and can be obtained from the university itself. It would cost them $50 per annum, subject to yearly revision.

In the unfortunate event of a medical emergency during your higher education, this insurance ensures protection from the financial risks or uncertainties that may arise.
18/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 580 0065: I understand Ma'am,
18/11/23, 10:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2250, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 10:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
18/11/23, 10:35 am - +263 78 580 0065: I completely understand what you're sharing,
18/11/23, 10:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 10:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $2250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2250 - $1000 = $1250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 10:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 580 0065: I understand ma'am,
18/11/23, 11:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 11:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $2500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
18/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I understand that after paying the registration fee your remaining  fee which is to be paid after coming to India is $2500 -$1000 = $1500.
18/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I am ready to excel in the Earn While You Learn journey, 
I wish to have a top name amoung the other peers, I was working hard on my previous projects,
18/11/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am sure you will work even hard and I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,700 to $3,700 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
18/11/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $2250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2700 to $3700).
18/11/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
18/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I get the sense of what you're sharing with me,  
I am thrilled after receiving these good news. 
I want to just say "THANK YOU EDOOFA", I wish you to provide us with  even more opportunities in this way we can change our lives.
18/11/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words. In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier. <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
18/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I prefer one with higher registration fee, but have to know the figure so that I can check up with my family representative if she can pay that amount meeting the deadline date.
18/11/23, 12:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $2,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $2,500 - $1,000 = $1500 and is to be paid in two installments $750.
18/11/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, are we aligned on these options?
18/11/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Yes, we are on the same page.
18/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 30th, 2023*.
18/11/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Yes ma'am,
You can go ahead.
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 30, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 30, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 30, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Earlier you mentioned that we received the offer letter in advance, the university is mailing the official offer letter,
So my query comes here on the  deadline date, it will be 15 days from the date of issue of the official offer letter or we're just sticking to this we are discussing right now?
18/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I don't know if I'm clear here,
18/11/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand the letter we have shared is the same official letter from the university, their is no difference in the letter please, the university has many letters to generate and share plus their daily chores as well, hence they shared the letter with us so that we can share them with you on time.
18/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I understand now,
18/11/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I'm in Murambinda, it's a growth point .
18/11/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I understand ma'am,
So is it possible to use services like Mukuru?
18/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi Ecocash for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Yes ma'am,
Share with me the account details.
18/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here are the *Mukuru account details*

18/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 580 0065: The annual fee for the second year ($2250) is going to be paid how?
Can you make it clear here?
18/11/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can pay the annual fee $2250 in two installments of $1125 spaced within 6 months, plus with the help of of EWYL program you can early earn upto $1000 and reduce your fee further per year.

18/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Right now it seems like everything is clear.

18/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Specifically talking about myself, is it possible to find a job and secure my career path in India.

18/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond since today is Saturday and our available hours were ill 01:30 pm, however, I extended for you, since it is beyond my working hours now, I will be connecting with you on Monday have a great day and weekend ahead.
19/11/23, 12:51 am - +263 78 580 0065: I understand what you're sharing,
It's getting Clear .
19/11/23, 12:51 am - +263 78 580 0065: Connection is going wrong at our side,
 Kindly excuse me for that.
19/11/23, 12:53 am - +263 78 580 0065: Finally, I faced network challenges, we can proceed on Monday
20/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 580 0065: Good morning,
How are you doing?
20/11/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Pritchard!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
20/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Yes, we discussed about that.
20/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Firstly, as a family we are all happy and ready to embark on this new journey. It was an amazement  to encounter this greatly opportunity, to get such a higher education at that low cost in India is not child's play. My parents were also glad to know that I was presented with such an opportunity.  We all celebrated the same.
20/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Is  the annual fee paid to the university covers the costs of food? Or we look after our own food outside the university.
20/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I'm not sure here,
20/11/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not getting back to you sooner, I was occupied in a meeting. Let me help you understand your concern better. As per the breakup of the fee shared by MVN University, food is not included in the services offered by the university and hence is not mentioned in the list. For the food, students have several options. They can choose to get food from outside, cook for themselves, opt for a meal plan, or use the university's food services. Rest assured, the student will receive guidance to choose the option that suits them best. I hope with this, all the queries that you have been addressed?
21/11/23, 5:09 am - +263 78 580 0065: Good morning,
Hope you're doing well.
21/11/23, 5:09 am - +263 78 580 0065: I understand now,
21/11/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Pritchard,

I trust this message finds you in good health. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if we can connect now and continue with our discussion?
21/11/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Yes ma'am, we can continue with our discussion.
21/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Meanwhile, I want to ask if we can complete our initial payment of the registration fee.
21/11/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. We will get to that part of the discussion as well. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
22/11/23, 5:26 am - +263 78 580 0065: Greetings, I want to inform about the current network situation we have here in Buhera. Just after noon the network is going weak that we are not having active conservation online. Around 9:00 pm onwards it grows to click again.  I think this reputation is affecting us very much, I don't what we're gonna do.
22/11/23, 5:33 am - +263 78 580 0065: Not yet,
22/11/23, 5:36 am - +263 78 580 0065: It's only because of limited internet connection, if things stabilize I'm going carry that research.
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Pritchard.

I hope you are doing well. That is alright, please. Since we were unable to connect with you yesterday may I know if we can connect now and discuss further?
22/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Yes ma'am,
Did you managed to go through my past message?
22/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 580 0065: That's what we are facing here,
22/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 580 0065: We can discuss further,
22/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, Pritchard and I completely understand that it can cause a hindrance in our communication and it is alright, please. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.

22/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
22/11/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 30, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $425, or you can opt to pay the full $850 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
22/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I am opting  to make an initial payment of $450 before 30th November .
22/11/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
22/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I gave my dad a call a few minutes ago to discuss about that issue, 
Actually something disturbed the conversation, we are still considering our best option. 
I'm going to provide with the same once we're done.
22/11/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly. 

As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
22/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Right!
22/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
22/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
22/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I have a query with my parents here regarding the payment of the annual fee of $2250. 
I understood that this amount to the university is going to be Semester wise( 2 installments of 6 months each).
So $1125 in the first semester is paid how?
Do you do monthly payments of $187? Or the entire fee($1125) is paid  as per the tentative opening date of the first semester for the 2nd year.
22/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, let me help you. Ideally, the fees is to be paid at once for international students however, since you are enrolled through Edoofa you have the benefit of paying in two installments, now it depends upon the parents here if they wish to pay the first installment at once or on a monthly basis.
22/11/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I understand,
22/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Thank you,
22/11/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great evening ahead.
27/11/23, 8:00 am - +263 78 580 0065: Greetings of the day, 
I want to inform you that I am eager to complete my initial payment tomorrow. 
 
I prefer to use Mr Shorwi's payment method, so can I ask how much sum am i going to send to Mr Shorwi's account if the transfer charges amount to 12,5%.
It's confusing me right here, I didn't ask about that last time we talked, I thought someone would help me complete that payment, but actually  he's incapable of doing that.
27/11/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Pritchard.

I am sorry for not getting access to connect with you yesterday, something happened within us.

Now I want to inform that there was a slight change in plans, yesterday I managed to pass Mr Shorwi Kawadza  a figure $390 in form cash, I'm gonna  share the receipt today.
I'm about to deposit the other part in his account using Mukuru. So it could be around $45 if I'm not mistaken. 
Is this alright?
29/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Pritchard.

I hope you thank you for sharing the same with me, yes please you can certainly do that, and once you are done please share the receipts for both payments, please.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out with regard to our previous conversation as you were to make a deposit of the first part of Pritchard registration fee today so I would like to know how is your preparation going and if you have any updates to share with us?

30/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I gave Mr Shorwi a call, he said the  $390 is already transferred.
30/11/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263785800065 could you please confirm what mode of payment did you use for the $390?
30/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Greetings,
Mr Kawadza was handed the cash,
30/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation. However, your transfer charges as of 12.5 % are yet to be cleared although you can pay them by your next deadline, please. 

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
30/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 580 0065: You are going to clear transfer charges of 12.5% ...I'm not understanding what are you saying .
30/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand @263785800065 as I mentioned above since you made your deposit through Mr. Shorwi and the transfer charges are 12.5% you would be depositing a total of $478 for your first installment and as of now you have deposited a total of $435 only hence the remaining amount $43 is yet o be deposited and you can clear that with your next deadline.
30/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 580 0065: I thought: if the amount is submitted to Mr Shorwi in form of cash the transfer charges of that figure would be cleared off.That's what my dad said .

Thank you for letting us know that, we will try understanding each other here.
30/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, and you are welcome.
