I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Takudzwa's higher education?

21/10/23, 10:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*. <This message was edited>

25/10/23, 11:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
26/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
26/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/10/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/10/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Takudzwa, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please we can connect today at 09:00 pm, may I know if you will be available to connect by that time?
26/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect at 09:00 pm today,
26/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings with regard to our conversation may I know if you are ready to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright please, I understand, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Afternoon  . Yes  we can proceed
27/10/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied in a meeting, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Ok we can proceed
27/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Takudzwa,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
28/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Goodday . Sry  for not responding  earlier  but anyway we can connect even now if you are available
28/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 220 5689: May you also add this number 27837708100 thats for Takudzwa 's mom a South African  number.  I am  his mother's elder sister
01/11/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well. I couldn't help but notice that we have not been able to have a smooth conversation for the past few days and delays are affecting Takudzwa's scholarship application, please I would encourage you to be transparent with us, and let us know if there are some kind of challenges that you are facing? <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing from you, but considering that it has been a long day for me and our working hours have now ended, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow. I hope you'll be available then.
02/11/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you for a while now but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. In our past conversation, you wanted to start with the discussion hence I am curious to know what happened all of a sudden that has led to your inactivity in the admissions group. If you are not going to be transparent with us regarding the concerns you are dealing with, I may not be able to help you here, please I would appreciate you communicate with us, if you think that you will not be able to share your concern in the group we can discuss over the personal window as well @263772205689?
02/11/23, 2:30 pm - ~ Mai T added +27 83 770 8100
02/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Sorry  for not responding it has been a long story. There was a family  issue which needed my attention  so hope you  can  consider  my apology
02/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand, and there's no need to apologize. Family issues can be demanding and take priority in our lives. I hope everything is getting better now, and you were able to address the situation effectively. If you'd like to talk about it or share more, I'm here to listen please?
02/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 220 5689: For now it seems that there is less burden.  we can continue if you are ready
02/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. May I know if you are clear so far?
02/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Yeah we can proceed
02/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
02/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Yeah i understand
02/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
02/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
02/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
02/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 220 5689: No
02/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
02/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Yes ,may u update with more information
02/11/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
02/11/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
02/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Ok yes i see
02/11/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
02/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Yes
02/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
02/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Yes
02/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
02/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
02/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Yes
02/11/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
02/11/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
02/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Yes
02/11/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
02/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Ok  i understand
02/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 220 5689: For now no queries
02/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Takudzwa's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Takudzwa is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
02/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Yes i am.  And also his mother is now in this group maybe she is still at work but  i am sure she will go through  all the chats
02/11/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, also before we end our conversation for today, may I know if you by when will you be able to share Takudzwa's O level result?
02/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Ok its only that i was occupied with the issue i addressed  earlier but very soon maybe Monday or Tuesday
02/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. However, we shall share your application after we have received your O-level, results.
02/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Ok thank you for this nice conversation wishing you also a gud day
05/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 220 5689: <Media omitted>
05/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Takudzwa's O'level results
06/11/23, 11:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded it was past our available hours for Saturday so we were not able to connect with you and on the weekends the team is not available. Thank you for sharing the academic documents, it is duly noted with us. Now we shall be sharing your application with the universities.
06/11/23, 11:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
06/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 220 5689: Ok thanx
17/11/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Takudzwa,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/11/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

17/11/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 6:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takudzwa!
I trust you are doing well.

I am Mr. Milan Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/11/23, 6:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/11/23, 8:23 pm - +27 83 770 8100: On behalf of Takudzwa and the entire family I would like to take this opportunity to thank the University for accepting Takudzwa's application and for offering him a scholarship, you are highly appreciated
18/11/23, 8:33 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Thank you very much for the congratulatory  message
18/11/23, 8:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 8:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 8:43 pm - +27 83 770 8100: I will be available from 8:00 PM if it is convenient for you
18/11/23, 8:43 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Yes , we can proceed
18/11/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 9:03 pm - +27 83 770 8100: 1. 900 USD.   2.4years...8  Semesters.  3.300USD.              4.750 USD .
18/11/23, 9:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 9:54 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Yes
18/11/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Dear Parents and Takudzwa, since my working hours for the day are now over and it is late on my end here, we would be concluding our discussion for now. I appreciate your active participation and cooperation in going through the offer letter details.

Let's reconnect with each other here on Monday at 12.00 PM CAT to continue with our conversation. Until then, have a blessed day ahead, and if you have any immediate concerns, don't hesitate to leave a message here. Thank you and take care.
18/11/23, 10:07 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Thank you and have a nice weekend
20/11/23, 8:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope this message finds you well.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I need to reschedule our ongoing discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University. An urgent matter has arisen that requires my immediate attention.

Due to that, I propose rescheduling our conversation to a new time slot. Could we reconvene today at 01.00 PM CAT in order to move ahead with our conversation? May you, please let me know if this new time suits you, or if you would prefer an alternative time that fits your schedule better.
20/11/23, 10:51 am - +27 83 770 8100: Ok 1:00 PM is fine
20/11/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takudzwa!

I am glad to reconnect with you here. Now, as we're about to reconvene our discussion shortly, I trust you're ready to continue with our conversation as per the schedule? <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 4:15 pm - +27 83 770 8100: I am sorry for the late response, I have just received the message now due to network problem.Yes I am ready
21/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 317 5959: Good morning everyone
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter?
21/11/23, 3:55 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Yes , we can proceed
21/11/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, may I know if you are clear till here, please?
21/11/23, 4:09 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Yes
21/11/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
21/11/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
21/11/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
21/11/23, 4:43 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Understood
21/11/23, 4:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
21/11/23, 4:51 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Yes Sir
21/11/23, 4:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
21/11/23, 4:52 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Yes
21/11/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
21/11/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
21/11/23, 4:57 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Thank you
21/11/23, 4:57 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Yes
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works? <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 5:05 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Yes, explain please
21/11/23, 5:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 5:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 5:21 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Understood
21/11/23, 5:21 pm - +27 83 770 8100: Thank you
22/11/23, 8:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwa!
I trust this message finds you well. I hope you've had a good start to your day.

Regrettably, our conversation was interrupted yesterday before we could conclude our discussion. As we weren't able to finish our conversation, I'm reaching out to ask if we can reconnect here now to continue where we left off and proceed with our discussion regarding the offer letter?
22/11/23, 9:23 am - +27 83 770 8100: Morning how are you
22/11/23, 9:23 am - +27 83 770 8100: Yes we can continue
22/11/23, 9:25 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed?
22/11/23, 9:32 am - +27 83 770 8100: Yes sir
22/11/23, 9:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/11/23, 9:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/11/23, 9:50 am - +27 83 770 8100: No , I am in South Africa and my sister who is in Zimbabwe is in Masvingo
22/11/23, 9:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/11/23, 9:52 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/11/23, 9:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/11/23, 9:59 am - +27 83 770 8100: Thank you
22/11/23, 10:05 am - +27 83 770 8100: Don't you have any associate who is in South Africa as well
22/11/23, 10:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, if you wish to make the payment from South Africa, in that case you can then let us know a day before you are ready to make the payment so that we can get a Mama Money Order generated for you to make the payment. Is that clear?
22/11/23, 10:34 am - +27 83 770 8100: Yes
22/11/23, 10:37 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know, please. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
22/11/23, 10:54 am - +27 83 770 8100: Understood
22/11/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
22/11/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
22/11/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
22/11/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
22/11/23, 11:04 am - +27 83 770 8100: Yes
22/11/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
22/11/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
