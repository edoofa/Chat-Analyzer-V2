I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
23/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Afternoon ma'am, I am ready
23/10/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 166 1168: <Media omitted>

23/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Our last discussion was on step 3
23/10/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
23/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Truly speaking ma'am I have forgotten
23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
23/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Yes maam
23/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
23/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?

25/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Good afternoon maam

What will happen if I don't pay the $300 in the required time
25/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for your query, however, I would like to know why do you think that you will not be able to registration fee?
25/10/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern here, however, please do not worry, ideally if you miss the deadlines the universities revoke their offer letter, however, if discussed with us beforehand and if the Academic Board considers the concern genuine they will help you come up with a payment plan, please.
25/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Okay ma'am, thank you
27/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Good afternoon maam
Can you please add my father since he is now on WhatsApp

27/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 503 3000 was added
27/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that, I have granted you the admin, please go ahead and add your father to the group.
27/10/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Thank you ma'am
05/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Good evening ma'am
I wanted you to know that I got the offer letter from Parul University
06/11/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know. First of all I would like to congratulate you, however, could you please share your offer letter since Parul University is not our partnered university due to many reasons, may I know if you are available to connect with us so that I can help you make aware more about Parul University?
06/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Yes maam, moreso the offer letter has some errors as they have said
06/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 166 1168: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your offer letter from Parul University. Now let me help you explain why we are not partners with Parul University. I understand that since you are not physically present here and since you have limited knowledge about the universities here in India, you do believe in the information that you get on the internet. But, since we have been in the Indian Education sector for more than a decade now, we do have strong connections with the education ministry and organizations all over India due to which we know all about the universities here in India.
06/11/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us first discuss about Parul University. Since you yourself have mentioned its name, I believe you were not aware of the fact that Parul University is not among the institutions listed in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings, and due to the same reason any degree completed by the students at Parul University is not recognized. Were you aware of this?
06/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 166 1168: No l wasn't
06/11/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Now, as I have already mentioned Parul University is unranked in NIRF, and the degree is not recognized. Moreover, the founders of Parul University were accused of rape inside the university and I am sure being an outsider, you might not be familiar with it.

When we know all this about the university and the management working there, there is no way we can ever think of partnering with such universities and sending our students over there.
06/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Okay ma'am
06/11/23, 5:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Being Indians, we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them. With this, you can rest assured that the quality of the university would be up to the mark and would be the right fit for Anesu.

I hope you understand now why Parul University is not one of our partnered universities and I am sure your parents will also not want you to attend a university that has been accused of rape right?
06/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 166 1168: That's true maam
06/11/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so as soon as we receive any update from the universities we shall notify you.
06/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Okay ma'am
14/11/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Anesu,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
14/11/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 6:54 am - +263 78 166 1168: Thank you ma'am, will be available around 12 pm
15/11/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 503 3000: good afternoon maam

we did go through the letter and we want to ask some questions
15/11/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 503 3000: okay
15/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 503 3000: yes ma'am
15/11/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 503 3000: 1) 900Usd
2) 3 years ( 6 semesters)
3) 300 USD
4) 750 Usd
15/11/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 503 3000: yes
15/11/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 503 3000: thank you
15/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 503 3000: for a 3 seater room do we divided the amount or its per individual
15/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 503 3000: yes
15/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263775033000 that will be the individual amount for the whole year, with food included as well, please.
15/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 503 3000: okay maam
15/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 503 3000: we are clear
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 503 3000: thank you maam
15/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 503 3000: okay ma'am we are together
15/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 503 3000: please explain
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 503 3000: yes we are
15/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 503 3000: In Harare
15/11/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Thank you maam
15/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Thank you
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
15/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Okay maam
15/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 166 1168: What if l fail to pay the money before the due date

However, if you keep us informed about your challenges transparently the academic board may consider your reasons and shall provide you an extension if they think that the reason stated is genuine.

15/11/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
16/11/23, 7:12 am - +263 78 166 1168: Good morning maam 
Will l get another offer letter if this one is revoked
16/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
16/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Aftenoon maam

Yes l am
16/11/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, @263781661168 for now your application has been accepted by one university only, we are waiting for updates from other universities, once we get any updates we shall notify you please.
16/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Okay maam
16/11/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Thank you maam
16/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Okay
16/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Understood
16/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Yes maam
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 166 1168: No queries
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

16/11/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
16/11/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
16/11/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on the 18th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
16/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Yes it does
16/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please have a great evening ahead

Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.
18/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 503 3000: okay maam
20/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 166 1168: We discussed about it but there is a problem
20/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Good afternoon maam
20/11/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went and what problems do you want to share regarding the discussion as you mentioned above?
20/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Well the problem is my mom isnt working, my siblings fees are also pendind and its difficult to raise 300 in 2 weeks
20/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand that it must be a challenging situation, in that case, may I know who will be catering for your higher education?
20/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 166 1168: At the moment , l don't know

20/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please that is alright, I can talk to your mother through your phone.
20/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Okay maam
20/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know by when will I be able to connect with her?

21/11/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if your parents are available to connect with us?
21/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Yes she is ready to connct
21/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Connect
21/11/23, 4:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: null
21/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Ms. Vilsha is going to connect with you over the call now.
21/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Okay
21/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 166 1168: My network is down
21/11/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we received an update from Ms. Vilsha that she tried to reach out to you over the call however, it seems like the network is not strong enough to support the same hence I would like to understand from you what time the network would be stable at your end so that we can reschedule our call. Alternatively, if you feel that network challenges can be a hindrance during communication then I can ask Ms. Vilsha to connect with you over the personal window so that she can have a discussion with you and evaluate your application file further and see how best we can help Anesu to pursue her educational goals.
21/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 166 1168: Around 9pm thats when the network will be a bit stable
21/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Due to network issues the call is not possible so may I know if your parents will be available to connect with us tomorrow at 12:30 pm so that we can have a discussion here over texts?
22/11/23, 6:28 am - +263 77 503 3000: Thank you ma'am.We will be able to connect with you over texts at 12:30pm today.
22/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
22/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 503 3000: Good afternoon Ma'am.We are connected with you now
22/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand. However, after working with the Universities for the past couple of years and counseling 1000+ students I understand the reason that these timelines are in place. As you are aware this scholarship opportunity is a worldwide opportunity and not only for your child's rights, and a scholarship comes with a limited number of seats so even if the academic year commences in August- September, the seats would not be available and this is the reasons students are proactive in the admissions at the university.
22/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The idle timeline is 15 days as per the university if someone wants to secure their seat with the university however since you are enrolled through Edoofa and we are aware of the challenges that parents face since these are not new challenges, parents go through them frequently this is the reason why we have meetings with the universities and came up with the Endowment Program which was discussed with you
22/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This approval of the endowment program was possible because of the hard work and the number of arrivals that was possible last year and based on that the university has not only given us the time to pay the registration fees within 45 days but they have also given us an opportunity where we are able to pay $150 out of the $750 registration on your behalf. Now when you see this you already have a 45-day time given by the university with a scholarship if you had to a regular admission you could do that in January or February but at that time you would not be getting the benefits of the endowment so you have to consider that this is an opportunity for you that is benefiting you only if you keep looking at it as a burden then you will not be able to see the bigger picture.
22/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While all of this is true I understand that even after 45 days the financial challenges cannot be resolved considering the economy there. The challenge that you are facing is very common many parents go through the same and I believe this is exactly why you wanted your child to study abroad in the first place so that he does not go through the same challenges that you are going through in the coming 10 years, right?
22/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 503 3000: That is very true ma'am
22/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have been able to understand what I have been trying to say since I understand that the concern is genuine so I will be able to assist you for that I would need to understand how much will you be able to raise by the 27th of November?
22/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 503 3000: We ask for the extension because her Anesu mother is not working at the moment and where I am working they have not been giving us full salaries for several months.They owe us up to seven months full salaries.However I am confident that by paying up fees for this year to clear by month end,I will be able star finance Anesu with little hinderance.
22/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 503 3000: Thank you for your understanding I really appreciate it.I will be able to pay 150 dollars by 28 November.
22/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 503 3000: towards Anesu's registration
22/11/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that completely, since you were able to communicate with me, I will be able to assit you here. Now to ensure alignment with your preferences, I would like to get a confirmation from your end for the same payment plan. If you find this plan acceptable, I can connect with the team first thing tomorrow to explore the feasibility with the academic board. Hence, I would like to know if you are comfortable with the following payment plan, and do you believe it aligns with your financial capabilities?

1. $150 before 28th November 2023
2. $450 before 28th December 2023.
22/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 503 3000: I appreciate the payment plan.However I still think that I may not be able to clear 450 by December, that is why I am asking for your grace period to be extended to end of January though I will try my level best to clear the amount.
22/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me certainly, I will be able to have a conversation with the university officials however, for if you wish to complete the registration process in January you will end up losing the endowment grant, and you will be required to make the payment of the registration fee at once without the $150 on the registration fee of $750, which through the endowment plan you are only to pay $600 and I am sure you do not want that? <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, I understand your concern, in that case, I would like to know if you are comfortable with the following payment plan, and do you believe it aligns with your financial capabilities?

1. $150 before 28th November 2023
2. $150 before 28th December 2023
3. $300 before 28th January 2024
