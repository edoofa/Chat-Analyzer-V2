23/08/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 156 0919 joined using this group's invite link
23/08/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Good evening we are ready now
23/08/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 156 0919: This message was deleted
23/08/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 156 0919: Good evening  im Kudzaishe
We are donr going through the image
23/08/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Kudzaishe, it is a pleasure to connect with you today, please before we proceed, may I know how are you doing today?
23/08/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 156 0919: Im doing so well thank you
23/08/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that and I am looking forward to connecting with you. Now since you mentioned that you were able to go through the image above. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
23/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
23/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
23/08/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 156 0919: Very clear
23/08/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
23/08/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
23/08/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Following
23/08/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 156 0919: We are following
23/08/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 395 7708: Together
23/08/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
23/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
23/08/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 156 0919: Very clear thank you
23/08/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Very clear
23/08/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
23/08/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 395 7708: We can proceed
23/08/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 156 0919: Yes we can proccede
23/08/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 273 4722: You can go ahead
23/08/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/08/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
23/08/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
23/08/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
23/08/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
23/08/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
23/08/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
23/08/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
23/08/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 156 0919: The network this side is bad so its taking too long
23/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, may I know if you will be able to go through the videos by tomorrow 01.00 pm?
23/08/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 156 0919: Yes by 01:00 we would have gone through it but during the day we are not available maybe we will resume in the evening
23/08/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, we shall reconnect at the same time which is 09.00 pm CAT. I hope you will be available tomorrow.
23/08/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 156 0919: Yes we will available 
Thank you
23/08/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 395 7708: Thanks we will
23/08/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night, and convey my regards to your parents as well.
24/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Kudzaishe.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
24/08/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Good evening this is Kudzaishe typing
I'm having problems with my phone so I'm using my mother's
24/08/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Yes we were able to go through the video's
24/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, great so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
24/08/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Video 1 understood that: 
You have to follow instructions and you have to be open minded 
Video 2: it's not about being accepted but you have to work hard, you need a positive attitude, the other reason for this program is to make education easy
Video 3: helps students engage in gaining knowledge, basic skills, express ideas and also a positive mindset
Also while learning you get opportunities to work serving the community
Video 4: The SOP is issued to university to convince them why they should choose you
It's also improve your vision
You should be source full and no delays
24/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
24/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
24/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

UI/UX refers to the screens, buttons, toggles,icons and other visual elements that you interact with when using a website, app, or othera electronic devices. UX refers to the entire interaction you have with a product, including how you feel about the interaction. UX design refers to the term user experience design while UI  stands for user interaction design. The use of UI/UX in today's digital world is it creates an excellent product that is user-friendly, engaging, and meets the needs of its users. Also adopting a clear UI/UX design strategy from the start helps businesses address usability issues long before they negatively impact user experience. Such an approach also helps businesses avoid extra re-design and correction costs in the future. The best UI clearly articulates what is important. The end goal of any UI interactions are always transparent and efficient. UI has become the driving factor behind the success of different software systems.

 *Question 3*
The OSI stands for Open System Interconnection is reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer. OSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a particular network function. The seven layers are Physical , Data link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
1. Physical layer - it is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes. It defines the connector, the electrical cable or wireless technology connecting the devices and is responsible for the transmission of the raw data which is simply a series of 0s and 1s, while taking care of bit rate control.
 
2.  Data link - it establishes and terminates a connection between two physically connected node on a network. It breaks up packets into frame and sends them from source to destination. This layer composes of two parts Logical Link Control which identifies network protocols, performs error checking and synchronizes frames, and  Media Access Control which uses MAC addresses to connect to devices 

3. Network layer it's has two Main functions . One is breaking up segments into network packages, and resembling the packets on the receiving end. The other is routing packets by discovering the best path across a physical network

4. Transport layer - it takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into segments on the transmitting end .

5. Session layer creates communication channels, called sessions between devices. It is responsible for opening sessions , ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being trayand closing them when communication ends

6. Presentation prepares data for the application layer 
It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt and compress data so it is received correctly on the other end.

7. Application layer it is used by end user software such as web browsers and email. It provides protocols that allow software to send and receive information and present meaningful data to users

 *Question 4* 
Programming is the designind, testing and analysing of data 
The most used programming languages among developers worldwide are HTML, Python, SQL and Typescript

 *Question 5* 
Compilers translate code from high level language to machine code before the program runs.  While interpreter translates code written in a higher level programming language into machine code line by line . Compilers is for security purposes and it is more useful while the interpreter is a little vulnerable in case of security. A compiler runs faster while interpretered code runs slow. A compiler displaya all errors after complications.
The compiler is large while interpreter are often smaller than compilers.
Compiler is not flexible while interpreter is flexible.

25/08/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 273 4722: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
25/08/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
25/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of computer applications for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
25/08/23, 10:31 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Yes let's continue
25/08/23, 10:31 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Yes
25/08/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
25/08/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
25/08/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/08/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Yes I'm sure
25/08/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
25/08/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
25/08/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
25/08/23, 10:35 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Yes we  did
25/08/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
25/08/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Yes
25/08/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
25/08/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Clear
25/08/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
25/08/23, 10:40 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Yes we are following
25/08/23, 10:41 pm - +263 77 395 7708: Following
25/08/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
25/08/23, 10:43 pm - +263 77 273 4722: No we don't have..we understood
25/08/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Monday so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.

It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
21/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 745 3496: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 745 3496: Yes thank you
21/10/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 745 3496: For now I don't have. Thank you
21/10/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/10/23, 12:07 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes. We are very excited for this journey that Edoofa is taking us through
21/10/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/10/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/10/23, 12:09 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Iam done going through the benefits.
We can move on
21/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
21/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Kudzaishe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Following
21/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes. I'm following very well
21/10/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/10/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yesss.
We can move on
21/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/10/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
23/10/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Kudzaishe,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
23/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes I'm available
23/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
23/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 745 3496: So far I'm clear we can continue
23/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
23/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 745 3496: No all clear
23/10/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
23/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yesss I'm very excited for the next step and also for the offer letter
23/10/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
23/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Noted....

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Gulzar Group Of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/11/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

18/11/23, 6:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kudzai!
I trust you are doing well.

I am Mr. Milan Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/11/23, 6:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 745 3496: following
18/11/23, 7:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 7:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Thank you Edoofa family for the offer letter
18/11/23, 7:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well. <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 7:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well? <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 745 3496: 1. US$ 1200
2. 4years
3.  The registration fee is $750
18/11/23, 8:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1200.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
18/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 273 4722: We are following.
18/11/23, 8:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
18/11/23, 8:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
18/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Following
18/11/23, 8:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill

These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
18/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes it did
18/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes we following
18/11/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1200 and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2400, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Noted we understand
18/11/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
18/11/23, 9:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Dear Parents and Kudzaishe, since my working hours for the day are now over and it is late on my end here, we would be concluding our discussion for now. I appreciate your active participation and cooperation in going through the offer letter details.

Let's reconnect with each other here on Monday at 12.00 PM CAT to continue with our conversation. Until then, have a blessed day ahead, and if you have any immediate concerns, don't hesitate to leave a message here. Thank you and take care.
19/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 273 4722: Noted with thanks
20/11/23, 7:59 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kudzaishe!
I hope this message finds you well.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I need to reschedule our ongoing discussion regarding the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes. An urgent matter has arisen that requires my immediate attention.

Due to that, I propose rescheduling our conversation to a new time slot. Could we reconvene today at 01.00 PM CAT in order to move ahead with our conversation? May you, please let me know if this new time suits you, or if you would prefer an alternative time that fits your schedule better.
20/11/23, 8:14 am - +263 71 745 3496: Noted .we will be available at that time
20/11/23, 8:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding. I'm glad 1 PM works for you. I look forward to our continued discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University at the scheduled time now.
20/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Good day 
Im ready for the session
20/11/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudzaishe!

I am glad to reconnect with you here. Now, as we're about to reconvene our discussion shortly, I trust you're ready to continue with our conversation as per the schedule?
20/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes we are ready
20/11/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. How was your weekend?
20/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 745 3496: We had a great weekend
Hope you also enjoyed yours
20/11/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yea, please. I had enjoyed my weekend as well. Now, let us move ahead with our discussion here. Before we do that, may I know if you are clear till here please?
20/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes we are clear
21/11/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudzaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter?
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes we can proceed
21/11/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, before we move ahead with our discussion here, may you please let me know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our conversation?
21/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Everything was clear thank you
21/11/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
21/11/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2400. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2400 - $1000 = $1400, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
21/11/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous? <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes it really does
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. Shall we?
21/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes we can go ahead
21/11/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2400 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after [name] arrives in India will be $2400 - $750 = $1650. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $825 and $825, with a six-month gap between them.
21/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 745 3496: OK noted
21/11/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of your arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
21/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes its clear
21/11/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
21/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes we are together.
But wanted to ask , does the whole 750 paid in 15 days altogether
21/11/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, we are coming to that moving ahead. Now, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes please
21/11/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Understood thank you very. much
21/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 273 4722: Understood and very clear
21/11/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Yes we live in harare
21/11/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Ok thank you very much.
Noted
21/11/23, 4:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 4:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Noted very clear 


And please do provide the account details
21/11/23, 5:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 745 3496: Ok noted we will use either options
