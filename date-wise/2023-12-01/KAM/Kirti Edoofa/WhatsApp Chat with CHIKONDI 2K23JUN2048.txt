Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chikondi.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress @263712305036 @263773842547 @263775235706?
19/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 230 5036: The registration process is when the administration shares my application with multiple universities that are applicable to my course and recommended by the Academic board
19/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Once the universities accept my application they will send offer letters and l will choose from those
19/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?

19/10/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand.

19/10/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/10/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Noted
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
19/10/23, 6:37 pm - +263 71 230 5036: I have reviewed them
19/10/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Chikondi, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.

26/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes l am available
26/10/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far
26/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes well understood
26/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes it does
27/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chikondi.

I hope you are doing well. I couldn't help but notice that we have been not able to have a smooth conversation for the past few days, may I know if you are facing some kind of challenges that you would like to share with us?
27/10/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Chikondi,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
28/10/23, 4:28 am - +263 71 230 5036: I am facing network problems sir
28/10/23, 7:34 am - +263 71 230 5036: Morning how are you
28/10/23, 7:34 am - +263 71 230 5036: Yes weare still connected
30/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
30/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/10/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 230 5036: We are clear
30/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 523 5706: Yes I agree
30/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 523 5706: Is this how you refund the enrollment fee
30/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 523 5706: How would you refund registration and enrollment fee if the student finally decides not to come to India for some genuine reasons . May be have obtained another scholarship with more aadvantages than Edoofa. Pliz help
30/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 523 5706: We know you are doing business as well as helping our children to explore but when it comes to financial commitment there is need for transparency
30/10/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query and I will certainly get back to it. However, before we proceed, I'd like to understand whether your query is driven by curiosity or if you are encountering financial challenges that are causing you to reconsider moving forward with this scholarship?
30/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 71 230 5036: I think its driven by curiosity
30/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Currently she went off line her battery is dead
30/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 230 5036: We just need to know how the money is refundable. We expect you to refund the money the way you were paid. I've said there might be genuine reasons to quit, for example in the case of death .
30/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 230 5036: These are just nice to known
30/10/23, 7:14 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Mr Kirt you are communicating with Chikondi's mother on her WhatsApp
30/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 71 230 5036: In Zimbabwe we struggle to source university fees even locally.  We can manage to pay but through a tough hustle.
30/10/23, 7:24 pm - +263 71 230 5036: My question  must stop us from moving forward with our steps. I'm driven by curiosity. We just want to feel secured.
30/10/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Sorry .My question must not stop us....
30/10/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concerns, and I understand where you are coming from and the query you have is quite a genuine one. In such a scenario let's take an example where you do not have the required finances for your child to continue his or her higher education abroad. In such a scenario, I believe you would be preparing Chikondi to pursue her Education locally or would be going through another scholarship, is that right?
30/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 230 5036: No . I've raised this question because your refunding procedure is not satisfying me.Its not necessarily that my child has a potential to quit but remember it's me the parent who is going to be refunded not the children
30/10/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for that, however, could you please elaborate on your concern, so that I can understand your concern better?
31/10/23, 4:12 am - +263 77 523 5706: The question came after explaining benefits number 3 when a child has put a stop to her academic career . May be I didn’t understand the explanation better
31/10/23, 4:24 am - +263 77 523 5706: For progress sake let’s switch on to our next discussion
31/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes we are clear now
31/10/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
31/10/23, 7:02 pm - +263 71 230 5036: No queries
31/10/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
31/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes l am excited
31/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
31/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 523 5706: Thanks. We will be waiting for the next step
31/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Noted

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

16/11/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Chikondi,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes we are still connected l am the only one available and my phone has network challenges
16/11/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I am sure your parents can go through the conversation once they are available. May I know if you are ready to start with the discussion?
16/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes l am
16/11/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 71 230 5036: No.1.            900dollars 
2.                    5 years
3.                    300dollars
4.                    750 dollars
16/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes itdoes
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Noted
16/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes it does
16/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chikondi

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday however, you did not respond although I noticed that you were able to go through my message. May I know if we are still connected?
17/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes we are still connected how are you
17/11/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, i am doing great. Amazing, so may I know if you are clear so far?
17/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes we are clear
17/11/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/11/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes we are
17/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 8:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
18/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 230 5036: Yes l would
18/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 230 5036: Morning hw are you
18/11/23, 8:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
18/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 230 5036: Yes l am
18/11/23, 9:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 9:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 230 5036: Noted
18/11/23, 10:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 10:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 230 5036: I reside in marondera
18/11/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Ok thank you
18/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes you may
20/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chikondi.

I hope you are doing well, I wanted to inform you that we will be connecting today at 06:00 pm CAT, to discuss the offer letter in more detail and address any queries that you might have. I hope you will be available, have a great day till then!
20/11/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response, however you did not response, since our available hours for today are over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
21/11/23, 5:22 am - +263 71 230 5036: Morning how are you
21/11/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chikondi.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes l am available
21/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Thank you
21/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome,  now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
21/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Noted
21/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
21/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
21/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes l hve
21/11/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
21/11/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
21/11/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 230 5036: Yes it does
21/11/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/11/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 230 5036: No queries at all
21/11/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

21/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
21/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on 23rd of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
