03/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 73 290 9611: *1. All three projects*

Corporate Alliances
Community Building 
African Schools Education Reform Mission

 *2. What I understand from project 1*

It's a project by which students are to learn networking skills and also a way of reaching out to people who are influential. It also builds confidence and communication skills within the students.  Also, it teaches students not to give up. I also understood that the student will be earning scholarship credits in the process.

 *3. What I understood from project 2*

It's mainly of reaching out to both personal and extended networks and expose them to the opportunity which will eventually lead them to success through Higher Education. Us as Edoofians will give them a hand in directing them to take the right or the good recipe which will lead them for throughout their entire lives. I also understood that I will be getting at least $20 scholarship credit following the payment of the first part of the enrollment fee by the student. 

 *4. What I understood from project 3*

Project 3 is mainly about seeking for willing local schools within the local area and have a word with the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa. About this project which is project 3, I also understood that I will uplift my mindset in approaching people who are influential, a never giving up attitude which is self motivation and also facing rejections specifically from other school which will make me confident.

Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
08/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 73 290 9611: 1. My school is Terence Cecil Hardy High and it is not yet connected with Edoofa 

2. Dear Sir/Madam
I Takunda Norman Kunungune, a  student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
Students on your school can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I am determined to depend on myself financially, to be a success in life and to create employment. My main goal is to wealth creation and I am heading towards it through Edoofa. Students on your school can also achieve the same through Edoofa. 
All the best thank you.

3. My school is in Mashonaland East Province
08/11/23, 9:18 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 73 290 9611: I totally agree Ms Sharda thank you
08/11/23, 1:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
08/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 73 290 9611: I am ready madam
08/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 73 290 9611: Pardon me for the late reply
08/11/23, 3:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
08/11/23, 3:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
08/11/23, 3:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Takunda*, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
08/11/23, 3:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will definitely help you out.
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All.

08/11/23, 4:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: you are welcome please, Takunda.
08/11/23, 4:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
08/11/23, 4:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

Madam it's so unfortunate that I came to find out that my religion does not give me the privilege to celebrate other essential occasions in other religions, for instance, Dewali in Hinduism as I am a Christian. I am sorry for that madam thank you.
