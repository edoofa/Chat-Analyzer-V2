Kindly excuse me for the delay in reply. There was some technical issue in my devise.
Now that your examinations have started already, and I do not want to prevent you from giving your best there. Hence, I would like to conduct a three-day long fastrack session that can be attended by your parents on your behalf.
And then we can put your program on hold, until your exams get over.

18/10/23, 8:59 am - +263 77 455 9977: Morning, Shumirai has two exams today so she is not available. She has already started writing.
18/10/23, 9:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for informing me about that dear parent. I have full faith that Shumirai will perform really well.
18/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 455 9977: Thank for your encouraging words
18/10/23, 9:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand Shumirai's  situation, and I know Shumairai have the exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to complete your session within 2 days.

This is the Fastrack version of the session which will be completed within 2 days, and this can either be attended by you or your parents on your behalf.

*Do let me know once you are done reading this, so that we can start the FastTrack session.*
19/10/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning, Shumirai! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
19/10/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 647 6095: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 647 6095: Morning Shumirai is writing exam this morning soon after exam she will communicate
19/10/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for informing me about the same.
Sinc she is busy writing the exams, is it possible for you to attend the session on her behalf?
19/10/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 455 9977: Morning, yes we are ready go ahead
19/10/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
19/10/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/10/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 455 9977: Thank you
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Shumirai* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Shumirai* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
19/10/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 10:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following the discussion ?
19/10/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 455 9977: Thank you I read the newsletter and I hope Shumirai will read it. It's so inspiring
19/10/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 455 9977: We have network challenge here causing the delays in delivering messages
19/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 455 9977: Yes I am following the discussion
19/10/23, 10:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: I can completely understand that.
19/10/23, 10:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
19/10/23, 10:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Shumirai*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Shumirai* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
19/10/23, 10:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Shumirai* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
19/10/23, 10:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 455 9977: Thank you I went through the document ma'am
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, thank you foe letting me about that.
19/10/23, 12:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Shumirai* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Shumirai* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
19/10/23, 12:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
19/10/23, 12:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once *Shumirai* is back, she is supposed to note a few things.

 In the sessions (that will be happening on the days chosen), the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter will be discussed.
 All the conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
Edoofa EWYL (contact) -   +91 98107 89170
19/10/23, 12:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say '*Greetings, Ms. Sharda, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'*

20/10/23, 11:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great, thank you for updating me regarding the same.
20/10/23, 11:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want *Shumirai* to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.
20/10/23, 11:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I parent of , *<NAME>*, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME>  would like to inform you that *Student* won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because of exams that start from _ to __ (date) and she/he will reach out to my mentor, *Ms. Sharda* as soon as the exams get over.

These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!
