04/08/23, 8:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wow! Why don't you share some pictures then?
04/08/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 894 1760: I will give you on Monday when l go to school  . I will ask my teacher
04/08/23, 8:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: That would be great!
04/08/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 894 1760: Ok
04/08/23, 8:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
04/08/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 894 1760: What are they
04/08/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
04/08/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
04/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 894 1760: Wow that's nice thank you
04/08/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
04/08/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 894 1760: I have finished reading the email
04/08/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
04/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 894 1760: Ok great to know that
04/08/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

23/08/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 894 1760: The aim is to look for a potential company that can collaborate with Edoofa. The nature of the company should be put into consideration looked at either it's Ed tech platforms or  content centric platforms  .   Also scale of the campany should be looked at . It Should not be too big or too small but range from 50-200 employees.  Financial stability must also be looked at   .  the company should be financial well .

23/08/23, 10:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session here. We shall now connect tomorrow to move forward with our journey!🛩️
23/08/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 894 1760: Ok thank you
24/08/23, 8:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, my proud edoofian!

How are you doing today? Are you ready for your session?🚀
24/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 894 1760: Yes lm ready
24/08/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 894 1760: Sorry for late reply network error in my area
24/08/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
24/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
24/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
24/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
24/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
24/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

24/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 894 1760: Ok thank you
24/08/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
24/08/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

24/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
24/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
24/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
24/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
24/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
24/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
24/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

29/08/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 894 1760: Ok that's fine
29/08/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Emmanuel we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
29/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 894 1760: No questions this is clear
29/08/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
29/08/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
29/08/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
29/08/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 894 1760: Yes
29/08/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
29/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 894 1760: Exciting
29/08/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
29/08/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 894 1760: Ok
29/08/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
29/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 894 1760: Understand

31/10/23, 6:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Emmanuel!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Emmanuel and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 894 1760: Thank you  mentor
07/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 894 1760: I think some of the skills which l have which includes communication skills and being a friendly person is going to make me successful in my EWYL journey
17/11/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263788941760

Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
