06/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes ma’am 
I am ready
06/11/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So Kudakwashe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
06/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Okay 
So it has always been my dream to play a significant part in the community that l grew up in and l can do so only if l get the opportunity to be a Civil Engineer and so my long-term goal is to improve the standards of living of my fellow citizens by playing part in infrastructure development because my country particularly my community that the moment lags far behind when it comes to roads, bridges and administration buildings to mention just but a few.The EWYL program will help me to be able to fulfill my dreams by teaching me the basic skills l need and at the same time earning from learning from you as well
06/11/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's a truly commendable dream, and it's wonderful to hear about your aspirations to make a significant impact on your community. Becoming a Civil Engineer and contributing to infrastructure development is a noble goal, especially in areas where improvements are much needed.
I'm here to support you in your journey, and I'm excited to be a part of your learning process. 🌟👷‍♂️
06/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Sorry for the late reply
My network connection is really poor due to power outages
06/11/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand!
06/11/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Thank you ma’am!
06/11/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: May I also have a response on this.
06/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes ma’am
06/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 359 5826: The two objectives?
06/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 359 5826: The objectives are:
1.To make higher education affordable.
2.To provide theoretical and practical education to its learners
06/11/23, 3:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/11/23, 3:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Thank you ma’am!
I now understand the objectives better
06/11/23, 3:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session.
06/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Thank you ma’am for your time.
Hopefully my network will be better in our next session
07/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Good Afternoon ma’am

20/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Thank you!
20/11/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Yes!
Monday and Thursday will work for me.
20/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Unfortunately l cannot connect with you on Saturday because that's the day l will be at church so will not be active on WhatsApp on this day.
20/11/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263772297277 For now you would have to connect with me every day and the choice will be shared when we have completed the initial orientation.
20/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Understood!
20/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
20/11/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Okay, Thank You!
20/11/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes ma'am l did notice the Edoofa Hall of Inspiration and its such a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself!
20/11/23, 3:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
20/11/23, 3:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!

21/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 359 5826: Sorry ma'am for the late reply
I had to read the document twice so that l don't miss any point.
21/11/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, but you have to put in efforts to make the session productive
21/11/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: So now we will meet at the second half and continue the session till then submit your understanding.
21/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 359 5826: Okay so basically the document is about the projects that have been designed by the EWYL team that l have to be part of inorder to score scholarship credits.

The first part of the document was explaining how business operations are fast changing as most of the operations are being held online in this post COVID-19 era and the skills that one has to attain for him/her to be useful in the future.These skills include social media literacy, digital literacy ,creative content writing, data analysis and remote team work.
21/11/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 359 5826: The first project is Corporate Alliances and it is basically about representing Edoofa to other companies to build a strong professional network with these companies as well as potential employers.

This project improves one's networking skills, good communication skills and digital literacy as one gets to use professional networking websites.It also helps in one's mindset as one might face rejections which will help to build a "never give up" attitude.

The project includes identifying local organizations and companies in mu region and identifying the decision makers of these companies.Afterwards l have to reach out to these companies on behalf of Edoofa and share Edoofa's vision, its mission and the work they do.I also have to arrange for a call meeting between the two parties that is Edoofa and the organization  call and finally facilitate in the signing of contract with these organizations.

This project will result in me getting $32 worth of scholarship credits per organization.
21/11/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 359 5826: The second project is for me to persuade my personal networks that's my friends, relatives and former schoolmates as well as my extended networks to be partake  in this life-changing opportunity to be part of the Edoofa family.This exercise will also improve my networking skills as well as my persuasion skills apart from the minimum $55 worth of scholarship credits for every student who successfully becomes an Edoofia.
21/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 359 5826: The last project is for me to reach out to senior secondary schools in my region and for me to speak to the decision makers of these particular schools to collaborate with Edoofa.
This project is a non commercial tie up but its major  objective is for Edoofa to help schools in  areas such as sharing of world class technology and innovations as well as career counselling.
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Are you ready for the session🚀
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/11/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So may I have a response on this.
21/11/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263713595826 I would appreciate it if you could make an effort to remain engaged during your sessions.
21/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 359 5826: I have learnt that the objective of the first project that is Corporate Alliance is for me familiarize myself with the market in which  l would want to work in ,in the future.I have to identify companies that are technologically driven.After identifying them, l have to market Edoofa to them explaining this organization's objectives as well as how Edoofa has been assisting me and then l have to link the organizations to Edoofa
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
21/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 359 5826: My network is not performing very well and as a result the messages are taking longer than expected to be sent back to you.
21/11/23, 3:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

22/11/23, 7:29 am - +263 77 229 7277: From the Guide for Searching Companies, l have learnt the steps l will use to get to the founders of companies.These companies much be ystudent-centric or content-centic or recreational in nature.They must also be financially stable and the scale of the employees of the companies much range from 50-200.The information pertaining to these companies can be found on social media platforms as well as on google and on LinkedIn.
22/11/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Rise and shine to a brand new day filled with possibilities! 🎉
Hope you are well.

22/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 229 7277: From the  audio you sent, l understood that the corporates l have to look for are those that are related to the job l would want to do when l finish school but from the guide it seems as if the corporates have to either be student-centric, recreational or content-centric of which these natures do not quite align with my desired future job.
22/11/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: This is amazing!
You are absolutely correct.
22/11/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

22/11/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: You can surely do it but then not as a representative of Edoofa, you can do it for your personal reach.
22/11/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 229 7277: Okay, l understand.
22/11/23, 8:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.

22/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 229 7277: okay ma'am!
22/11/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
But let me tell you if you utilize your time focusing on other projects it will be beneficial and when we resume with this project I will let you know.
22/11/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!

22/11/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
22/11/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
22/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 229 7277: Okay, so the second project is  community building which is basically about me sharing this opportunity that l was given to be part of the Edoofa family to other African students who have not received the same opportunity so that they might as well be part of this beautiful family.This can be done using social media platforms and as l result l get scholarship credits for every student who manages to be an Edoofian that l would have reached out to.
22/11/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

23/11/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
23/11/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

23/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
23/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Kudakwashe, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success.
