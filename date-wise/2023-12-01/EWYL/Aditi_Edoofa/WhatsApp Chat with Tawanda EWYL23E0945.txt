how are you
29/11/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.
29/11/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Have you shared this with your parents?

29/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Graduating with a certain grade point average . EWYL program will help me to reduce the cost of  fees
29/11/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, The EWYL program is surely a great opportunity to support you in achieving your desired grade point average and consequently reduce the financial burden of fees. Best of luck on your academic journey, and I hope the program brings you the success you're aiming for!
29/11/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Thank you
29/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 324 6917: No
29/11/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/11/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*

30/11/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
30/11/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?

30/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 324 6917: The EWYL team is made up of highly skilled individuals, each with their own unique talents and expertise.
