May I know if you are available for the session?
25/09/23, 5:43 am - +263 78 128 2110: Good morning ,l am sorry   for being absent.Most of the time l will be occupied  we study learning  from 7am to 5pm
25/09/23, 5:43 am - +263 78 128 2110: If  l find free time l will  inform you
25/09/23, 7:37 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning, Parents and our Edoofian

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this. <This message was edited>
29/09/23, 10:31 am - +91 78273 08969: Dear Brooklyn,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Wednesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

I hope you are doing well.

 My name is Ms. Aditi Kapoor and I will be taking forward your EWYL journey from now onwards.🚀

Unfortunately, Ms. Tenzin won't be able to take your sessions from now onwards as she won't be continuing as your mentor due to her health concerns, but I wanted to make sure that you don't miss out on any learning and earning opportunities. 

I am looking forward to helping you reach great heights in the future. And I can assure you that all your queries will be resolved and I will be working to help you in making this journey fruitful!💯
05/10/23, 4:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To embark on this new beginning🚀, I'm sharing a video to enhance our mutual understanding and set the stage for a successful journey ahead. I would love to hear your thoughts on the video.😊📽️

18/10/23, 1:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @263781282110 @27710055751 
I hope you are well.
 I've sent you a few messages and haven't received any acknowledgment or response from you. I understand that we all have busy schedules, but it's important for us to maintain effective communication.
If there's a specific reason for the delay or if you have any concerns, please let me know. Open and timely communication is crucial for our ongoing collaboration.
I expect your prompt attention to this matter.
18/10/23, 2:16 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Greetings!l am Brooklyn's father.There are two major reasons as to why there has been no communication from him,1.the network at his boarding school is so bad as it is located in a remote area and 2.he is currently busy with his exams.Can l kindly stand in his place for the time being if possible as l believe that sooner he will be available as he will be done with exams.
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - +27 71 005 5751: I thank you very much and appreciate all the efforts.
18/10/23, 4:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for for your kind words!
29/11/23, 1:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Brooklyn @263781282110 @27710055751 

I hope this message finds you well. As *Brooklyn's exams are presumably completed*, I would like to discuss when he plans to return and *resume our EWYL sessions.* His progress is important, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.

Please let me know his availability.
30/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 128 2110: Greetings its Brooklyn.Yes l finished my exams and now available.We can start our sessions from Monday next week

Hope you are well.

Great, I hope your exams went well. <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 128 2110: I am well thanks for asking.

Yes the exams went well
30/11/23, 10:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's great!
30/11/23, 10:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session Monday (4-December-2023) onwards from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM and your sessions will be held from Monday to Friday. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
