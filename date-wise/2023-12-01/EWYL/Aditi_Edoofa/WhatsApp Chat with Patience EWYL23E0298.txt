16/09/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Patience!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
29/11/23, 11:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @263772265234 

I hope this message finds you well. As *your exams are presumably completed,* I would like to discuss when you plan to return and *resume our EWYL sessions.* Your progress is important, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.

Please let me know your availability.

30/11/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session tomorrow onwards from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
