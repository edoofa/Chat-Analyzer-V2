23/09/23, 9:03 am - +91 78273 08969: Good afternoon, Parents and our Edoofian

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
24/09/23, 5:44 am - +263 77 387 8649: We are doing very well and you are also very well.Thank you very much for your patience .Admire is at school right now and he will be available end November at their school they are not allowed to bring phones so he cannot be participating in the sessions ,we are prepared to participate in the sessions on his behalf as his parents but our challenge these days is network due to power cuts . When network is available we will take part in the sessions

27/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Afternoon I am good . How you also today?
27/09/23, 1:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am well, Thank you.

27/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Today I am on line
27/09/23, 1:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey and I can assure you that Admire will learn a lot from this journey to success.
I can see that  Admire is very lucky to have such supportive parents like you.
27/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Thank you for the support also we hope he will learn to be a responsible person
27/09/23, 2:01 pm - +91 78273 08969: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 826 7145: I think it's to enable students to have equal opportunities through out the world .2 to help students to be self reliant
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Admire* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
27/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Thank you
27/09/23, 2:10 pm - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 826 7145: I glad to meet them
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once she form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, she would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

28/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 826 7145: I have gone through the document it's quite motivating ,I will definitely keep it so that Admire will read it
28/09/23, 1:41 pm - +91 78273 08969: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Admire* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Admire* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
28/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 826 7145: I think he is good ,he get in touch with you
28/09/23, 1:46 pm - +91 78273 08969: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

28/09/23, 1:59 pm - +91 78273 08969: following are requirements to be followed.
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share the lesson and activity response before session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
28/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Noted thank you
28/09/23, 2:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Admire has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.

The *counselor* is the first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where he/she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, HE was contacted by the Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, he will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help Admire to fund your higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build Admire's personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
28/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 826 7145: That true he has gone through those stages ,but l have lost the contacts of his mentor Mr Austin may you help me with his contact
28/09/23, 2:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Admire’s involvement in the EWYL program can bring him closer to reaching his career goals.

*I would like you to share when Admire will be joining*. I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with him and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.

Thank you so much for taking out time to complete these discussions, I really appreciate it.
28/09/23, 2:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am sure you are in the counselor group.
28/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 826 7145: I was in the group but my at one point I barred from using whatsapp and I was out all groups
28/09/23, 2:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: I will try to add you back in there.
28/09/23, 2:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: Please answer this.
28/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Admire will finish his exams end of November ,I not sure of the exact date but will visit him mid October
28/09/23, 2:21 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Thank you so much for sharing.
Have a nice day.
28/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Same to you  thank you
29/09/23, 11:59 am - +91 78273 08969: Dear Admire,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

29/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 944 3351: The EWYL stands for
Earn, While, You, Learn. 
This is a voluntarily program offered to the Edoofians, where an Edoofian will work so that his or her earning will cover up the school fees. The EWYL needs more focus, discipline so as to attain my career goals.
29/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 944 3351: *I also learnt that:* 
1. 
 I should do active participation in most of the sessions and I must be punctual and actively engaging in the EWYL discussions. 
2.
Also for every day, before mid day I should start a conversation with a phrase, "I am a proud Edoofian."
30/11/23, 1:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Admire!
Hope you are well.

This is amazing!
30/11/23, 1:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session tomorrow onwards from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
30/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 826 7145: Noted ,hope network won't be a problem . good afternoon
