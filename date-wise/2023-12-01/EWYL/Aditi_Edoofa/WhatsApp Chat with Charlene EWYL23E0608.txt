14/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 479 5588 joined using this group's invite link
14/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 479 5588: Hy how are you.My long term goal is working at a reputed hospital and expand my experience by finding out new methods and engage in more examination and technique

14/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 479 5588: Thank you🙂
14/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
14/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 479 5588: Yes maam
14/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Then can you please brief me about them.
14/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 479 5588: Ok the objectives of the EWYL program are to make higher education affordable and also increases employability.It reduces educational costs through hard work.
14/09/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 479 5588: OK l understand .Thank you for elaborating on that
14/09/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome.
14/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
14/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
14/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 479 5588: Ok .Its such a pleasure to know them and their special duties.
14/09/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, they are also honored.
14/09/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
14/09/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 479 5588: Wow,amazing
14/09/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, it is!
14/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 479 5588: It is indeed a wonderful gratitude letter.lm done with it.
14/09/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that.
14/09/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
14/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 479 5588: Yaah, very interesting
14/09/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

Hope you are well.
22/09/23, 7:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
23/09/23, 11:40 pm - +263 78 517 8501: Greetings maam, lm sorry for no being available for the session.The reason being a sudden change in my school time table.Every single day is now a learning day including the weekend in conjunction with my final examinations which are around the corner.School starts from 6:30am till 9:30 pm, so this is affecting my attendance greatly.
