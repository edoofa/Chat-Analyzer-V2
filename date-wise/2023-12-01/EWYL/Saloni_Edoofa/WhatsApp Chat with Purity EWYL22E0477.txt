I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM* every week⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Greetings.We are all well.

04/10/23, 9:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
04/10/23, 9:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Purity will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
04/10/23, 9:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 239 3437: Done reading
04/10/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Purity can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
04/10/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 239 3437: Yes.Noted
04/10/23, 11:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
04/10/23, 11:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
04/10/23, 11:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
04/10/23, 11:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
04/10/23, 11:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
04/10/23, 11:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
04/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 239 3437: Ok it's noted,but before I do that I need some clarifications.
04/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 239 3437: This is Purity,s mother answering on her behalf and sometimes it's her Father.
So in some cases we  might not be available as per the mentors' request as we both are at work most of the time.
Purity is at a boarding school where she is not allowed to use cellphone,and is about to write her final ALevels.
She will only be available after she finishes her exams that is end of November
04/10/23, 11:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am complete with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Purity takes over her journey on the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Purity is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
and
04/10/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 239 3437: Ok.its noted then.
I will do what you requested.
04/10/23, 11:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once done, let me know.
04/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 239 3437: Ok
