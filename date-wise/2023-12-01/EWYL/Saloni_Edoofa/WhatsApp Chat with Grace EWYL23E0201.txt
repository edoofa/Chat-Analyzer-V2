19/08/23, 1:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Grace, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call.

Once both things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
19/08/23, 1:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/08/23, 1:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: A handwritten letter can be something like this (this is just a sample for you, don't copy-paste anything)
The letter has to be completely based on your personal experience

28/08/23, 1:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So @263781296549 , did you go through the grant certficate?

How are you?
31/08/23, 10:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I please know if you have any doubts about the grant certificate?
31/08/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 336 1426: She had requested  you to reschedule the call since she had a lecture at the time you proposed. Unfortunately you have not responded to the request
31/08/23, 10:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I clearly understand that but before scheduling a session I would want that she drops her concern or atleast respond to my messages.
31/08/23, 10:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: I believe the classes get over around 5 PM and this is a special chance that she has got over so many other students. So she must have read the document by now. <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 336 1426: Ok thank you
31/08/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 129 6549: I've gone through the document

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

15/11/23, 4:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
