It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

17/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 312 3999: Thank you for the newsletter. It's really educative. I have learnt that for one to be successful in life you should put effort in everything you want to achieve. Even when things seem impossible or setbacks keep you back, keep on focusing. Always look at setbacks and failures as learning opportunities. I'm really inspired by the science students who managed to stand for their school in a Business Studies quiz and came in the second place.
