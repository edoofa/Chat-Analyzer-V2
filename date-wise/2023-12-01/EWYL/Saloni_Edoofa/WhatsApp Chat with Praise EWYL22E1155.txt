25/09/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great Praise, let me share further details with you.
25/09/23, 8:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - “I am a proud Edoofian”
25/09/23, 8:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter

3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
25/09/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your session is on *TUESDAY* and *FRIDAY* from *09:30-11:00 AM.*

*MISSED SESSION*- In case you miss your session on TUESDAY, you can have your session on Wednesday. In case you miss it on FRIDAY, you can have your session on Saturday.
25/09/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Are you ready, Praise?

26/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 930 8921: okay
26/09/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
26/09/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you.

14/11/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1) *Daily Morning Ritual:* Each day, we'll kick things off by saying, "I am a proud Edoofian" on the EWYL Line. 🌄 Let's remember that being an Edoofian means being a strong advocate for positive change, focused on self-improvement, and dedicated to making our families proud. The sky's the limit for us as true Edoofians! 🚀

14/11/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since Monday has already passed, we will have a makeup session tomorrow from 09:30-11:00 AM on the EWYL Line.

15/11/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 930 8921: okay lets continue
18/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is the Saturday activity for this week, though I was supposed to share the same with you on the EWYL Line only. I noticed that you did not follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' there, therefore, I took the initiative to share it here since I believe you are a bright student and have the capabilities. But I would like to inform you that I can not always turn my way, I hope you understand that. 
Please make sure you follow the ritual without fail and be present for your session on Monday from 12:00-01:30 PM.

Exciting news! Your sessions are scheduled for Mondays and Thursdays, running from 12:00 to 1:30 PM on the EWYL Line. As we gear up for the week, I'd like to remind you of a few things to keep the energy high and our connection strong:

1. Daily Ritual: Kickstart your day by proudly declaring 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line. It's not just a phrase; it's our way of staying connected and motivated.
2. Agenda for Our Session: In our upcoming session, we're diving into some engaging topics:
a. Saturday Activity: Share your experiences and insights.
b. Project Updates: Let's keep each other in the loop on our progress.
c. Newsletter Discussion: Your input is key to making it great!

I'm looking forward to catching up with you today! If you have any thoughts or questions beforehand, feel free to share. Let's make our sessions not just informative but interactive and enjoyable.
