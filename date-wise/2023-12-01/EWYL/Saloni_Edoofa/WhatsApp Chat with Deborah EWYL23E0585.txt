I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸
07/09/23, 12:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note that our session will be held tomorrow at our respective times.

08/09/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Noted, thank you!
08/09/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
08/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Yes am also excited to work with you and l promise working with me would be a rewarding experience for you and me as well
08/09/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear that! <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
08/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Ok about the people in here they are my relatives  my parents and uncles
08/09/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome them to the group, I am sure they will witness tremendous growth and splendid transition in you as we move ahead in this journey🚀
08/09/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Deborah, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
08/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Yes
08/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 320 5787: I wish to have a good job in the field of law and archive my goals of helping people get justice
08/09/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have planned everything so well!
08/09/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
08/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Yes that would be great. I don't know about the objectives
08/09/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
08/09/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
08/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Ok that is great l understand
08/09/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then, have a great weekend🌺
08/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Ok same to you thank you for the day
11/09/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How did your weekend go?
This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening from *01:30-02:30 PM* this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday.
Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
11/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Greetings sorry for late respond, Deborah is at school
11/09/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know when can she be available?

12/09/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
12/09/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
12/09/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Ok let her reply you soon

16/09/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 320 5787: Good morning thank you very much for giving me your time the time for the session is good  l will be available
16/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 281 3872: Noted. Thank you.
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you see the video, do let me know how you find it and of course, pick out your best section from the newsletter. Excited to hear that out!

And from the news letter l like section number 2 which talks about the starting point which needs to be changed for Bette performance and also that one does not need to start from the bottom but rather you need to learn from those who came before you

07/10/23, 8:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Deborah will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same. <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 8:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 8:13 am - +263 77 320 5787: Ok good morning
07/10/23, 8:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Deborah can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 8:18 am - +263 77 320 5787: Yes we are together
07/10/23, 8:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
07/10/23, 8:20 am - +263 77 320 5787: Yes we can go ahead
07/10/23, 8:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
07/10/23, 8:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
07/10/23, 8:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
07/10/23, 8:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
07/10/23, 8:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
07/10/23, 8:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
07/10/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 320 5787: Ok
07/10/23, 8:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do this, do let me know.

14/10/23, 8:43 am - +263 77 320 5787: Good morning
16/10/23, 7:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Deborah and parents!
How are you?
16/10/23, 7:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since you have completed the introductory formalities, I have kept your session on hold now.

16/10/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 653 5194: OK thank you l have been busy preparing for the exam
16/10/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright!
16/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 653 5194: OK thank you
16/10/23, 1:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 1:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

17/10/23, 8:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day to our proud edoofian and parents!

I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read the above-shared newsletter.
Even parents can do it on behalf of the student.
17/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 320 5787: Greetings how are you
17/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Greetings sorry for the delay l was in an exam
17/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Firstly l  agree  with Henry Ford's belief of providing value before seeking value is a wise approach which is that one should get money as a result of word and not before work.

I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Tuesday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for tomorrow's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the EWYL Group starting tomorrow. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it removes the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting tomorrow, our sessions will be held from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, Monday to Friday, on the EWYL Group. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!

27/11/23, 10:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me tell you that as well soon!
27/11/23, 10:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
27/11/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 653 5194: Ok ok thank  you
27/11/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 653 5194: I understand
27/11/23, 10:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/11/23, 10:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Deborah/Saloni/27NOV2023*
27/11/23, 11:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/11/23, 11:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added) <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 11:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/11/23, 11:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
27/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 653 5194: Ok
27/11/23, 11:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session for today and yes, we will meet tomorrow from 10:00 - 11:00 AM will the same excitement ⚡
27/11/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 653 5194: Thank you for the day and l understand
28/11/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 320 5787: Good morning
28/11/23, 10:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Deborah!
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
28/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 320 5787: Yes we can
28/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 320 5787: How are you today
28/11/23, 10:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: Did you form the group?
28/11/23, 10:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thanks for asking.
28/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 320 5787: Not yet am working on it
28/11/23, 10:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, do add me once done.
28/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 320 5787: Ok ma'am l get it
28/11/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
28/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
28/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

28/11/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 320 5787: I have to spread the information on how Edoofa had helped me so far and also how good is. I have to reach out secondary schools in my area and arrange for a meeting between the headmaster and the directors of Edoofa
