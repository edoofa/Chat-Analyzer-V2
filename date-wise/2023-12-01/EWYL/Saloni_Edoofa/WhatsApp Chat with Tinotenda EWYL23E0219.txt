On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.

07/09/23, 12:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello there!
I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

08/09/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
08/09/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
08/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 559 2975: Okay noted maam
16/09/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM* every week⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 382 1847: Good morning  noted
16/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 382 1847: We will do the session  with u mam as parents  Tinotenda  will b bsy preparing  for her final  examinations thank u
16/09/23, 10:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I acknowledge that you as parents can attend the session.
16/09/23, 10:37 am - +27 61 945 8119: Greetings we are going to attend
16/09/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 382 1847: Ok ma'am
19/09/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you're having a good day.

I will be conducting the session *today, 20 September 2023* from *02:30 to 03:30 PM*⏳ as planned. _It's essential that either the child or a parent is present during the session._

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session later today.
20/09/23, 12:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: @27619458119
20/09/23, 1:45 pm - +27 61 945 8119: It's ok ma'am
20/09/23, 2:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's begin with our session @27619458119
20/09/23, 2:36 pm - +27 61 945 8119: Ooky
20/09/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Tinotenda can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 2:40 pm - +27 61 945 8119: Yes I understand
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.

When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
20/09/23, 2:50 pm - +27 61 945 8119: I as a parent I will continue to attend becoz the child is at school only weekends she will be available
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay that will be great!
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now we are ready to begin a new journey!
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!
