Well they say the way to the heart is through the stomach! 
Food has the power to bring people together, to create memories, and to forge lasting bonds. It can be a way to show love and appreciation, and it can bring comfort and joy. It is often a central part of special occasions and family gatherings.
I therefore suggest apart from the perfect orientation above, I am more than eager to get to know the food culture and tastes of your home country!
I'm looking forward to that too!😂
08/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 305 5181: But most importantly, I'm really looking forward to the messages from my  mentor and the orientors in person to guide us through our academic journey
