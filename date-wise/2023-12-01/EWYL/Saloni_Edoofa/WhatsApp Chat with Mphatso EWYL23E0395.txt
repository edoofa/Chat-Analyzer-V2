01/08/23, 2:38 pm - +260 97 9935858: Good afternoon, sorry I couldn't join earlier.

02/08/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
02/08/23, 1:46 pm - +260 97 9935858: That's great to hear.
02/08/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Mphatso, I kindly ask you to invite your parents to join the group so that they can _actively participate in your progress and share in the achievements you will make._ I am providing you with the link once again so that you can extend the invitation to them. Once your parents have joined the group, we can embark on this thrilling journey together!

02/08/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know when will Mphatso be available and what are the timings fo the school?
02/08/23, 2:02 pm - +260 97 9935858: He is in Boarding School and he will only be home in November after sitting for his examinations.
02/08/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want Mphatso to have full focus on our sessions with me without compromising his time in school, it would be best if we could put our sessions on hold and resume them later when his school is over
 I am doing this solely because you mentioned the paucity of time he is facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
02/08/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail on behalf of NAME to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and Ms. Davi, Head Coach EWYL stating that:

Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because  __  from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my school.

Once done, please let me know.
02/08/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 9935858: I had actually mentioned in the previous sessions before coming here but I was still advised to proceed despite his non availability.

I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 5:28 pm - +260 97 9935858: Greetings to you too! Thank you for reaching out.
15/09/23, 5:29 pm - +260 97 9935858: Unfortunately I can only manage after 5pm or working hours. Could you reschedule?
19/09/23, 12:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

30/09/23, 8:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Mphatso will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
30/09/23, 8:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/09/23, 9:23 am - +260 97 9935858: Read through
30/09/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay, got occupied in an urgent call.
30/09/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: I would request that I take 15 minutes of you of possible and take forward the session.
30/09/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Mphatso can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
30/09/23, 10:28 am - +260 97 9935858: Sure

07/10/23, 8:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
07/10/23, 8:44 am - +260 97 9935858: Student will only be available after 21st November.
07/10/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Mphatso takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Mphatso is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
07/10/23, 8:47 am - +260 97 9935858: So what do you suggest?
07/10/23, 8:50 am - +260 97 9935858: <Media omitted>

07/10/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.

07/10/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
07/10/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
07/10/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
07/10/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
16/10/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read the above-shared newsletter.
Even parents can do it on behalf of the student.
26/10/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning *our proud edoofian and parents*🌟
How are you doing?

This week in India we celebrated _Dussehra, also known as Vijayadashami_, which is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It signifies the *victory of good over evil* and marks the end of the nine-day Navaratri festival. Dussehra honors the legend of *Lord Rama's triumph over the demon king Ravana*👺, symbolizing the victory of righteousness and truth. It is celebrated with grand processions, cultural events, and the burning of effigies of Ravana, signifying the defeat of negativity. Dussehra also emphasizes the importance of moral values and the need to stand up against injustice, making it a significant cultural celebration in India.🇮🇳
26/10/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Dussehra, although not originally linked to Zambia, has found relevance in the country through the Indian diaspora. Zambia is a country with a rich tapestry of cultures and traditions, which is reflected in the variety of festivals celebrated throughout the year. Among the most prominent is *Independence Day,* commemorating Zambia's independence from British colonial rule on October 24th. *Labour Day* on May 1st is also celebrated with parades and events to honor the country's workers. Additionally, Agricultural Shows are held across the country, showcasing Zambia's agricultural heritage. Various ethnic groups in Zambia, such as the Bemba, Tonga, and Ngoni, celebrate their own cultural festivals, including ceremonies and rituals that highlight their unique heritage.

28/11/23, 11:02 am - +260 97 4172165: At the same time I would be spreading edoofa's message through sharing their vision with various people
28/11/23, 11:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: Our session for today is coming to a close, but I'm already looking forward to catching up with you tomorrow from 10:00 - 11:00 AM in the EWYL Group! 🏆 Get ready for another productive and energizing session. Can't wait to see you there!

29/11/23, 10:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is great, you have explained it really well with so much clarity and great vision🫶🏻
29/11/23, 10:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
29/11/23, 10:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 10:16 am - +260 97 4172165: I'm done
29/11/23, 10:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from this process?
29/11/23, 10:28 am - +260 97 4172165: Okay so I will have to identify companies that have turned to networking as they're way of working and share my objectives with them and how edoofa is helping me accomplish this
29/11/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Mphatso. I’m happy with your understanding.
29/11/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
29/11/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 10:35 am - +260 97 4172165: Alright
29/11/23, 10:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
29/11/23, 10:49 am - +260 97 4172165: Please do!
29/11/23, 10:49 am - +260 97 4172165: I understand
29/11/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from the document?
29/11/23, 10:59 am - +260 97 4172165: So basically LinkedIn will helps interact with these start up tech/networking companies that would be willing to help in Edoofa's vision and knowing the background of these companies reaffirms their credibility and reliability so it is important to know they're background first before interacting with them.
29/11/23, 11:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Mphatso, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

How are you?

May we begin with our session?
30/11/23, 10:24 am - +260 97 4172165: Sure
30/11/23, 10:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why are you late for the session?
30/11/23, 10:30 am - +260 97 4172165: My apologies
30/11/23, 10:31 am - +260 97 4172165: My phone was off and I had to charge it
30/11/23, 10:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, I understand that!
30/11/23, 10:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
30/11/23, 10:33 am - +260 97 4172165: Thank you
30/11/23, 10:34 am - +260 97 4172165: Okay does that mean I'll have to start now??
30/11/23, 10:40 am - +260 97 4172165: Hello??
30/11/23, 10:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay,, I got occupied in an urgent call.
30/11/23, 10:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Mphatso, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Mphatso!
30/11/23, 10:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 11:05 am - +260 97 4172165: So basically community building improves my interaction skills with people and persuasion skills aswell and will help me find other students like my self who are willing to enroll into the program and encourage them to do so this growing the edoofian community
30/11/23, 11:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Our session for today is coming to a close, but I'm already looking forward to catching up with you tomorrow from 10:00 - 11:00 AM in the EWYL Group! 🏆 Get ready for another productive and energizing session. Can't wait to see you there!
30/11/23, 11:11 am - +260 97 4172165: Thank you and I'll try to be a tad more punctual tomorrow
30/11/23, 11:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad to hear that!
