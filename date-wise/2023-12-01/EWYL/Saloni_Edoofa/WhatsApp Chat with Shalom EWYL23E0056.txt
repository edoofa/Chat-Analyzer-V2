How are you?

I was at the airport today receiving so many students from different countries, *Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and South Africa*, but yes, in their air, there was just one color, *the color of India*. This was an excellent feeling for me and I can't believe and wait for you to be here🇮🇳
Since I am currently traveling back therefore I won't be able to take the session today but I will schedule it and inform you.

- Please follow the daily ritual on the EWYL Line of saying ' *I am a proud edoofian*'

I won't be available today since I will be occupied in some family event but please make sure you update everything to me as required.
17/08/23, 12:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greeting Shalom
How are you?

It has been 3 days since you followed the daily ritual. May I know if you are facing any challenges?

Not attending the sessions will affect your overall growth and development and I am really worried about the same.

I spend the day doing lessons and ut requires me to travel back and forth.The final exams are around the corner and there's so much that needs to be done. I'm sorry gor lagging behind.
17/08/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 910 3204: *for
17/08/23, 1:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
17/08/23, 1:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
17/08/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 910 3204: Okay thank you
16/10/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to go through the newsletter?
16/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 910 3204: Thank you very much for the newsletter. In the newsletter Mr Angad referred to a book about the life and career of Henry Ford. Henry believed in giving value before acquiring value which is a very wise approach. People acknowledge the service given and if it's good you'll get handsome rewards from your customers if you're running a business. So this is a very good lesson . The hall of inspiration was indeed inspiring, learning to take risks and excelling at the same time is really lovely.
17/10/23, 8:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!
I trust you're doing splendidly.

I wholeheartedly thank you for investing your valuable time in perusing our newsletter. Just as you've shown your support, we are committed to continuously delivering extraordinary newsletters from our side. Your engagement and enthusiasm are truly inspiring!
