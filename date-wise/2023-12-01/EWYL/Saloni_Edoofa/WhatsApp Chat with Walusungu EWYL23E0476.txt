16/08/23, 2:57 pm - +260 96 2476932: Sure no problem.
17/08/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

17/08/23, 1:36 pm - +260 96 2476932: Greetings! 
I'm fine thanks. 
How are you? 

Yes we may begin our session.
17/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
17/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
17/08/23, 1:47 pm - +260 96 2476932: Thank you very much
17/08/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
17/08/23, 2:04 pm - +260 96 2476932: I'm only aware of my mother. The rest are from the Edoofa program.
17/08/23, 2:19 pm - +260 96 2476932: Indeed
17/08/23, 2:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
17/08/23, 3:13 pm - +260 96 2476932: To be successful in all areas physically,  spiritually, intellectually, emotionally as well as in pursuing my career. Yes one may ask "why can't you do that now?" I am doing it however, growth is a process and learning never stops. I want to be a successful cognitive psychologist and help patients suffering from mental illnesses because it is overlooked. I also look forward to building facilities (orphanages, old aged homes and the like) which can help less privileged people in different ways.
17/08/23, 3:18 pm - +260 96 2476932: I'm happy as well. I hope we make more progress tomorrow. Thank you for your time.
17/08/23, 5:20 pm - +260 96 2476932: I believe the EWYL program will help me become independent sooner rather than later because if I'll be able to earn enough I can lessen the burden on my parents of paying my fees. I will also gain experience from it (life skills).
18/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
18/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 2:21 pm - +260 96 2476932: I have finished reading it.
18/08/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what all you grasped from it?
18/08/23, 2:30 pm - +260 96 2476932: I have grasped that this program provides students with an opportunity to acquire skills and earn and redeem credits for necessary payment.
18/08/23, 2:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

21/08/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

22/08/23, 9:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Walusungu!

I'm fine thank you. 
How are you?
22/08/23, 9:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.

22/08/23, 1:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session📖
22/08/23, 1:48 pm - +260 96 2476932: Yes we may,  I'm sorry I'm late.
22/08/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear that, thank you Walusungu⚡
 I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
22/08/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
22/08/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 2:04 pm - +260 96 2476932: Anytime Ms. Saloni.
22/08/23, 2:05 pm - +260 96 2476932: I have read the news letter.
22/08/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
22/08/23, 2:09 pm - +260 96 2476932: I liked the 3 Quotes for you and 2 Questions for you sections.
22/08/23, 2:10 pm - +260 96 2476932: They allow one to reflect on life and continue to forge ahead whilst making better decisions.
22/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes indeed, I also like the quote portion. They are so refreshing and help n bring fresh thoughts through those questions as well.
22/08/23, 2:12 pm - +260 96 2476932: Exactly
22/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
22/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: How does that sound, Walusungu?
22/08/23, 2:13 pm - +260 96 2476932: Amazing!
22/08/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
22/08/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
22/08/23, 2:28 pm - +260 96 2476932: Yes I am.
22/08/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.

25/08/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing Walusungu and it reflects a lot of clarity of thoughts!
25/08/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
25/08/23, 2:09 pm - +260 96 2476932: Yes I am. Thank you for asking.
25/08/23, 2:10 pm - +260 96 2476932: Yes it is clear
25/08/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/08/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It was good, thank you.
28/08/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session🌟

28/08/23, 1:47 pm - +260 96 2476932: I went through the document
28/08/23, 1:48 pm - +260 96 2476932: But I was a little confused. So I would appreciate it if you helped by elaborating it where I don't understand.
28/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sorry for the delay, my device got shut down suddenly. <This message was edited>
28/08/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before going through your concerns, can you share your overall understanding of the document?
28/08/23, 1:59 pm - +260 96 2476932: Don't worry about it.
28/08/23, 2:04 pm - +260 96 2476932: My overall understanding of the document is that it outlines the necessary skills needed to perform jobs in future. It also outlines the projects given to the student in the EWYL program necessary for earning credits.
28/08/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have summed up the understanding really well. Can you share the names of the projects that you read in the document along with one-liner understanding of each?
28/08/23, 2:25 pm - +260 96 2476932: The first project is Corporate Alliances 
In my own understanding this is helping Edoofa get in touch with other Good Companies.
The second project is Community Building which I believe is helping other people seeking better higher education get in touch with Edoofa. 
The third project is African Schools
Education Reform Mission which helps local secondary schools  in my community get in touch with Edoofa for better higher education.
29/08/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session📖

29/08/23, 1:54 pm - +260 96 2476932: Okay thank you.
29/08/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
29/08/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com

I'm unavailable from today till we can communicate again.
01/09/23, 11:03 am - +260 96 2476932: By the way we are not allowed to carry phones to school that's why I won't be available.
12/09/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Walusungu!
How are you?
12/09/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I can understand that,  please study with all your attention and all the very best 🤗
12/09/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, I understand that
16/09/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_.

20/09/23, 2:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's begin with our session @260966952326
20/09/23, 2:38 pm - +260 96 6952326: Yes please
20/09/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Walusungu can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - +260 96 6952326: Well noted thank you
20/09/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
20/09/23, 2:52 pm - +260 96 6952326: I thought l raised that concern in the previous discussion. 
The student is not available for now.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, then you can just complete these formalities.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
20/09/23, 2:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
20/09/23, 3:04 pm - +260 96 6952326: Pardon me,Ms Saloni

20/09/23, 3:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do this, I will put the program on hold don't worry.
20/09/23, 3:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As I said these are some basic formalities.
20/09/23, 3:12 pm - +260 96 6952326: Tuesday and Friday

How are you doing?

This week in India we celebrated _Dussehra, also known as Vijayadashami_, which is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It signifies the *victory of good over evil* and marks the end of the nine-day Navaratri festival. Dussehra honors the legend of *Lord Rama's triumph over the demon king Ravana*👺, symbolizing the victory of righteousness and truth. It is celebrated with grand processions, cultural events, and the burning of effigies of Ravana, signifying the defeat of negativity. Dussehra also emphasizes the importance of moral values and the need to stand up against injustice, making it a significant cultural celebration in India.🇮🇳
26/10/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Dussehra, although not originally linked to Zambia, has found relevance in the country through the Indian diaspora. Zambia is a country with a rich tapestry of cultures and traditions, which is reflected in the variety of festivals celebrated throughout the year. Among the most prominent is *Independence Day,* commemorating Zambia's independence from British colonial rule on October 24th. *Labour Day* on May 1st is also celebrated with parades and events to honor the country's workers. Additionally, Agricultural Shows are held across the country, showcasing Zambia's agricultural heritage. Various ethnic groups in Zambia, such as the Bemba, Tonga, and Ngoni, celebrate their own cultural festivals, including ceremonies and rituals that highlight their unique heritage.
