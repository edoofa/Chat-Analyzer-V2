I hope you're all doing fantastic! I am absolutely thrilled to share the incredible experience of our recent orientation journey at various partner universities. Our orientation event is not just a mere program; it's a grand welcome to an exciting academic adventure. At Edoofa, we ensure that our students are well-prepared for what lies ahead, and we open the doors to a world of exclusive opportunities for them. The response from our amazing students has been nothing short of overwhelming, and I am bursting with pride to be their mentor👏🏼

15/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 71 582 0116: 11 December is it okay with you?
16/11/23, 8:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning parents and Pride,

Yes, the date is fine with me but I believe most of the students are finishing their exam a bit early. So is there any reason you prefer 20th December?
16/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 582 0116: A level exams are ending on the 28th of November. And I these few weeks are for cooling down and settling down
17/11/23, 12:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Pride!
How are you?
17/11/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, we can begin from the 20th but since most of the students are giving an early kickstart so I don't want you to stay behind.
17/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 582 0116: I'm fine ma'am, thank you, how are you too?
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 582 0116: Okay ma'am
