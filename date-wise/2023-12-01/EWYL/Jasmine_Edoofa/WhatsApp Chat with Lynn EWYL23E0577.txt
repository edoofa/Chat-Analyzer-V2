2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
04/10/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 189 0220: Noted ma'am
04/10/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
04/10/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

*African Schools Education Reform Mission

2. What do you understand from Project 1?

The first project is there to groom the skills of proud Edoofians through building a network of partner companies and potential employers.In this project one has to be connected with organisations or companies in the local region so as to connect them with the Edoofa officials.

3. What do you understand from Project 2?
The second project is aimed at recruiting more students into the Edoofa program thus promoting the local communities as children will get an opportunity to study abroad.This also sharpens the skills of a proud Edoofian which include communication skills among others.

4. What do you understand from Project 3?
The third project is on the African Schools Education Reform Mission whereby the proud Edoofian will identify schools in the region as well as the individuals incharge of making decisions at those schools and connect them with the Edoofa officials so as to officiate a contract between the two that will help the senior students after their secondary school studies as they would attain scholarship through the Edoofa program

13/10/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
13/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 189 0220: I am a proud Edoofian 😁

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 15, 2023*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
