08/08/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/08/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 356 4124: I do agree with you
08/08/23, 3:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great, Now it is time to wrap up. *I will see you tomorrow at 1:30 pm.* So Kindly be on time.

I think by then would have made a plan to recharger my phone
10/08/23, 1:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon

11/08/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
How are you doing?
11/08/23, 1:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please excuse me for the late reply. By the time you texted, it was quite late in India. Let me highlight the time difference here in India, it is 03:30 hours. My working hours are:
07:30 AM-04:30 PM I Monday-Friday
07:30 AM-01:30 PM I Saturday
The organization remains closed on Sundays.

11/08/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time, we were discussing the Project 3. Do you remember that?
11/08/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes l do
11/08/23, 1:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
11/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Oky noted
11/08/23, 2:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
11/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 356 4124: Yes l am
11/08/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
11/08/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],
I hope you are in good health and high spirits.
I am writing to you as a proud beneficiary of the esteemed _Edoofa Scholarship Program_ and I feel privileged to have the opportunity to connect with you today.

In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement. So, *_We won't be having sessions on Monday_*

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Wednesday i.e 15 November 2023 from 9:30 am to 11:00 am* <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 10:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
