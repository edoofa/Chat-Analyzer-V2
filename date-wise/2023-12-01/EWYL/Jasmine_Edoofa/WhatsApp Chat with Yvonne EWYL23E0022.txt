As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️
15/08/23, 1:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do let me know how you have celebrated the day ☺️
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_* ☺️

I hope you are doing well and I trust you are settling in well.🌟  Now, I am more than excited to recommence your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program. I am thrilled to collaborate with you again and set new goals and now there will be no limitations on your earning potential.

*Dedicating just one hour of focused effort each day will enable you to achieve earnings of up to $900*. To provide you with a comprehensive understanding of this opportunity, I have organized an official *orientation call* 📞 
This call is designed to ensure that *_both you and your parents are fully informed and aligned_*
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great
16/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 411 2010: That is great

I hope you all are in great health and spirits. So, the day has come when I will be explaining to you about the *EDOOFA GRANT 2023* 🎓
There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 17-08-2023 at -

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want _you to read the Grant Letter that was shared by me along with the document shared below._ Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
17/08/23, 10:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 519 9602: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine. Thank you will see you then at that time.

17/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 411 2010: Yes ma'am
17/08/23, 3:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
17/08/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 411 2010: Well we choose the scholarship over the grant
17/08/23, 3:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You don't have to decide right now dear.
17/08/23, 3:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We will see that at the time when you have to pay your fees. <This message was edited>
17/08/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 519 9602: Well like I said before, thank you so much for the work you are doing. I feel so proud for sure.
17/08/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 519 9602: She should keep pushing to earn higher credits. Hard work pays off.
17/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 519 9602: So for that other project she was doing whilst in Zimbabwe. Whereby she had to recruit other students. Is this still applicable now that she is in India?
17/08/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 519 9602: So that $200 she has been offered for 2023 it's still valid until when? Because I am not very sure how the semesters are divided. I just know each semester is about six months. But I don't know like this first semester when has it really started and when will it end?
17/08/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, The project is still there but now the reward and has increased to 300$ per student. I will explain more about this on the call.
17/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 411 2010: Noted

17/08/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You have to pay the fees in the starting of every semester.
17/08/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 411 2010: Ooh I understand
17/08/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
17/08/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 411 2010: Understood
17/08/23, 4:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟

I want to reassure you that *duty leave will be granted to those who attend the event*, as this orientation holds significant importance for you as it would be an enlightening event for you. Additionally, it's *crucial that you also fill out the RSVP form.*
 Please note that if you fail to complete either of these requirements, attendance won't be granted.

Your presence is highly valued, and I hope to see you at the event.♥️
02/09/23, 11:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Greetings @263774112010 @263774339451 @263775199602 
I hope this message finds you well. *We wanted to inform you that the grant revocation process has been initiated and will be finalized by Monday morning.*

These next 24 hours represent your final opportunity to avail the grant. We kindly request that you submit the signed copy of the grant letter along with your reason for the delay in submitting the grant letter before the process concludes.

02/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 519 9602: Hello Ms Jasmine how are you doing? Sorry on the grant letter issue. My daughter said she isn't going to sign it because she will lose the scholarship if she does so
02/09/23, 1:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes please
02/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 519 9602: So she's not to sign it if thus the case then
04/09/23, 10:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning,
I hope you are doing well. I think there is some sort of confusion and you have not read the Grant letter and the FAQ properly. Yvonne is not going to loose the scholarship if she signs up the Grant letter. 
The only thing is that in the even semester, she can redeem only one of the two, Either the Grant or the Scholrship Credits, depending upon whichever is highest.
04/09/23, 10:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would suggest you and Yvonne to kindly read the document again.
04/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 519 9602: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine. Oh I hear you now. Some of the things I just have to hear from her because she knows better than I. Thank you for the clarity.

08/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 519 9602: I don't know why there was a mix up of events. Because she said she was doing a practical hence it clashed. Were the other departments not notified of the event? So that they could have put the lessons on hold?
08/09/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The lessons were not supposed to be put on hold. She would have gotten Duty Leave which means she would have not been marked absent. There were students who came to the event after completing their lessons so that she didn't miss the orientation. But realizing that Yvonne missed the orientation is really heartbreaking because I wanted to meet her.
08/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 519 9602: I am so sorry on behalf of my daughter. I hope she won't make the same mistake in future .

11/10/23, 3:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let's begin our session for today. First, kindly respond to the following questions with either "Yes" or "No":
1. Have you shared your photograph with me?
2. Have you provided your Facebook username?
3. Have you shared your Instagram username?
4. Have you written a review on Google and shared the screenshot with me?

11/10/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'd like to discuss our "Star of the Month" initiative, which is our $300 plan. Let me clarify why we introduced this plan. It's designed to help you achieve maximum results with minimal effort. 

However, it's crucial to use your smart strategies when reaching out to students. Are you employing effective tactics maximizing the potential of this plan and using smart methods to make the most out of this plan?
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - +91 86990 56373: I am getting there <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us don't have a good understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, we expect that the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
11/10/23, 4:12 pm - +91 86990 56373: Yes I agree with you
11/10/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - +91 86990 56373: Yes
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, the purpose behind creating this video is to ensure that you provide accurate and precise information to the students. Once you submit the video to me, I'll review and approve it. After that, you can share your video with the students. Does this clarify things for you?
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - +91 86990 56373: Yes
11/10/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 4:32 pm - +91 86990 56373: I will try my best to get it done
11/10/23, 7:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, it was wonderful talking to you. I hope you had a good time as well. I truly value your active participation. I'll be in touch soon, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams.

I hope you are doing well. As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️
