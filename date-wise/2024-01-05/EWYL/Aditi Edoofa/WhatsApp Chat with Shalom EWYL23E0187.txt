Hope you are well.

First of all, I would like to tell you that Mr. Milan is not in this group, but may I know what happened on your side. I think there must be some kind of misunderstanding, did you have a conversation about this with the DSW Team or Mr. Milan?
2/1/24, 3:20 PM - +91 70272 84942: Yes I told Mr Millan about it and he kept on saying I have $444 balance
2/1/24, 3:25 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I think there might be some misunderstanding, I would like you to clear this out okay?
And if there is any issue let me know.
