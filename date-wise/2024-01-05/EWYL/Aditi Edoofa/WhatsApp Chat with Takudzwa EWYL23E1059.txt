So are you ready for today's session?
29/12/23, 8:40 AM - +263 78 749 5077: Morning how are you,we are very well
29/12/23, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's great, I am also well. Thank you!
29/12/23, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be Takudzwa's mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for his application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback from his counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of his application, particularly his desire to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of collective growth has always been my interest.
29/12/23, 9:03 AM - +263 78 749 5077: It's my pleasure to meet you
29/12/23, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Same here!
29/12/23, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are? <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 9:08 AM - +263 78 749 5077: No
29/12/23, 9:09 AM - +263 78 749 5077: May you please let me know
29/12/23, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Takudzwa* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals. <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 9:15 AM - +263 78 749 5077: Thank you
29/12/23, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
29/12/23, 9:41 AM - +263 78 749 5077: That's great and wonderful.
29/12/23, 9:41 AM - +263 78 749 5077: I am facing some network challenges
29/12/23, 9:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
29/12/23, 9:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now we are concluding our session!
As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊
29/12/23, 9:47 AM - +263 78 749 5077: I wish you a happy and prosperous new year as well
