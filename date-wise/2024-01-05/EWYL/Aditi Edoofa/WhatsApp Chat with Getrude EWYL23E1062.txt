2/1/24, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @260972413156 I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
2/1/24, 9:00 AM - +260 96 3297443: Gud morning
2/1/24, 9:02 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
2/1/24, 9:08 AM - +260 97 2413156: My long term goals are to be a prosperous programmer who will be working in the highest institutions in the world and the EWYL program will help me earn reduction on the cost that is to be paid for my education in such a way that I'll be eligible to study at the best schools and attain the best education.
2/1/24, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's an incredible vision! 🚀 Becoming a prosperous programmer and working in top-notch institutions worldwide is a fantastic goal.  The EWYL program is indeed a perfect step toward making your dreams more achievable. 🎓
2/1/24, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 9:11 AM - +260 97 2413156: I don't really understand
2/1/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, let me help you.
2/1/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - +260 97 2413156: Noted.
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/1/24, 9:18 AM - +260 97 2413156: Alright madam
2/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/1/24, 9:22 AM - +260 97 2413156: Yes
2/1/24, 9:25 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

2/1/24, 9:26 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 9:38 AM - +260 97 2413156: I've gone through all the letters
2/1/24, 9:38 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?

4/1/24, 9:14 AM - +260 96 3297443: 🙏
4/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
4/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.

4/1/24, 9:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: We will pause our discussions now and resume at 1:30 PM, okay?
Be on time.
4/1/24, 9:47 AM - +260 97 2413156: Alright.
4/1/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So are you ready for the session now?🚀
4/1/24, 1:37 PM - +260 97 2413156: Yes
4/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
4/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 2:19 PM - +260 97 2413156: I'm done going through
4/1/24, 2:21 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
4/1/24, 2:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session.🌻
4/1/24, 2:39 PM - +260 97 2413156: And from my reading I have gotten to understand that with the EWYL program you can learn yourself money to reduce your costs.How??
Through the connection of yourself to the company or organization this will earn you $20,when you organize a call for EDOOFA mangers and the company this will earn you $2 and if you don't connected to companies instead you can connect to schools and the pupils or students get in enrollment $30 this under the comparative alliance.
And under the community building
Students will reach out to schools like thier on former school and offer them an opportunity to be part of the EDOOFA schoolarship program therefore for every student that gets enrolled and pays thier first enrollment fee the student earns themselves $20 and for the students completion on the Admission formalities on university the students earns themselves $30
And thier is an extra $5 to be earned with the EDOOFA team clarifys everything.
4/1/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
4/1/24, 2:42 PM - +260 97 2413156: Alright thank you.
