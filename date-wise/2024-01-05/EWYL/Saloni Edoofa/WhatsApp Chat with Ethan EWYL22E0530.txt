26/12/23, 10:28 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes indeed!
26/12/23, 10:28 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Coming to this, may I know if you were able to form the group?
26/12/23, 10:29 AM - +263 78 019 2260: Not yet 
I will create it today
26/12/23, 10:33 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, may I know if you are clear with the process?
26/12/23, 10:34 AM - +263 78 019 2260: Yes the process is clear to me
26/12/23, 10:36 AM - Saloni Edoofa: You can physically visit schools and reach out to students, where you can share information about Edoofa:
26/12/23, 10:36 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Introduction to Edoofa*:
Explain what Edoofa is and the unique opportunities it offers for education in India.
*Introduction of Yourself*:

*Purpose of Edoofa*:
Communicate the purpose of Edoofa, emphasizing its commitment to transforming lives through education.

26/12/23, 10:36 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Your Journey So Far*:
Share your journey with Edoofa, providing a relatable perspective.
*Transformational Impact*:
Highlight how Edoofa can transform their lives and open doors to exciting opportunities.
Physically visiting schools adds a personal touch to text messages, allowing for on-the-spot clarification of doubts. You can directly encourage them to fill out the student application form instantly.
26/12/23, 10:37 AM - +263 78 019 2260: Yaah that was my plan but Currently the schools are closed so will go there when they open
26/12/23, 10:41 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Sure that is alright!
26/12/23, 10:41 AM - Saloni Edoofa: One-on-one conversations have altogether different impact. It has a lot of impact on their perspective of Edoofa. Once you approach any individual, you must talk about these few things with them:
26/12/23, 10:42 AM - Saloni Edoofa: 1. Introduce yourself as a student ambassador of Edoofa, and tell about what were your initial thoughts about Edoofa and how this process started. Talk about how you started with the counseling process, clarifying your doubts with your dedicated counselor, choosing the right course, how Inia can be the right destination, and then finally passing the eligibility tests. 
2. Then tell me about starting with your Admission process who will help you in choosing the right University, documentation work, Visa process, travel arrangements, getting the offer letter from the Universities, and many more.
3. Then tell them about the EWYL Program. Through this scholarship Program, they have already reduced their University fees, and through this program, they can reduce their University fees partially or fully. Tell them about how they can upskill themselves through weekly lessons, activities, and newsletters, and how they can earn virtual scholarship credits that can be adjusted in their University fees.
4. Then share them about the Department of Student Welfare. This is a specialized Department that we have created to cater to the needs and requirements of our Indian Edoofians. Unlike any agent who abandons them, our specialized department helps them with the registration process, accommodation, and other administrative process.
26/12/23, 10:44 AM - +263 78 019 2260: One on one interaction is actually powerful because you would be able to convince the person more quickly and easily
26/12/23, 10:48 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, did you have a chance to do so?
26/12/23, 10:49 AM - +263 78 019 2260: I'm waiting for schools to open so that I will go there and look for students
26/12/23, 10:54 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, but meanwhile did you take to your friends and neighbours?
26/12/23, 10:58 AM - +263 78 019 2260: Currently in my home area there are no A level students nor higher O level students .
There are only primary students and many who are in form 1
26/12/23, 11:03 AM - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 10:00-11:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there

26/12/23, 11:04 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Oh, I understand that!
26/12/23, 11:06 AM - +263 78 019 2260: But I will try to look in my nearby towns
26/12/23, 3:47 PM - Saloni Edoofa: That will be great!

Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve that.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

2/1/24, 10:32 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Coming back to the session, may I know if you were able to form the group? <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 78 019 2260: Yaah I formed the group
2/1/24, 10:38 AM - +263 78 019 2260: So what should I name the group
2/1/24, 10:40 AM - Saloni Edoofa: *Ethan/Saloni/2JAN2024*
2/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 019 2260: OK it's fine
2/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 019 2260: So let me add you in the group
2/1/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing Ethan!
2/1/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
2/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 019 2260: So I'm now looking for more people to join the group
2/1/24, 10:59 AM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few.
