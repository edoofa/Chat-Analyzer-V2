I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 2:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I was so excited to talk to you about the Christmas celebrations, however, you did not show up! May I ask if you are facing any challenges?
27/12/23, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Hilda! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄

27/12/23, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday : 9:30 a.m to 11:00 a.m
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
27/12/23, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
28/12/23, 9:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Hilda!

It's your first session over the line, and I am waiting for you. Kindly join the line so that we can begin our new journey of exploring projects together!🤝🏽
28/12/23, 10:19 AM - +263 77 579 2587: I joined the line, good morning
2/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Hilda!

I hope you had a fantastic New Year! Because of the holiday break, our Monday session had to be canceled, but don't worry about it. I hope you enjoyed the extra time for celebrations.🌟

To make up for it, let's have a special session *tomorrow at 9:30 AM*. Get ready to tell me how you celebrated the New Year, and I'll also share my resolution with you. I'm looking forward to catching up with you!🕤
4/1/24, 10:04 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Hilda!

How are you doing today? I've noticed you haven't attended your last two sessions with me. Since you always attend your sessions, I am quite worried. Are you alright?
