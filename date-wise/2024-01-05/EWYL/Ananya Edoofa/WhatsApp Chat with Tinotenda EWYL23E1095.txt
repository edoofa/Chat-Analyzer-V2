If you join in the latter half of that time, it will be challenging for us to complete our session in a fruitful manner. I trust you understand that attending sessions on time is crucial for earning credits.

I expect a level of sincerity from a dedicated student like you. Moving forward, I hope you will connect with me promptly at 8:30 a.m. in the morning. <This message was edited>
