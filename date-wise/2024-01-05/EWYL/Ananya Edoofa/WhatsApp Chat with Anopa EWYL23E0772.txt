I have observed that you have not been consistent and punctual in attending your sessions. As your mentor, I am concerned about your progress, and I would like you to discuss with me if you are facing any challenges. How will we learn and earn credits if you do not attend the sessions on time?

2/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄
