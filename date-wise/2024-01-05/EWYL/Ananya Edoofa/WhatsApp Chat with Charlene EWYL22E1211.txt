23/12/23, 12:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Charlene!

How are you today? I understand it's the holiday season, but there's a crucial hands-on training session for the $300 plan in India that has been pending due to many factors or challenges you were facing. I was hoping to complete that training today. I've set aside a 30-minute slot specifically for you because I know how important it is for you to progress and work hard, earning credits just like your fellow Edoofians!

Could you let me know if you are available today at 7:00 p.m.?
