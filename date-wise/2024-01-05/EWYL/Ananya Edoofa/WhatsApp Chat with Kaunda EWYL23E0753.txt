I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!

The current session has commenced, and it appears you're not on your EWYL line. Is it challenging to be present on time? I've noticed a recurring need for reminders. Could we discuss the reason behind this?
