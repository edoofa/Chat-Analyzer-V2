23/12/23, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Thank you
26/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Suprise!

I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 1:43 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes Ms Ananya I really enjoyed, I hope you did too
26/12/23, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:48 PM - +263 71 380 4934: That's a beautiful Xmas tree, I can see you had a blast
26/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Amazing, I'm sure we will achieve those goals
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes
26/12/23, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
26/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: For today, we need to wrap up our session, and we'll continue this discussion in our next session, which is tomorrow at 1:30 p.m!
26/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes Ma'am
26/12/23, 3:06 PM - +263 71 380 4934: I have understood that the projects in the EWYL program are mainly centered on advertising the Edoofa program in my community so that a lot of ambitious individuals who are hungry for success can get the opportunity to make their dreams a reality. On the other hand  this will help me to be socially connected and to be social media literate. Some projects will even take me as far as having to connect with huge companies in my country helping me to know more about how business formalities are handled. I will have to arrange for video calls and facilitating the signing of contracts. In this I will learn how to deal with rejections, failures and help me develop endurance and also the "try, try again, never give up" attitude. The projects will be split into small activities and I will be helped in carrying out these projects. Apart  from all these skills I will also be awarded scholarship credits upon completion of these activities.
27/12/23, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Suprise! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 1:29 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes ma'am 😅
Afternoon
27/12/23, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
27/12/23, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes ma'am, I'm done
27/12/23, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
27/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 71 380 4934: I have learnt that the best way to do the first project is to connect with my relatives, neighbors and friend's parents who work in the companies of interest and talk to them about edoofa and my project. I would also have to create a LinkedIn account so I have to download the LinkedIn app on play store to research on such companies and talk to the mangers. I will be helped in doing this.
27/12/23, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Suprise. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
27/12/23, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Ok
27/12/23, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
27/12/23, 2:57 PM - +263 71 380 4934: The document was teaching me on how to start the project and help me have an idea of the type of companies that would be the best targets. I have to research on the backgrounds of the founders of the company, their experiences and everything there is to know about them. I got examples of links that would lead me to the backgrounds of certain founders. I also learnt about the platforms that  from which I can get the information that I need on the company of interest. I can also visit their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages and see recent posts. But the best way is to connect with heads of different departments in the companies before reaching out to the founders.
27/12/23, 2:58 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Is there a way to know if the company is already in touch with Edoofa before proceeding with the research
27/12/23, 4:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session earlier. However, since our session time is over, we shall connect tomorrow at the same time.
27/12/23, 5:45 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Suprise!

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count." - Winston Churchill

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!🚀
28/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Afternoon ma'am
I already know that quote from one of the documents you sent😅
28/12/23, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, great!
28/12/23, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:

How did you get in touch with the contact person?
28/12/23, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to

28/12/23, 1:42 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Suprise, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
28/12/23, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
28/12/23, 2:01 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Community building
In this project I have to talk to my friends, relatives or schoolmates about edoofa and if they are interested they would have to talk to their parents. If their parents give a go ahead and Once I see that they are actually serious with the program, then I will have to share with them my knowledge and experience with Edoofa. I would also be given an offline form that I will give them to fill. Once it is filled, I will have to send it to this group. I'm allowed to send only 10 forms per week.
28/12/23, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
28/12/23, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
28/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Understood
28/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
28/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Okay ma'am
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude our session today, reflect on the progress you've made and the insights gained. If there's anything specific you'd like to focus on in our future sessions, feel free to share. Wishing you continued success and looking forward to our next session! 🌟
28/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes ma'am
29/12/23, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Suprise!

Welcome to your last session of 2023!
Let's make it exciting—reflect on your journey this year and share your aspirations for the next. What dreams do you want to chase in 2024?
29/12/23, 1:40 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Good afternoon ma'am
Sure some new year resolutions are already there😅
29/12/23, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Tell me, Suprise?
29/12/23, 1:43 PM - +263 71 380 4934: The first is to attain maximum scholarship credits whilst I'm still here in Zimbabwe
29/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am really happy to hear your aspirations, Suprise!
29/12/23, 1:48 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Thank you ma'am
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, in order to move ahead with your second project, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

29/12/23, 2:11 PM - +263 71 380 4934: So when I start the projects, do I have to do them according to their order, or I can just do them simultaneously
29/12/23, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: You can start doing it right now!
29/12/23, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
29/12/23, 2:22 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:23 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Ok
29/12/23, 2:51 PM - +263 71 380 4934: This project is more like project 1 but an easier version.
This time I'm not going to be talking to any member of the high school but specifically the headmaster. I will tell them how and why I joined edoofa then share the program details with them. I will have to arrange an online meeting between the headmaster and edoofa. I would start with my own school.
29/12/23, 2:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand that we could not have a fruitful session today! Actually, I am facing some technical challenges today! 

As our session concludes, and we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024 and we will resume from 2 January onwards🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄
2/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 380 4934: 😆😆, 
Thank you ma'am
3/1/24, 1:37 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Suprise! 🌞

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Good afternoon mentor
The answer is echo <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely!
3/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Great
3/1/24, 1:43 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
3/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Ok then
3/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
3/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes ma'am, I do have the contact
3/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
3/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
3/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

3/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Ok, I will get started right away ma'am
3/1/24, 2:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now,we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
3/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Regarding project 1, the companies that I'm going to target, are they supposed to be only from Zimbabwe or even from any other country in Africa.
3/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
3/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Understood
3/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

3/1/24, 2:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I know we couldn't have a fruitful session today as I was preparing for something big coming up! I'll share it with you super soon. Meanwhile, let's conclude our session here and connect tomorrow at the same time!🤝🏽
