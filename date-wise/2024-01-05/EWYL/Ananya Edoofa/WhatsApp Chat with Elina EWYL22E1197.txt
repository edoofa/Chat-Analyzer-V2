23/12/23, 1:05 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Elina!

Please excuse me for not being able to connect yesterday. We were celebrating Christmas in our office, and I was occupied with decorating the tree. It went really well!

You all will go at the same time.

26/12/23, 11:16 AM - +91 89680 53859: And you said the grant applies to 2nd semester fees
26/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly connect with the Department of Student Welfare for this matter, as they are the best people to guide you through!
26/12/23, 4:20 PM - +91 89680 53859: You mean the department of student welfare at school?
27/12/23, 8:08 AM - Ananya Edoofa: No, Elina! For the Edoofa's Department of Student Welfare, you can connect through your admissions group.
27/12/23, 3:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Elina,

I hope this message finds you well amidst your ongoing exams. I couldn't help but notice that I haven't received a Christmas greeting from you. I understand that exam preparations are consuming much of your time and energy, but it's disheartening to see that you couldn't spare a couple of minutes to extend your wishes.

As your mentor, I've been supportive and have even provided you with holidays to dedicate to your exam preparations. However, it's disconcerting to witness a lack of acknowledgment or a brief moment taken to convey your holiday wishes.

Is there something on your mind, or is there a reason for this silence?
27/12/23, 4:15 PM - +91 89680 53859: Sorry ms Ananya I've been busy with exams
27/12/23, 4:15 PM - +91 89680 53859: Happy holidays...hope you have a joyous and fulfilled holiday
28/12/23, 4:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Elina!

I understand that things have not always aligned with how they are planned. It's life, dear; one will face many instances in their life. However, moving out of your comfort zone is something you do when you wish to move ahead in your life.

Being your mentor, I am always here to listen and help you. However, I understand that sometimes your mentor can also feel a bit neglected. Therefore, always try to answer or respond to whatever has been asked.

31/12/23, 6:27 PM - +91 89680 53859: Happy new year to you too...hope your new year is filled with blessings and joy all around✨

I was expecting a response from you yesterday. I wanted to discuss the upcoming industrial visit, but you did not show up. Can I know why?
