All of our sessions will be held in the same time span, and hence, we kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots.

26/12/23, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
26/12/23, 3:12 PM - +263 77 952 5708: I understand
26/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
26/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Tuesday (2nd January) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
26/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
26/12/23, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Runyararo EWYL23E0168)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

26/12/23, 5:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

27/12/23, 8:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

29/12/23, 1:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
29/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
29/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes they are
29/12/23, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
29/12/23, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/12/23, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
29/12/23, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
29/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Ye l am
29/12/23, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps - <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
29/12/23, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes they are
29/12/23, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes we can
29/12/23, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/12/23, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

I would love to continue with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
30/12/23, 2:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Runyararo, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I believe you had some challenges as you left the session in between, Hence, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
30/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes l am available
30/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Good afternoon
30/12/23, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response @263779525708, May I know if you have gone through the videos?
30/12/23, 2:17 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes l have
30/12/23, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
30/12/23, 2:36 PM - +263 77 952 5708: I understood that Edoofa helps students get scholarships from other universities in India and not just that they also help you apply and they will be with you throughout the whole process
30/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263779525708, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
30/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
30/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
30/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
30/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
30/12/23, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
30/12/23, 3:24 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes l understood
30/12/23, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
30/12/23, 3:26 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes we are
30/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tuesday 1:00 PM.
30/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

30/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
30/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
30/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

30/12/23, 4:14 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Okay..thank you

3/1/24, 8:21 PM - +263 77 952 5708: 2.The BPM lifecycle is comprised of five phases which are  process design, modeling, execution, monitoring, and optimization. Each phase of the lifecycle builds on the previous one, and the result is an efficient and effective business process management system that meets the needs of the business.
The first cycle which is Process design is the foundation of a successful BPM initiative and is all about understanding the current state of your business processes and developing an improvement plan
The second step in the cycle which is modeling and the first thing you need to do when modeling your business processes is to identify the inputs and outputs of each process. The inputs are anything that goes into process like raw material and outputs are anything that comes out of the process like finished goods.
This is a brief introduction about BPM.

3.Businesses contribute to economic development by enhancing the standard of living for individuals and communities by setting up industries and creating wealth and new positions.Businesses  not only provides large-scale employment and ways to generate income, it also has the potential to improve the quality of individual life by developing products and services that are affordable to everyone and does not cause the segregation or classes, safe to use so that people do not react and get sick with the priducts. They also introduce new products and services that remove the scarcity of essential commodities meaning that everyone will now have access to essential goods they need.

4. In 2018 l was made the team captain for soccer and l was also the keeper. It was my responsibility to lead the team and at the same time l have to make sure that the other team does not win. Being a team captain as the same as being a leader which means you are in charge and you have to manage the team and see that everyone and everything is in order. My task was to make sure that we have all the training kit and everyone is healthy whilst everything is in place.i think this is when l showed my managerial skills

5.Human resources  is the division of an organization that is responsible for recruiting, screening, hiring, and training new employees. The importance of human resource in an organisation is that the training and development area of HR also provides training that will enhance the skills of employees. Also they implement effective performance management systems, establish clear job expectations to employees.
They provide a safe working environment for everyone and ensures that everyone is happy and working under healthy conditions.

3/1/24, 8:22 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Good evening

3/1/24, 8:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response, I will check with your mentor tomorrow. May I know when you would like to connect with us for the discussion tomorrow  ?
3/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 952 5708: 2 pm is okay
3/1/24, 8:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263779525708
4/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Runyararo, I hope you are doing well.
4/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With respect to your admission journey, I would like to connect with you today and move ahead with your journey. Could you please share your response with us ?
4/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Good afternoon
4/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to connect with you today. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BBA* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
4/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes but l wanted to ask if it's possible for me to change courses after results or right now
4/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know which course you want to pursue ?
4/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 952 5708: I was thinking Of Accounting
4/1/24, 2:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, May I know why you want to pursue Accounting?
4/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 952 5708: The reason why l chose business was because I thought that Accounting was hard but when l did more research about it l noticed that it's not..it's all about the dedication and time
4/1/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright! So going through your statement of entry which you've shared, I would recommend a course for you by analysis of your hobbies passion and career inclination and my expertise so the course is
 *Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting*
4/1/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So may I know does this course aligns you and May I know if you've managed to do any research about this course, please?
4/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Okay.Thank you
But l will have to research about it first then l get back to you
4/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please take your time and do let us know. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
4/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
4/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
4/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
4/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Thank you.l understand
4/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
4/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
4/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
4/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes
4/1/24, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
4/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes we are
4/1/24, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
4/1/24, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
4/1/24, 3:21 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes l have
4/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
4/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
4/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Okay
I understand
4/1/24, 3:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
4/1/24, 3:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
4/1/24, 3:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
4/1/24, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This message was deleted
4/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Okay
4/1/24, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
4/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 77 952 5708: No l have no queries
4/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
4/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
4/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
4/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Thank you
4/1/24, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263779525708, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities.
