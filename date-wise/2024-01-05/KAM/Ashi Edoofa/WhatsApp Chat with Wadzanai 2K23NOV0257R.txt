2/1/24, 9:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome dear
3/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Wadzanai , I hope you are doing well. 

In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
3/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
3/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Let's start our discussion.  The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
3/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
3/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Thats something remarkable to know
3/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
3/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
3/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
3/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
3/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 617 6748: I have gone through the benefits
3/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
3/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
3/1/24, 2:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
3/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 617 6748: I am following
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
3/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
3/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
3/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
3/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
3/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 30, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 30, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
3/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Not as of now
3/1/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - +263 71 617 6748: No l am not familiar with the process
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
3/1/24, 3:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
3/1/24, 3:16 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes of course
3/1/24, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
3/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes
3/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
3/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
3/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
3/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Clear
3/1/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
3/1/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
3/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes l am
3/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
3/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
3/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 71 617 6748: That's understood
3/1/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
3/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 71 617 6748: For now l have no queries but if l happen to have one l will do ask.
3/1/24, 3:42 PM - +263 71 617 6748: But l would like to know about the costs of my admission process and higher education
3/1/24, 3:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, The total cost of your education will be in the shared range which is $2700 - $3700 and the registration fees will be in the range of $500 - $1000. Please note that the registration fees is included in your first year tuition fees.
3/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Okay thank you
3/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
3/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
3/1/24, 3:52 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Well my parents were not present for this discussion ,lm sure they will have a follow up of these benefits and also hope for their approval
3/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, I would like to connect with them
3/1/24, 3:58 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Once they have a follow up of the discussion they will connect with you as they are not available at the moment ,thank you
3/1/24, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Have a good day ahead!
3/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 71 617 6748: A good day to you too
3/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you dear
4/1/24, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Wadzanai, I hope you are doing well.
4/1/24, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you have connected with your parents regarding your remaining enrollment fees ?
4/1/24, 8:32 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Good evening Ma'am
4/1/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear
4/1/24, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have you gone through my above message ? <This message was edited>
4/1/24, 8:40 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Yes l have and they claim that they may not afford these figures if lm willing   for admission this year.However they said if it is possible to change  my year of admission they might get enough time to arrange for these figures.So l was hoping to ask if this request l have to change my year of admission is possible
4/1/24, 8:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263716176748 I am confused with your message, you mentioned earlier that with the benefits shared by Mr. Shivjeet you will be able to complete procedure. What happened dear?
4/1/24, 8:50 PM - +263 71 617 6748: There might have been a mistake as l meant to say that l may not be able to complete the procedure  and that was the reason l was requesting for changing the year .
4/1/24, 8:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Why you want to change your academic year ?
4/1/24, 8:56 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Well my parents realised that they will not afford the the registration fee
4/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 71 617 6748: And also considering other shortcomings that may require payment
4/1/24, 8:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263716176748But you have not received your offer letter yet why are you making these decision as of now ?
4/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 71 617 6748: Well that is because  they are barely able to complete the other part of the enrolment ,so completing the process is definitely going to be difficult,that is why changing the year is important because at least by then they will be fully prepared and also have a proper budget
4/1/24, 9:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, In that case I would like to know when are you planning to complete the remaining enrollment fees?
4/1/24, 9:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As even if we requested the officials, you need to complete the procedure first
4/1/24, 9:10 PM - +263 71 617 6748: I am not sure ,but l will keep communicating
4/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, Kindly have a discussion with your parents about our today's conversation and then we will reconnect with you tomorrow to discuss further.
4/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Wishing you a good night ahead!
