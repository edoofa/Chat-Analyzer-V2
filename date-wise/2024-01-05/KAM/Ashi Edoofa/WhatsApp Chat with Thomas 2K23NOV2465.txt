28/12/23, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
28/12/23, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
28/12/23, 3:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 4:00 PM - +263 78 814 9138: they are clear l am.understanding them
28/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
28/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
28/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 78 814 9138: yes I am following
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - +263 78 814 9138: they are clear
28/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/12/23, 4:10 PM - +263 78 814 9138: yes we may start
28/12/23, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/12/23, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
28/12/23, 4:12 PM - +263 78 814 9138: we may move forward
28/12/23, 4:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me share the videos with you, I am sure you must be excited for the videos.

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

28/12/23, 8:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 3:00 pm for our next session.

29/12/23, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Thomas,

I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best spirits. While I was organizing my day, I went through your scholarship application file to prepare for our session at 03:00 PM, and I noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of the remaining part of the $150 for your Edoofa Enrollment fee by tomorrow - the 31st December 2023. 

Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far. Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction and make the payment of your fee?
30/12/23, 7:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Thomas,

3/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Thomas, I hope you are doing well. 

I wanted to follow up regarding the videos that were shared with you. Were you able to review all four of them? I am keen to discuss them further and would greatly appreciate your feedback.
3/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 814 9138: good afternoon
3/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 814 9138: l was able to review all the four videos which you shared with me
3/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
3/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 78 814 9138: The videos go through how scholarships are not just for the fact that one is learning, but the Edoofa helps one to grow. ln the first video l got that for everything to go well for one to enroll the students should follow instructions and should be open minded during interactions and sessions with Mentors and admission officers
3/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 814 9138: The videos also go through a lot for example the second video talks about the vision which Edoofa has for the students which is molding good characters and character traits that distinguish a successful student from the rest
3/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 814 9138: l understood that Edoofa also goes all the way to ensure that students get admitted to Universities that they know can provide standard education for students and l understand the efforts that the Edoofa founders have been doing in order to discover these learning institutions
3/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 814 9138: Lastly I understood r the most important step is writing a Statement O Purpose which once given to students should be swiftly attended to
3/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263788149138, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
3/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
3/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
3/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
3/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
3/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
