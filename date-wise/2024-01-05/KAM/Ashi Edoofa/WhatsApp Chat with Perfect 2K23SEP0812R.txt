For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 3:34 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Of course
28/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 3:40 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Done
28/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
28/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
28/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
28/12/23, 3:53 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Clear
28/12/23, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
28/12/23, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
28/12/23, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Yes i am
28/12/23, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
28/12/23, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/12/23, 3:57 PM - +263 78 098 4146: You can proceed
28/12/23, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
28/12/23, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
28/12/23, 3:59 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Very clear
28/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/12/23, 4:07 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Yes
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

They are also like parents to us and they always want the best for us
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear,  Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
29/12/23, 3:29 PM - +263 78 098 4146: I agree
29/12/23, 3:31 PM - +263 78 098 4146: And i understood
29/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
29/12/23, 3:40 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Yes
29/12/23, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
29/12/23, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
29/12/23, 4:11 PM - +263 78 098 4146: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, I was waiting for your response although it seems like you were unavailable. I would love to continue with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
30/12/23, 8:22 AM - +263 78 098 4146: There are two laws of thermodynamics, the zeroth and first. The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. In other words, if object A is in thermal equilibrium with object B, and object B is in thermal equilibrium with object C, then object A and object C must also be in thermal equilibrium with each other. This is a foundational concept in the study of thermodynamics.
30/12/23, 8:22 AM - +263 78 098 4146: The first law of thermodynamics can be explained using the concept of the internal energy of a system. Internal energy is the total energy of a system, including its potential and kinetic energy. The first law states that the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. In other words, if the internal energy of a system increases, it means that heat has been added to the system or work has been done on the system.
This law is important because it allows us to understand how energy is transferred between systems. It also provides a framework
The first law of thermodynamics can be explained in more detail using the concept of the internal energy of a system.

30/12/23, 8:22 AM - +263 78 098 4146: A valve is a device that controls the flow of fluids through a system. Valves can be used to control the flow of gases, liquids, or both. They are commonly used in many different types of systems, including plumbing systems, engine systems, and industrial processes.
30/12/23, 8:22 AM - +263 78 098 4146: A butterfly valve is a type of valve that is used to regulate the flow of fluids. It is named for its shape, which resembles a butterfly with its wings spread open. Butterfly valves consist of a rotating disc or "butterfly" that is positioned in the center of the valve body. When the butterfly is open, fluid can flow freely through the valve. When the butterfly is closed, the fluid is stopped or restricted. Butterfly valves are often used in applications where a quick and efficient flow control is needed. They are commonly used in chemical plants, power plants, and water treatment facilities.
30/12/23, 8:22 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Heat treatment is a process that is used to change the physical properties of metals and other materials. The process involves heating the material to a specific temperature and then cooling it in a controlled manner. This can alter the microstructure of the material, changing its strength, hardness, and other properties. Heat treatment is commonly used in manufacturing to improve the performance of materials and extend their life. It can also be used to improve the safety and reliability of components. Common heat treatment processes include annealing, normalizing, tempering, and quenching.
30/12/23, 8:22 AM - +263 78 098 4146: Compressors are devices that are used to increase the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume. They are a type of positive displacement pump, which means that they work by trapping a fixed amount of gas in a chamber and then increasing the pressure by reducing the volume of the chamber. There are many different types of compressors, including reciprocating, rotary, screw, and centrifugal compressors
30/12/23, 8:22 AM - +263 78 098 4146: The most common type of compressor used in gas turbines is the centrifugal compressor. Centrifugal compressors have several advantages that make them well-suited for use in gas turbines, including their high efficiency, compact size, and ability to handle large volumes of gas. They are also relatively inexpensive to manufacture and have a long lifespan. In some cases, axial compressors may also be used in gas turbines. Axial compressors have a higher efficiency than centrifugal compressors, but they are more complex and expensive to manufacture.

30/12/23, 2:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Perfect, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I believe you had some challenges as you left the session in between, Hence, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
30/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Good afternoon
Sorry i had to leave ,not feeling good
30/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: What happened dear?
30/12/23, 2:26 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Havin a headache
30/12/23, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Please take some rest
30/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok thanks
30/12/23, 7:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Perfect ,

30/12/23, 7:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 11:13 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Thank you A happy new year to u as well
30/12/23, 11:13 PM - +263 78 098 4146: The time is very convenient
2/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Perfect,

I hope this message finds you well. In regards to my previous messages, I wanted to share that I am looking forward for our discussion today regarding your admission journey. I am here at the scheduled time and am looking forward to our conversation. Please let me know if you are available for the discussion.

I am genuinely excited and eagerly awaiting your response.
2/1/24, 4:42 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Afternoon
2/1/24, 4:42 PM - +263 78 098 4146: We can proceed
2/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (5-Jan-2024). <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 4:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/Dpyh22gT7Q6DIX8X4oYDrK
2/1/24, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Perfect Pedzisai, and my EWYL group name is Perfect EWYL23E0672. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (5-Jan-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
2/1/24, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
2/1/24, 4:51 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Noted
2/1/24, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have taken a note of my messages. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
2/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 78 098 4146: that is true
2/1/24, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
2/1/24, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
2/1/24, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
2/1/24, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
2/1/24, 5:06 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Yes, what will be the way forward then in that case
2/1/24, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
2/1/24, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
2/1/24, 5:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
2/1/24, 5:13 PM - +263 78 098 4146: She did
2/1/24, 5:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
2/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Yes we are
2/1/24, 5:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
2/1/24, 5:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
2/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Im following
2/1/24, 5:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
2/1/24, 5:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
2/1/24, 5:48 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Noted
2/1/24, 5:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
2/1/24, 5:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
2/1/24, 5:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
2/1/24, 5:51 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok
2/1/24, 5:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 6:09 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Lets say using your example the following years, the amount to be paid will be constant at 2050 without considering EWYL credits
2/1/24, 6:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263780984146 Please elaborate your question dear
2/1/24, 6:26 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Lyk from the example, you said 750 registration 1800 tuition 1000 food n accommodation for first year
In the second there wont be any registration
2/1/24, 6:28 PM - +263 78 098 4146: So will there just be 1800 tuition and 1000 food n accomodation or there might be additional costs too
2/1/24, 6:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, the registration fees is only for first year.
2/1/24, 6:44 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok
2/1/24, 6:44 PM - +263 78 098 4146: No more additional costs the next years right
2/1/24, 6:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear, You will get the better understanding when you will receive your offer letter
2/1/24, 6:52 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok that's good
2/1/24, 6:53 PM - +263 78 098 4146: No more questions
2/1/24, 6:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
2/1/24, 6:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
2/1/24, 6:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
2/1/24, 6:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 7:24 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Do offer letters come to my email or u sent them in here
2/1/24, 7:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Your offer letter will be shared in your email and we will also share it with you here
2/1/24, 7:27 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok
2/1/24, 7:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
2/1/24, 7:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
2/1/24, 7:33 PM - +263 78 098 4146: that's good to hear
2/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
2/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
2/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
2/1/24, 7:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
2/1/24, 7:41 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Done
2/1/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
2/1/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
2/1/24, 7:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
2/1/24, 7:50 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok done
2/1/24, 7:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
2/1/24, 7:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
2/1/24, 7:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 7:53 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Yes yes
2/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
2/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750 . Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 8:07 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Yes it does
2/1/24, 8:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
2/1/24, 8:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/1/24, 8:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $325 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/1/24, 8:20 PM - +263 78 098 4146: No
2/1/24, 8:20 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Proceed
2/1/24, 8:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
2/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 78 098 4146: More infor please
2/1/24, 8:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
2/1/24, 8:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
2/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
2/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
2/1/24, 9:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263780984146 Are we still connected?
2/1/24, 11:06 PM - +263 78 098 4146: All clear
2/1/24, 11:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As I am waiting for your response dear, However, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
2/1/24, 11:07 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok gud
3/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Perfect, I hope you are doing well. 

In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
3/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ye i am now
3/1/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
3/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Yes they wont
3/1/24, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
3/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 098 4146: I agree
3/1/24, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
3/1/24, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
3/1/24, 3:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
3/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok thats gud im clear
3/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
3/1/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
3/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Yes im clear
3/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
3/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
3/1/24, 3:32 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok noted
3/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
3/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 78 098 4146: No
3/1/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
3/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Yes
3/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, But we need your A level document in order to process you application. May I know by when you will be able to share it with us ?
3/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Im going there on the 8th holidays will be over
3/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 78 098 4146: statement of entry or recommendation
3/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please make sure to share your Statement of Entry and Recommendation Letter both of them with us as they are required for your application.
3/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 098 4146: Ok
3/1/24, 3:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Have a good day ahead!

3/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome, Perfect!
4/1/24, 8:49 AM - +263 78 098 4146: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms. Ananya and she has scheduled my session for 5 January 2024*
