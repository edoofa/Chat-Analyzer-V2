I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Quest Group of  Institutions.

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Quest Group of  Institutions as a collective?

During the past couple of days, in our discussion of the offer letter, it has been noticed that there have been irregularities in our sessions, leading to a delay in the registration process. I understand that there might be some challenges that you are currently facing, which has led to this inconsistency, and as your admission officer, I am always ready to help you out here. If it's the timing of our session, you can also let me know so that we can schedule our session at your convenience to complete the procedure.
4/1/24, 10:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, as we continue to face these inconsistencies in our sessions, you have missed the deadline date for the registration process at Quest Group of Institutions. I want you to secure this offer letter to make your future dreams come true, as it has been my sole responsibility since I became your admission officer. So, if you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that we can find a solution and proceed with the detailed discussion of the offer letter and plan your finances together.

4/1/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear that you are having financial concern at the moment and you are trying to complete the payment. Ideally, a student needs to make the payment of the university registration fee by the mentioned deadline as the seats are reserved for you and there are limited seats for this scholarship opportunity. I understand that you are facing financial challenges at the moment, and we will try our best to assist you.

Am happy you have shown and expressed much concerns for us. Financially we have not been stable lately. Given that we now have the two of them on board, Anodiwa and Anesu. We are trying our level best to make sure they both reserve their university seats. And Am proud as an Edoofian that with God everything positive is possible thanks to you. If you may give us upto end of January 2024 to complete registration processes payment for Anodiwa then we go onto Anesu's payments by the end of February 2024 Am sure we will be done. I hope you understand where we are coming from, given that our source of income as a sole proprietory family is meager, so insignificant and easily constrainable.
