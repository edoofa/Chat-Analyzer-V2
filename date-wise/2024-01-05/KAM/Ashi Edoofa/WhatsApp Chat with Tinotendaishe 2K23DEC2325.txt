If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
4/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Okay
4/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Done
4/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
4/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
4/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
4/1/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
4/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 486 3780: The steps are clear
4/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
4/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
4/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
4/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
4/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 486 3780: I am
4/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
4/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
4/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
4/1/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Yes
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
4/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Okay
4/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
4/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
