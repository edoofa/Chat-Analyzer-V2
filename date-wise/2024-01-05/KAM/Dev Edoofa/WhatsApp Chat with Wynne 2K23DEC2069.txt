2/1/24, 2:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: Amazing, Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
2/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh okay okay sir  . I am ready sir
2/1/24, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I am done sir. Thank you
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
2/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 401 8032: They are very clear sir . Thank you for the explanation
2/1/24, 2:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
2/1/24, 2:31 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 401 8032: I am following sir. This is understandable
2/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
2/1/24, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
2/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 401 8032: This is pretty clear sir. Thank you
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
2/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh okay okay sir . We can start
2/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
2/1/24, 2:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
2/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Yes yes I am ready sir
2/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

3/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 2) To be an aerospace engineer, one need to have a combination of technical, analytical, and creative skills. Some of the most important skills for aerospace engineering include

- **Mathematics**: One need to have mathematics skills to perform calculations and apply formulas related to aircraft and spacecraft design, performance, and structures. You also need to be familiar with advanced topics such as calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and statistics.
- **Physics**:One need to have an amazing understanding of physics to analyze the forces, motions, and energies involved in aerospace engineering. You also need to know the principles of aerodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and mechanics.
- **Engineering**: One need to have the ability to engineer or design aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, or other aerospace products and systems. One also need to be able to use engineering tools and software to create models, simulations, and analyses of your designs.
- **Problem-solving**: One need to have the ability to problem-solve and troubleshoot engineering issues that may arise during the design, development, testing, or operation of aerospace products and systems. You also need to be able to find innovative solutions to complex challenges.
- **Creativity**: One need to have the ability to think creatively and innovatively to design and develop new and improved aerospace products and systems. One also need to be able to adapt to changing requirements and technologies in the field.

These are some of the main skills for aerospace engineering, but there are also other skills that may be useful, such as communication, teamwork, project management, and safety.
3/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 3) Aerodynamics is an important concept in the aerospace engineering field. Aerospace engineers use principles of aerodynamics to design aircraft, spacecraft, and other vehicles that can travel through the air or space. They use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to model the airflow around the vehicle and optimize its shape to reduce drag (opposing forces which delay ), increase lift, and improve performance . The aerodynamic performance, such as the lift and drag, of a body is governed by the flow of air across its surface. Applied aerodynamics seeks to understand and utilize the fundamental aspects of this fluid flow in the analysis, design, and integration of aerodynamic geometries . Engineers utilize aerodynamic principles to enhance fuel efficiency, improve stability, and minimize drag .
3/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 4)  Lift augmentation devices are components or mechanisms that increase the amount of lift produced by the wing at low speeds, such as during takeoff(leaving) and landing. They can be classified into two main types: trailing-edge devices and leading-edge devices.

Trailing-edge devices are located on the rear part of the wing and they change the shape and area of the wing when deployed. The most common trailing-edge device is the flap, which can be lowered to increase the camber and chord of the wing, resulting in more lift and drag. There are different types of flaps, such as plainand Fowler flaps, each with different advantages and disadvantages.

Leading-edge devices are located on the front part of the wing and they modify the airflow over the wing when extended. The most common leading-edge device is the slat, which is a small movable surface that creates a gap between itself and the wing, allowing more air to flow over the upper surface of the wing and delaying the stall. Slats can be fixed or retractable, and they can also be combined with flaps to create a powerful high-lift system. Another leading-edge device is the slot, which is a fixed gap that also improves the airflow over the wing and increases the stall angle.

These are some of the lift augmentation devices used in an aircraft .
3/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 71 401 8032: 5)Aviation is a broad field that encompasses many diverse topics and activities related to mechanical flight and the aircraft industrialization. Some of the main areas in aviation include

- **Aircraft design and engineering**: This area involves the creation and development of aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, and other flying vehicles and systems. It requires skills in mathematics, physics, engineering, and problem-solving. Some of the subfields in this area are aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, materials, and control systems.

- **Aircraft operation and maintenance**: This area involves the piloting and servicing of aircraft and their components. It requires skills in flight training, navigation, communication, and safety. Some of the subfields in this area are flight instruction, air traffic control, aircraft mechanic, and avionics technician .
- **Aircraft management and organization**: This area involves the planning and coordination of aviation activities and resources. It requires skills in business, economics, law, and leadership. Some of the subfields in this area are airline management, airport management, aviation consulting, and aviation regulation .

These are some of the main areas in aviation, but there are also other areas that are related to aviation, such as aviation history, aviation research, and aviation journalism.
