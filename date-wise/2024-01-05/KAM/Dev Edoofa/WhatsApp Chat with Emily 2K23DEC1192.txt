I am particularly impressed by the EWYL program l find it rather outstanding that Edoofa gives the students a chance to self-finance their education because l feel that by doing so as students we then not only work hard on the projects but in everyelse we do since we would then be kind of responsible for eduaction in a way

3/1/24, 11:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much! Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
3/1/24, 11:29 AM - +263 77 794 4385: I am ready
3/1/24, 11:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 11:32 AM - +263 77 794 4385: I am done
3/1/24, 11:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/1/24, 11:37 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/1/24, 11:37 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Yes they are
3/1/24, 11:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/1/24, 11:44 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/1/24, 11:45 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Yes I am
3/1/24, 11:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/1/24, 11:49 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/1/24, 11:50 AM - +263 77 794 4385: It was very clear thank yu
3/1/24, 11:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/1/24, 11:57 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Yes that would be great
3/1/24, 11:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/1/24, 11:58 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/1/24, 11:58 AM - +263 77 794 4385: Yes
3/1/24, 11:59 AM - Dev Edoofa: Fantastic! <This message was edited>

4/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 77 794 4385: Edoofa wants to  make sure that children who are in outline spaces are able to access a higher education
Inorder for a student to have higher grades they need to be able to follow instructions and work hard by following the structures and platforms created by Edoofa.
Edoofa makes sure that they put their students in schools that are managed by families or groups with right infrastructure and environment to ensure that children work and achieve their best.
The SOP is a chance for the student to convince any admission board or any school why they are worthy of the admission or scholarship.
