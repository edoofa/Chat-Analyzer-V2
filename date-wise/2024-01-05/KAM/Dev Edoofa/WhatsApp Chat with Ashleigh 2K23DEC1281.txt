28/12/23, 9:37 AM - +263 78 866 7478: Okay noted noted sir 
We can proceed 
I wanted to ask about the  EWYL schedule
Because I'm resuming school on the 8th of January
So I wanted to know if there is a schedule so that I will check when I will be fully free at school and squeeze in time for the program
28/12/23, 9:40 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have taken a note of this as well, Ashleigh. You will soon get to know about your EWYL schedule during the further process.

28/12/23, 9:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
28/12/23, 9:46 AM - +263 78 866 7478: Noted sir 
It's clear
28/12/23, 9:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
28/12/23, 10:02 AM - +263 78 866 7478: A lot of things impressed me 
I liked how my counselor was welcoming and patient with me throughout my application, it really made me feel warm towards the Edoofa program 
I also liked the Earn while you learn program the most because I have  always wanted to be a little independent with my studies at an early age and  I am happy that the program is going to cater for that 
Knowing that many Zimbabweans came that side through Edoofa made me interested and want to be part of the family 
So basically most of the aspects of the program impressed me <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 10:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have known the counselor for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track.

28/12/23, 11:02 AM - +263 78 866 7478: I am usually free in the afternoon when I am at school that is from 3PM to 4PM 
I don't know if an hour will be enough for the sessions 
But our school timetable is going to change since we are starting a new grade.
We might have afternoon lessons but not only daily basis 
So for my sessions whilst I am at school,is it okay if I update you when I'm at school?
But during holidays I will be free around 12 after my last lesson
28/12/23, 11:02 AM - +263 78 866 7478: So we can have the session from 12 to 1 if it's okay?
28/12/23, 11:07 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms and your academic documents with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
28/12/23, 11:12 AM - +263 78 866 7478: Noted sir 
I'm going to my school tomorrow to try and get the recommendation letter from the headmaster 
So I'll keep you updated if I get it before the session because the offices will be a bit busy with parents paying fees for their children for next term
28/12/23, 11:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: I have taken a note of this and completely understand!
28/12/23, 11:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:00 pm for our next session.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
2/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 866 7478: Yes we can start
2/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 866 7478: You’re welcome

2/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 78 866 7478: I am done
2/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
2/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
2/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
2/1/24, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: are you clear, Ashleigh?
2/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 78 866 7478: Yes i am
2/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 78 866 7478: Noted
2/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
2/1/24, 2:58 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Dev Edoofa: have you noted this Ashleigh?
2/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 866 7478: Yes noted sir
2/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
2/1/24, 3:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 78 866 7478: Noted
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
2/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 78 866 7478: I have a lesson starting in a few minutes sir can we proceed tomorrow?
2/1/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Okay Ashleigh, I completely understand.
I am sharing with you 4 videos that you have to watch to complete the first step of the admission cycle.
This will take not more than 30 minutes to watch, so make sure you are completing this task before our next session at 8:30 am tomorrow.
2/1/24, 3:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*
