3/1/24, 9:10 AM - Dev Edoofa: Please let me know if you have taken a note of this.
3/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok
3/1/24, 9:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Coming back to the admission. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/1/24, 9:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes they are clear
3/1/24, 9:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 997 2192: I will fix it tomorrow morning
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: Noted!
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: please let me know if you are clear about these steps?
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes l am following
3/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes l am clear
3/1/24, 9:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/1/24, 9:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes they are clear as well
3/1/24, 9:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yed
3/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
3/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: Diolyne, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
3/1/24, 9:40 AM - +263 78 997 2192: The first video focuses on the qualities of successful students on Edoofa. It is important for students to understand the value of consistency and discipline, both of which are essential for success.
The second video explains the vision of Edoofa and the reason why they exist. Understanding the reason behind a platform can help students find their own vision and align it with the platform.
And the third video is focused on the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa platform. It's always important to know the  institutes that are on Edoofa. Knowing more about the schools and colleges can help students find the right fit for their academic and career goals.
I hope this helps clarify my understanding of these videos. Is there anything else you'd like to know about them?
3/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 78 997 2192: The first video focuses on the qualities of successful students on Edoofa. It is important for students to understand the value of consistency and discipline, both of which are essential for success.

3/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 997 2192: From my understanding, this video emphasizes the importance of taking the time to write a strong and compelling SOP. It also highlights the need to be authentic and genuine in the SOP, as schools want to get to know the real person behind the application. In addition, the video discusses the importance of editing and proofreading the SOP before submitting it.
3/1/24, 9:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Thank you for being sincere during the sessions.
3/1/24, 9:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
3/1/24, 9:57 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes

3. There are many different farming systems, but some common ones include conventional farming, organic.All of these farming systems are used in different parts of the world. Conventional farming is used in most parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Organic farming is also widely used, but it's most popular in Europe and North America. Regenerative farming is still in its early stages, but it's gaining popularity in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The choice of farming system depends on a variety of factors, including the climate, the soil type and availability of resources. The different farming systems have different uses, depending on the context. For example, conventional farming is often used to produce large quantities of food to meet the needs of a growing population. Organic farming is often used to meet the demand for food that is grown without synthetic chemicals. Regenerative 
farming is often used to improve soil health and increase resilience to climate change. 
4.Pesticides are chemicals that are used to control pests;including insects,weeds and fungi.There are many types for example Organophosphates used to control insects and also used in public health to kill mosquitoes.They can pose a risk to humans,they cause nausea,vomiting and diarrrhoea.Glyphosate is effective at killing weeds but it can harm beneficial insects such as bees.Fungicides which are used to control fungi that damages crops but it can cause harm to aquatic life.2,4-D, used to control weeds and can cause damage to liver and kidneys.
5.Okay, there are many other ways in which technology assist farmers examples  include is the use of smart irrigation systems, which use sensors and other technology to optimize water use and to reduce water waste. Another example is the use of autonomous tractors and other machinery, which can reduce labor costs and increase efficiency. There is also the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence to help farmers make more informed decisions about their operations.

4/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Soil fertility is the ability of soil to support plant growth. It's a complex and dynamic property of soil, and it's affected by many factors, including the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil. Some of the things that affect soil fertility include the amount of organic matter, the presence of nutrients, the structure of the soil, and the soil's pH. All of these factors work together to determine how well plants can grow in the soil. 
There are several ways to check soil fertility. One common method is to perform a soil test. A soil test can measure the soil's pH, nutrient levels, organic matter content, and other factors. Another method is to look at the soil's structure and texture, and to observe how well plants are growing in the soil. In addition, farmers and gardeners can keep track of crop yields to get an idea of soil fertility. Finally, there are also some more advanced methods, like using sensors to measure soil moisture and  There are many ways to improve soil fertility. One way is to add organic matter, like compost or manure. This can help improve the soil's structure, increase its nutrient content, and boost its ability to hold water. Another way is to use cover crops, which are plants that are grown to improve the soil. They can add nutrients and organic matter to the soil, and they can also prevent erosion and reduce weed growth. Additionally, farmers and gardeners can rotate their crops to avoid depleting the soil of nutrients.
4/1/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 997 2192: 3. There are many different farming systems, but some common ones include conventional farming,  organic farming, and regenerative farming. Conventional farming is the most common type of farming, and it typically involves the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Organic farming is a method of farming that uses natural, organic materials and avoids the use of synthetic chemicals. Regenerative farming is a relatively new approach that focuses on restoring and improving the health of the soil.
All of these farming systems are used in different parts of the world. Conventional farming is used in most parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Organic farming is also widely used, but it's most popular in Europe and North America. Regenerative farming is still in its early stages, but it's gaining popularity in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The choice of farming system depends on a variety of factors, including the climate, the soil type, and the availability of resources. 
 In Africa, most farming is still done using traditional, subsistence farming methods. This means that farmers rely on their own land and labor to produce food for themselves and their families. However, there is a growing trend towards more commercialized farming systems in some parts of Africa. For example, in South Africa, a large percentage of the country's agricultural production comes from commercial farms that use conventional farming methods. 
The different farming systems have different uses, depending on the context. For example, conventional farming is often used to produce large quantities of food to meet the needs of a growing population. Organic farming is often used to meet the demand for food that is grown without synthetic chemicals. Regenerative farming is often used to improve soil health and increase resilience to climate change. All of these farming systems can have positive and negative impacts on the environment, depending on how they are implemented.Aside from the three types I've already mentioned, there are several other farming systems used around the world. One example is biodynamic farming, which is based on the belief that plants and animals are connected to the cosmos. Another example is permaculture, which is a system of design that uses ecological principles to create self-sustaining ecosystems. There is also agroforestry, which is a method of farming that integrates trees with crops or livestock production.
4/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Pesticides are chemicals that are used to control pests, including insects, weeds, and fungi. They can be used on crops, livestock, and other areas where pests are a problem. There are different types of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. While pesticides can be effective at controlling pests, they can also have negative impacts on human health and the environment.  They can be used to protect crops from pests, to kill insects that carry disease, or to prevent the spread of weeds. Some pesticides are also used to control rodents, birds, or other animals. However, all pesticides have the potential to cause harm if they are used incorrectly. They can contaminate food, water, and soil, and they can also harm humans and animals.  Organophosphates are one of the most commonly used types of pesticides. They are used in agriculture to control insects, and they are also used in public health to kill mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects. Organophosphates are very effective at killing pests, but they also pose a risk to humans and animals. Exposure to organophosphates can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can also cause more serious problems, such as nervous system damage and cancer. One example is glyphosate, which is a widely used herbicide. It is effective at killing weeds, but it can also harm beneficial insects, such as bees. Another example is neonicotinoids, which are a type of insecticide that has been linked to the decline of bee populations. Finally, there are fungicides, which are used to control fungi that can damage crops. Fungicides can contaminate water sources and may also be harmful to aquatic life. Another example is atrazine, which is a herbicide that is commonly used in corn and other crops. Atrazine has been linked to reproductive problems in frogs, and it has also been found in drinking water. Another example is chlorpyrifos, which is a pesticide that is commonly used in agriculture. It has been linked to neurological problems in children, and it has been banned in some countries. Finally, there is 2,4-D, which is a herbicide that is used to control weeds in lawns and other areas. It can cause damage to the liver and kidneys,
4/1/24, 10:31 AM - +263 78 997 2192: 5.Okay, there are many other ways in which technology can assist farmers,  One example is the use of smart irrigation systems, which use sensors and other technology to optimize water use and to reduce water waste. Another example is the use of autonomous tractors and other machinery, which can reduce labor costs and increase efficiency. There is also the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence to help farmers make more informed .There are  other several ways. One example is precision agriculture, which uses sensors and other technologies to monitor crop health and to make more efficient use of resources, such as water and fertilizer. Another example is biotechnology, which involves the use of genetically modified crops that are resistant to pests and diseases. This can reduce the need for pesticides. Finally, there is also the use of drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for tasks such as spraying pesticides. This can reduce the amount of pesticides that are used and can also make the process more efficient.
