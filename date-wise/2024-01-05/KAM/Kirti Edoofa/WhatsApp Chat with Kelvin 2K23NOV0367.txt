With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.

2/1/24, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms it is duly noted with us and we will update them in our records.

2/1/24, 2:05 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
2/1/24, 2:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
2/1/24, 2:08 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
2/1/24, 2:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:17 PM - +27 67 804 4619: I've gone through it
2/1/24, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
2/1/24, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes they are
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
2/1/24, 2:40 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
2/1/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
2/1/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
2/1/24, 2:57 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes

2/1/24, 3:08 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
2/1/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
2/1/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually

2/1/24, 3:16 PM - +27 67 804 4619: This message was deleted
2/1/24, 3:19 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Is Thursday 2pm alright because I currently do not have a lot of internet data.But Tommorow I'll get some data so that I can watch the videos
2/1/24, 3:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27678044619 I completely understand having no data can be an issue, and it is alright. However, Thursday will be a long time, may I know if you will be able to go through the videos by tomorrow 05:00 pm?
2/1/24, 3:22 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay I will try to go through them before 05:00
2/1/24, 3:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 05:00 pm CAT. I hope you will be available. Have a blessed day ahead and do convey my regards to your family as well.
2/1/24, 3:25 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay thanks you
3/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Kelvin,

I hope this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
3/1/24, 4:48 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Good day

Yes we may proceed
3/1/24, 4:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
3/1/24, 4:53 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes I was able
3/1/24, 4:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
3/1/24, 5:05 PM - +27 67 804 4619: The founders explained and emphasized the importance of participation and open-mindedness.They really emphasized on how it made things easier for students under edoofa.

They also touched on other aims of Edoofa like ; making students actually more employable other than providing them with knowledge only.
They also want to teach students how to be independent and responsible for the better future.

Thirdly they explained the processes they go through to check the quality of good schools.

They finally touched on the SOP at the end
3/1/24, 5:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
3/1/24, 5:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
3/1/24, 5:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
3/1/24, 5:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
3/1/24, 5:53 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay for expanding it further
3/1/24, 5:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
3/1/24, 6:00 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
3/1/24, 6:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
3/1/24, 6:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

The term user interface(UI) is defined as the space where interactions between humans and machines—computers— occur.
While the term User experience (UX) refers to the user's journey when interacting with a product or service.

UI and UX  are both crucial elements in the digital world, shaping how people interact with technology. UI focuses on the visual and interactive aspects, such as buttons and layouts on screens , while UX facilitates the overall experience, addressing usability and accessibility. 

In today's digital landscape, seamless UI/UX design is important for creating user-friendly and engaging products, be it websites, apps, or software. A well-designed UI ensures a visually appealing interface, while thoughtful UX design optimizes a user's journey, enhancing satisfaction and function. As technology evolves, the demand for intuitive UI/UX experiences continues to grow, playing a pivotal role in attracting and retaining users in a growing digital environment.

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that divides network communications functions into seven layers.
Sending data over a network has tons of complexities because various hardware and software technologies must work cohesively across geographical and political boundaries to perform their functions.

Here are the following 7 seven layers in detail 

1. *Physical Layer:*  Deals with the physical connection between devices, defining aspects like cables, connectors, and voltage levels.

2.*Data Link Layer:* Responsible for reliable point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication, including error detection and correction. Ethernet is what operates at this layer.

3.*Network Layer:* Focuses on logical addressing and routing of data packets between devices in different networks. WiFi Routers operate at this layer.

4.*Transport Layer:* Ensures reliable data transfer and manages end-to-end communication — for privacy—, incorporating flow control and error correction mechanisms within itself.

5. *Session Layer:* Manages sessions or connections between applications, providing synchronization and dialog control.

6.*Presentation Layer:* Translates data between the application layer and the lower layers, handling data format conversions, encryption, and compression.

7.*Application Layer:* Interacts directly with end-user applications, facilitating network services like file transfers, email, and remote login.

The OSI model guides the  network structure, fostering interoperability between diverse systems.

Compilers and interpreters are both tools used in programming, but they differ in their approaches to executing code.

 A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code or an intermediate code before execution. This results in the creation of a standalone executable file. The compiled code runs independently of the original source code, often providing faster execution as the translation is done beforehand.

 On the other hand, an interpreter processes and executes the source code line by line without creating a separate executable . The output is generated on-the-fly during execution, requiring the interpreter to be present on the system. While interpreters are generally more flexible and allow for easier debugging, compilers optimize performance by translating the entire code in advance. Each approach has its advantages, influencing their suitability for different programming cases.
4/1/24, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
4/1/24, 2:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
4/1/24, 2:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Sc (Computer Science) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
4/1/24, 3:03 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 3:03 PM - +27 67 804 4619: But my letter of recommendation is yet what to come out
4/1/24, 3:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, you can share the letter of recommendation once you receive it.
4/1/24, 3:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
4/1/24, 3:10 PM - +27 67 804 4619: This message was deleted
4/1/24, 3:14 PM - +27 67 804 4619: May I be excused until 4:45 o'clock as I have a few errands to run before the end of the day <This message was edited>
4/1/24, 3:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that @27678044619 surely in that case, may I know if you will be available to connect with us today at 06:00 pm?
4/1/24, 4:44 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 4:44 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Even now I am available
4/1/24, 6:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we can connect now. So may I know if you are ready to start with our discussion?
4/1/24, 6:59 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
4/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
4/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
4/1/24, 7:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
4/1/24, 7:46 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
4/1/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
4/1/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
4/1/24, 8:06 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Correct
4/1/24, 8:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
4/1/24, 8:13 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 8:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
4/1/24, 8:16 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
4/1/24, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
4/1/24, 8:19 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay
4/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
4/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
4/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
4/1/24, 8:26 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay.so this registration fee will be adjusted on the university fees.

Therefore it means we will not pay the $1000 before coming to India?
4/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. This fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
4/1/24, 8:28 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Ohhh okay I understand
4/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
4/1/24, 8:30 PM - +27 67 804 4619: No not for now
4/1/24, 8:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
4/1/24, 8:46 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 8:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
4/1/24, 8:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students.

4/1/24, 8:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
4/1/24, 9:01 PM - +27 67 804 4619: I have reviewed them
4/1/24, 9:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -

*1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, garde 12 and 10 results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
4/1/24, 9:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
4/1/24, 9:07 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay
4/1/24, 9:08 PM - +27 67 804 4619: So when will you send apply at the universities as for now I still await my grade 12 and letter of recommendation?
4/1/24, 9:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27678044619 as we move ahead with our discussion your query regarding this shall be answered once we discuss the benefits in detail.
4/1/24, 9:17 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay
4/1/24, 9:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if the above point is clear to you?
4/1/24, 9:19 PM - +27 67 804 4619: It is
4/1/24, 9:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
4/1/24, 9:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
4/1/24, 9:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
4/1/24, 9:23 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 9:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
4/1/24, 9:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
4/1/24, 9:25 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
4/1/24, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
4/1/24, 9:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
4/1/24, 9:28 PM - +27 67 804 4619: No I've understood
4/1/24, 9:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level/ grade 12results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
4/1/24, 9:32 PM - +27 67 804 4619: May you provide more information
4/1/24, 9:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level/ Grade 12 results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
4/1/24, 9:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
4/1/24, 9:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
4/1/24, 9:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
4/1/24, 9:38 PM - +27 67 804 4619: I understand now
4/1/24, 9:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their grade 12 exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
4/1/24, 9:40 PM - +27 67 804 4619: True
4/1/24, 9:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level/ Grade 12 (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)* <This message was edited>
4/1/24, 9:44 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 9:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
4/1/24, 9:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
4/1/24, 9:48 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 9:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
4/1/24, 9:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
4/1/24, 9:50 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes
4/1/24, 9:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
4/1/24, 9:54 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay
4/1/24, 9:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
4/1/24, 9:56 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Nothing for now
4/1/24, 9:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
4/1/24, 9:58 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Yes!
4/1/24, 9:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
4/1/24, 10:01 PM - +27 67 804 4619: Okay thank you
