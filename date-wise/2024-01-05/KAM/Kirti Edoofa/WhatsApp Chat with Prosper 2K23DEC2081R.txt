My dad is a truck driver who always make sure that his family is well fed, clothed and educated. My mom is a qualified teacher but not yet employed and she also makes sure that we are always happy as a family.

The admiration and respect you have for your parents are truly heartwarming. It's evident that they are not only your greatest inspiration but also your pillars of support. Your father's dedication, ensuring that his family’s needs are met, and your mother’s role as a teacher, reflect their commitment to your family's well-being and happiness.
