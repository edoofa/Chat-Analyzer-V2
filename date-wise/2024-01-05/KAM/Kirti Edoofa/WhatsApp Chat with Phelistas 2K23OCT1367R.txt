Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, what we can do is connect today for our discussion at 06:00 pm CAT. And from tomorrow onwards at 01:00 pm CAT.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
21/12/23, 5:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
21/12/23, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
26/12/23, 6:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Phelistas.

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion, I wanted to reach out and check if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
27/12/23, 4:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Phelistas.

I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
28/12/23, 1:19 PM - +263 77 240 7949: Hie mery Xmas guys
28/12/23, 1:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Phelistas.

I hope this message reaches you in good health. I hope you had a delightful Christmas celebration.  Since we were unable to continue with our discussion, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
28/12/23, 2:14 PM - +263 77 240 7949: Yes please all was fine am connected  now
28/12/23, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, coming back to the payment modes. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
28/12/23, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
28/12/23, 2:58 PM - +263 77 240 7949: You have made it so easy for me  to pay through FBC through Mr Charles that is in Masvingo. May God bless you  now May I have the account Nos
28/12/23, 2:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - +263 77 240 7949: Great mum ,May i have a Xmas present  mum
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I did not understand you well here, could you please help me understand better?
28/12/23, 3:06 PM - +263 77 240 7949: May I have  a Xmas present from India from you
28/12/23, 3:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Oh well, @263772407949, I believe your Christmas present came early to you. It arrived on the 20th of December in the form of your scholarship offer letter. As your admission officer, I consider this present to be the best you've received this year, as it opens doors for your higher education and provides you with an opportunity to pursue a successful career, doesn't it?
28/12/23, 3:47 PM - +263 77 240 7949: It is mum ,I really appreciate  it
28/12/23, 3:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
28/12/23, 4:14 PM - +263 77 240 7949: So how much am to deposit now
28/12/23, 4:15 PM - +263 77 240 7949: Is it not supposed  to be $320,
28/12/23, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772407949 right now what I have shared is the annual cost, so please do not worry about it.
28/12/23, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
28/12/23, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
28/12/23, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
28/12/23, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
28/12/23, 6:31 PM - +263 77 240 7949: Yes this has been said in the previous communications,but thank you greatly for the highlight
28/12/23, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
28/12/23, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
28/12/23, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
28/12/23, 6:40 PM - +263 77 240 7949: As I was comparing with a University in Zimbabwe called MSU-Middle State University  ,Edoofa became a very cheap and affordable institution, great for being with you
28/12/23, 6:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that she will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education while balancing her academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
28/12/23, 6:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 77 240 7949: May I know the amount of money that I have to deposit now as my admission  partly
28/12/23, 6:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you, it is $325 before 3rd January. If you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before January 3rd, 2024.
28/12/23, 6:46 PM - +263 77 240 7949: Thank you greatly
28/12/23, 6:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
