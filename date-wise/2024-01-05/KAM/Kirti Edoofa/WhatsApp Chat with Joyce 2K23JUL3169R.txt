19/12/23, 8:48 AM - You joined using this group's invite link
19/12/23, 12:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce.

I hope this message finds you well. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us so that we can continue with our discussion?
19/12/23, 12:51 PM - +260 97 7632700: Yes good afternoon and how are you today and how is your family
19/12/23, 12:52 PM - +260 97 7632700: Iam . available
19/12/23, 1:16 PM - +260 97 7632700: Will you also explain on registration fee along side with the 1850 <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great and my family is doing good as well. Surely @260977632700 we are going to discuss everything in detail do not worry about it please.
19/12/23, 1:22 PM - +260 97 7632700: Ooh okay
19/12/23, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Joyce will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
19/12/23, 1:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you? <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 1:27 PM - +260 97 7632700: No not clear be precise with vivid examples please
19/12/23, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260977632700 may I know what did you not understand here, maybe you can help me here so that I can help you understand better?
19/12/23, 1:31 PM - +260 97 7632700: Okay is it 1850-1000anx if so where is the 900 coming from
19/12/23, 1:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It was a typing error ma'am if you check the message again I had already updated it right.
19/12/23, 1:35 PM - +260 97 7632700: It's not reflecting
19/12/23, 1:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 1:39 PM - +260 97 7632700: I still have a querry on the first payment  of $350 I paid  at first is it a stand alone or is it part of the fees <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 1:41 PM - +260 97 7632700: Clear thanks
19/12/23, 1:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, which you have already paid, and the $1000 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee that is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
19/12/23, 1:49 PM - +260 97 7632700: In short they are treated differently
19/12/23, 1:50 PM - +260 97 7632700: Not to subtracted from the tuition fees
19/12/23, 2:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, the $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
19/12/23, 2:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Joyce is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
19/12/23, 2:10 PM - +260 97 7632700: Okay
19/12/23, 2:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
19/12/23, 2:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
19/12/23, 2:13 PM - +260 97 7632700: I do
19/12/23, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and this amount can be paid in two installments of $425 and $425, spaced 6 months apart.

The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
19/12/23, 2:17 PM - +260 97 7632700: Teyea
19/12/23, 2:17 PM - +260 97 7632700: ..clear and sounds good
19/12/23, 2:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 29th, 2023*.
19/12/23, 2:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/12/23, 2:26 PM - +260 97 7632700: Yes please will appreciate
19/12/23, 2:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *January 29th, 2024, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/12/23, 2:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Joyce's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/12/23, 2:32 PM - +260 97 7632700: Yes clear,
19/12/23, 2:32 PM - +260 97 7632700: Will the university email me Joyce's offer letter or this same one you sent <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 3:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand what you are trying to say here. However, let me help you understand better. The university is our partnered university and sometimes the university gets occupied hence they share the offer letter with us to share with you, meaning the letter you have received is the official offer letter. So you do not have to worry about it.
19/12/23, 3:41 PM - +260 97 7632700: Okay
19/12/23, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account
19/12/23, 3:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
19/12/23, 5:00 PM - +260 97 7632700: I will let you know first I consult
19/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, you can. Let me just reshare the account details with you once if needed.

I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
20/12/23, 2:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Joyce,

26/12/23, 1:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I did not understand your question well here, could you please help me understand your question better?
4/1/24, 10:22 AM - +260 771370508: Morning miss kirti
4/1/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce. 

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful New Year's. May I know if you have any thoughts of concerns to share with us?
4/1/24, 12:58 PM - +260 771370508: Am ok ma'am thanks. I was asking is it possible for me to change my course
4/1/24, 2:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know why do you wish to change your course all of a sudden?
4/1/24, 2:24 PM - +260 771370508: Because ma'am I feel am more interested in things involving commerce and accounting rather than sciences
4/1/24, 3:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what particular reasons made you think about this sudden change because accounting and science are two different streams?
4/1/24, 7:25 PM - +260 771370508: I used to take accounts and commerce, I was good in these subjects because I enjoyed them. I have been thinking about this for a while now and I just decided that I would rather do something I enjoy and like for the rest of my life than living to regret the decision
4/1/24, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, it is good to know that you are considering what you enjoy, however, may I know if your parents support you in the same, also could you please let me know about your subject combination for Grade 12?
4/1/24, 8:22 PM - +260 771370508: I am sure my mum will support me
4/1/24, 8:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed I am sure about that, could you please let me know about your subject combination for Grade 12?
4/1/24, 8:44 PM - +260 771370508: Maybe my mum can do that I really don't know how to do
4/1/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260771370508 I guess you did not understood my question here, what I am asking you to share with us the name of the subjects that you had in your grade 12.
4/1/24, 8:51 PM - +260 771370508: Mathematics, English, physics, chemistry, biology, principles of accounts, commerce civic education and religious education
4/1/24, 9:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Yes, please it is certainly possible since you have the subjects you will be able to change your course, in MVN University, however, for now, it will not be possible since you have already received the offer letter and if we ask the university to change the course now, they would get a negative impression that the student is not serious enough for the scholarship.
4/1/24, 9:02 PM - +260 771370508: Oh that's really bad
4/1/24, 9:04 PM - +260 771370508: So that's it I can't do anything else
4/1/24, 9:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @260771370508 I mentioned you could change the course since you have the subjects needed, you can change the course even after you arrive in India.
4/1/24, 9:14 PM - +260 771370508: Oh OK ma'am I now understand
4/1/24, 9:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, have a blessed evening ahead, and do convey my regards to your family as well
4/1/24, 9:26 PM - +260 771370508: Thank you ma'am have a good night
