29/12/23, 7:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27623108365 It is good to know that. May I know if your statement of entry for A- level or the exam date sheet for grade 12?
29/12/23, 7:46 PM - +27 62 310 8365: I'm sorry sir , I lost it when I was still at school
29/12/23, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, @27623108365 I would suggest you please connect with your school teacher and tell them the reason why you need a letter of recommendation. 

Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
29/12/23, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
29/12/23, 7:56 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Okay
29/12/23, 7:59 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Right now schools are closed , they will open on 9th of January 2024
29/12/23, 8:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, you can share the letter with me on the 9th of January 2024.
29/12/23, 8:07 PM - +27 62 310 8365: I will try my best
29/12/23, 8:11 PM - +27 62 310 8365: Results for 2022 candidates were released on 13th of January 2023 ,so I'm   thinking they will be out real soon
29/12/23, 8:11 PM - +263 77 586 0274: Sir let me answer honestly on that. It is not easy to get it exactly on the opening day. Some teachers will not be there at school on the opening day. Usually first week of January school authorities are very busy with the form ones.
Since he is not here in Zimbabwe I will go there myself to meet the acting head
29/12/23, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @27623108365 Thank you for letting me know that, in that case. Let us reconnect on the 2nd of January 2024, that is Tuesday. As we will not be available tomorrow due to the weekend, followed by the New year. I hope you will be available.
