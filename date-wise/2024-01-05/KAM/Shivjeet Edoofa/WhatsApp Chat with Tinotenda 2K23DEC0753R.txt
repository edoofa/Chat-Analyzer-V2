4/1/24, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
4/1/24, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
4/1/24, 6:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
4/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 78 563 0900: When we open schools I will make sure to get it. We will be opening on the 9th of January
4/1/24, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In that case let us wait for the same.
4/1/24, 8:59 PM - +263 78 563 0900: Okay thank you
4/1/24, 9:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome.
