I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping to get a response from your end over the past couple of days and it seems that all my efforts are in vain. I would like to let you know that most of your peers have completed or started the admission process. Hence I am reaching out you again and wanted to inquire about proceeding with your session. So, if you are getting my message please let me know so that we can proceed with the session and commence with the journey so that we don't end up losing out on the opportunities that lies ahead.
