27/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 71 590 5125: Greetings Mr Shivjeet and all the Edoofa Program leadership. Hope you're doing great. 
It was a good experience and I enjoyed being part of the Edoofa family. On a sad note I am no longer able to continue with my programme reason being I am joining my cousin sister in Dubai. She has arranged something for me so l will be living Zim next year in January. It was nice interacting with you I have learnt a lot, you are such lovely people. Me and my family have enjoyed every session and all the magazines from the head of Edoofa Programme they were motivational, eye opening and they gave a wider picture of what i should be in life. Pass my regards to all those who were with me in this journey of becoming a proud Edoofian as we were all looking forward to that. May you continue with the good caring lovely spirit even to the new Edoofians to come. Have a lovely day. Thank you
