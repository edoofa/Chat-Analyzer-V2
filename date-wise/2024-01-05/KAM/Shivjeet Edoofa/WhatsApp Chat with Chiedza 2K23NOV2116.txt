I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of Spirits. 

While I was organizing my day for today, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of $150 for the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee today. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction and make the payment of your fee today? <This message was edited>

I hope you are doing a fine evening today. I would like to let you know that I was not able to further connect with you recently as I was occupied with multiple calls with the university. To make up for this let us connect tomorrow at 6:00 PM for further process for our session.
