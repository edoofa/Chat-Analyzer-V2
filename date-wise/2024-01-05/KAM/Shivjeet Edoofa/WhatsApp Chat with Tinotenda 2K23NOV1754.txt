4/1/24, 7:51 PM - +263 77 742 7613: Yesterday I went to Tinotenda's  wanted to do payment plan for her fees.I discussed with the administration block about the scholarship enrollment for Tinotenda and briefed them were we are now .They were aware about Edoofa scholarship but  they had some questions about the program of Earn While you learn program.They figured out that some of their past students who came there ,they didn't  go through that process .They said when their student got a scholarship, the school (organizing staff )with the board of Edoofa  create a group.They also highlighted that one of their head boy  who was in A level got a scholarship last year and the school was aware of that  but for Tinotenda it was a new scenario.They asked me to come back on Tuesday and meet the Principal .
Sorry for the inconveniences are you aware of Tinotenda's school.
2.Which team of the Edoofa visited the school ,if  you can give me their names  maybe it will be much of help .
4/1/24, 9:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the update and for visiting Tinotenda's school on behalf of the Edoofa scholarship. I appreciate your effort in clarifying matters with the administration.

Regarding the Earn While You Learn program, it's an integral part of our scholarship initiative, providing students with practical experiences alongside their studies. Regarding the teams please bear with me for a while as I share the information tomorrow.
