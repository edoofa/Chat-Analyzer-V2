21/12/23, 6:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tanaka!

It has been a quite few days now. I wanted to reach out to you about your current situation. May I know if the rituals have been completed?
29/12/23, 2:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanaka

I hope you are doing well and I find you in the best of Spirits. I was hoping to get a response from your end the past couple of days so that we can reconnect with each other and understand how you as a family have been. 

While I was organizing my day today, I went through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of $150 for the remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee before 31st December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction and make the payment of your fee?

4/1/24, 9:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing a fine evening today. I would like to let you know that I was not able to further connect with you recently as I was occupied with multiple calls with the university. To make up for this let us connect tomorrow at 6:00 PM for further process for our session.
