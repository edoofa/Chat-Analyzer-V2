As per our recent conversation, your fees were extended till the 30th of Nov. meaning that the second payment falls after a month that is 30th Dec. Hence I would like to let you know that since we are approaching the month's end may I know if you might be able to share an update with me regarding the payment. I will be having a meeting with the university officials tomorrow and will be discussing the same with them. Hence, may I know if you might be able to share an update about the second payment?
