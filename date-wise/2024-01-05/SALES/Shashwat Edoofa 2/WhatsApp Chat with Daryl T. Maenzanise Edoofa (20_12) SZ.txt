By learning these things you could bring them to your home country and hopefully make it better in some way

This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship.

29/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 490 6650: I took a gap year as there was a Covid lockdown in Zimbabwe during the time
29/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for bringing that to my attention, Daryl. I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
