04/01/24, 3:10 pm - +260 765473108: I love both nature and technology, but of late, technology has overthrown the balance more than ever in history due to its advancement and has taken a toll on the environment. Hence, to me, it seems like there is a war between these two elements. And so I want to change things and create a world where there is unity and balance between the two. To equalise advancement on both ends.
04/01/24, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tabo. As your *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide you towards a path that caters to your aspirations.

04/01/24, 3:51 pm - +260 765473108: Thank you
04/01/24, 3:53 pm - +260 765473108: Is there a course where I can research, design, and build systems that can effectively develop technology and nature at the same time?
04/01/24, 4:36 pm - +260 97 7800145: This message was deleted
04/01/24, 5:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
04/01/24, 5:54 pm - +260 765473108: Electrical engineering captivates me because technology is really amazing, and I feel it could be among the best things man was allowed to create. It has been used to help so many people in various aspects, i.e.,physically, mentally, and even emotionally. So I want to be able to do the same. But not just people, for mother nature as well. I feel it would be good to aim at developing and combining technology and nature, seeing as it is on this very earth that technology is being developed that is destroying it.
04/01/24, 5:59 pm - +260 765473108: I am drawn towards both nature and technology, but recently, it has appeared that technology advancement isn't always being targeted at helping the environment. I feel that there must be a balance between the two since the very same technology is made on our natural planet
04/01/24, 6:10 pm - +260 765473108: For years, I had found joy in tearing devices apart just to look at how the tiny components interacted and functioned. A few years later, I found out about the youngest female activist, whose name is Greta Thunberg. The information she let out enlightened me to the issues our world is facing. This prompted me to take a good look around my own country to notice just how bad we are hurting the planet that only did good for us. Through this time, I pondered on whether I could combine the two because it was then that I realised what I wanted to be able to do in the future

04/01/24, 9:54 pm - +260 765473108: Thank you
