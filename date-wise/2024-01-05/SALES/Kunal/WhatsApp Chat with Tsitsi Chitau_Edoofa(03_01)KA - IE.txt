03/01/24, 11:03 am - Kunal: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Kelvin who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
03/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 71 690 7996: Yes he did
03/01/24, 11:30 am - Kunal: Can you tell me how much was the scholarship parameter he mentioned?
03/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 71 690 7996: The scholarship parameter is fully funded
03/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 71 690 7996: Thus 100 %
03/01/24, 12:10 pm - Kunal: *International Student Admission Eligibility Check:*

a) Nature of the Scholarship: Partial Scholarship or Fully Funded
Ans:

b) Cost of Education after the Edoofa scholarship: $1500-$3000 or $6000-$8000
Ans:

c) What, in your understanding, is the purpose of the EWYL Program? (Answer in 30-50 words)
Ans:

d) Why do you believe you should be accepted into the Edoofa Program? (Answer in 50-100 words)
Ans:

e) Are your parents aware of the details shared above? If yes, will your parents/guardians be part of the admissions process?
Ans:
03/01/24, 12:10 pm - Kunal: May I know if these questions were asked?
03/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 71 690 7996: Yes they were asked
03/01/24, 12:13 pm - Kunal: Please share your response for these questions
03/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 690 7996: a) fully funded 
b) $2000-$3000

c) PURPOSE OF Earn While You Learn 

The purpose of earn while you learn is that it reduces financial costs for your guardian , students might have ideas but because of scarcity ,earn while you learn will then provide all the financials and the students will get the chance to stand for their projects 
Earn while you learn gives students a room to advance their level of education ,it reduces chances of students borrowing money from the parent 
To my view I think thus the purpose of EARN WHILE YOU LEARN 


d) The reason why I should be accepted in the Edoofa program is that it gives me room to have more advanced knowledge than here 
I want to start up some projects that can benefit the majority of the edoofians and nationally 
In addition, I want to make my education more financially accessible ,the Edoofa program gives me room to expand my ideas so I can expose them to the world and make it a better environment to live .
I also get to link up with different people learning their home country language and many more .
I want to fullfill my purpose for life in India under the Edoofa program 

Above are some of the reasons I should be accepted in the Edoofa program 

e) Yes ,they can be part of the admissions process 
f) 9am - 12pm
03/01/24, 12:35 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing, Tsitsi
03/01/24, 12:36 pm - Kunal: It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me:

I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
04/01/24, 4:34 pm - +263 71 690 7996: Yes I am confident in archieving all my subjects
04/01/24, 4:35 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects and passion, you are eligible for

 *Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering*

Shall I explain the course?
04/01/24, 4:36 pm - +263 71 690 7996: Yes u can explain I will greatly appreciate it
04/01/24, 4:37 pm - Kunal: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
