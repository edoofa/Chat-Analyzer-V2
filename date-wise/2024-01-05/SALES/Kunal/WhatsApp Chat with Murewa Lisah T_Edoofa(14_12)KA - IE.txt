19/12/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
19/12/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about her achieving it
19/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Yes she obtained 12 points on hre A-level passes so lam confident about her
19/12/23, 4:02 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Based on my evaluation, considering her subjects and passion for International relations, you are eligible for

*Bachelor of Arts in Political Science*

Shall I explain the course in depth?
19/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Yes you can sir
19/12/23, 4:04 pm - Kunal: *Bachelor of Arts in Political Science* is a 3-year undergraduate program in Arts and Social Science

BA Political Science degree holders, usually, find employment in a variety of sector like Public Service, Media, Education, Social Service, Publishing, Politics etc.
Politics has been one of the sustaining features of governance across civilization. A Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science, apart from dealing with Political theories, also teaches about various systems of governance, economics, sociology, international relations, global politics, psychology etc.

The course gives an idea about how a nation runs and teaches how to interpret and analyze political systems. This course is ideal for students who have an interest in learning the mechanisms of the administrative aspects of a country. The course not just deals with modern political scenarios but also encompasses the history of political development, various political revolutions across the world, thus helping a student learn the Political practices of countries around the world.

After a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science, a student has multiple academic options available in India. A student vying for higher studies can opt for an MA in Political Science which is a Master’s degree in Political Science. A student can also opt for an MA in International Relations.

Other than the traditional MA options, there is the option to pursue studies in Law. Students who wish to study law after graduation in political science have the option of 3 year LLB course which is offered to students after graduation in any stream.

The option to do an MBA is also open for students after BA in Political Science. In MBA too, there are multiple options like MBA in HRM, MBA in Marketing etc.

*Career Prospects*

The students have a lot of BA Political Science job opportunities once they complete this course. Some of the major job profiles are:

*Public Administrator*    
As a Public Administrator, BA Political Science graduates can utilize their knowledge to inform policy decisions and administer those decisions effectively.

*Academician*    
Those who choose to pursue further education can, in turn, become lecturers and professors.

*Archivist*    
A political archivist is responsible for assessing, collecting, processing, organizing, maintaining and preserving important records which possess long term value.

*Correspondent*    
A political correspondent is responsible for relaying important political events primarily for news channels.

*Political Content Writer*    
A Political content writer’s job is to write about various contemporary and historical political issues majorly for online media outlets for news and information.

*Consultant*    
A political consultant is a professional who helps an organization make politically informed choices. Their knowledge about political philosophy comes in handy in such roles.

*Manager*    
BA in Political Science helps to understand the broad administrative system in India, thus making them the right fit for managerial positions.

*Subject Matter Expert*    
Nowadays many IT and knowledge processing companies require subject matter experts for different subjects.

*PR Executive*    
Public Relations is also a good option as exposure to political practices also acquaints one with culture and social systems of a place and hence making them ideal for a role as Public Relations executive. <This message was edited>

Let us be grateful for this new day of our lives.

20/12/23, 10:29 am - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
20/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 266 4290: Sure she will learn alot.lam not going to afford without any schoolar ship
20/12/23, 10:56 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/12/23, 10:56 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 266 4290: Yes for this 1 it is better
20/12/23, 11:05 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
20/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 266 4290: So l choose this one 2000-3000 per semester.lam happy to hear that it can provides work to the students to reduceng their fees
20/12/23, 11:32 am - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/12/23, 11:32 am - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/12/23, 11:32 am - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

20/12/23, 11:32 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 11:32 am - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
20/12/23, 11:32 am - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
20/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 266 4290: It will benefiting a lot because she can pay her on fees it is an advantage to us as parents.lam so happy to hear that
20/12/23, 12:12 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
20/12/23, 12:46 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
20/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Yes
20/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
20/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
20/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
20/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
20/12/23, 12:52 pm - Kunal changed the group name from "Murewa Lisah T_Edoofa(14/12)KA" to "Murewa Lisah T_Edoofa(14/12)KA - IE"
20/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 266 4290: No3
20/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 266 4290: but u can also advise us the one which is good.
20/12/23, 1:08 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.
20/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Yes sir

20/12/23, 1:12 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Lisah with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
20/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Us as parents
20/12/23, 1:14 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
20/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Iam so so excited
20/12/23, 1:21 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make her career advance at even a greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
20/12/23, 1:21 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
20/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Ok thank you for that what else did they want.whom is going to recommend her
20/12/23, 1:28 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
20/12/23, 1:28 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
20/12/23, 1:28 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Sure lam happy to hear that thus why we choose Edoofa for our girl
20/12/23, 1:36 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
20/12/23, 1:36 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
20/12/23, 1:36 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
20/12/23, 1:36 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Ok thank you l understand that
20/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: I am expecting to hear from you
20/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Iam coming lam just going through this cycle
20/12/23, 2:06 pm - Kunal: Alright please
20/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Stage 1-5 if lam not mistake
20/12/23, 2:08 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
20/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Yes Yes
20/12/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
20/12/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
20/12/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
20/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Yes it is clear
20/12/23, 2:30 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
20/12/23, 2:30 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

21/12/23, 11:47 am - Kunal: Please note that we don't have an office in Zimbabwe since it would be challenging to set up an office in the 29+ countries from which we receive applications. The nearest office to you would be in Kitwe, Zambia. If you have known people in Zambia, I can guide you to visit our office. We have visits to Zimbabwe every year to prepare our Edoofians for their intake

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will he/she be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
21/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 266 4290: 1.international relations
2.lndia
3.2000-3000

5.yes
21/12/23, 12:51 pm - Kunal: The name of the course is Bachelor of Arts in Political Science
21/12/23, 12:52 pm - Kunal: Can you check and correct the 3rd and 4th questions

21/12/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 1:11 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 1:11 pm - Kunal: Dear parents @263772664290 , Before proceeding further, we would like to ensure that you are fully aligned and supportive of the career path of your child. Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?* Your acknowledgement is expected at the earliest and is mandatory to proceed. Do not hesitate to share if you have any challenges.

*Please share your acknowledgement using voice notes*
21/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 266 4290: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: Thank you for the acknowledgement, dear parent!
It has been duly noted and we appreciate your support for your child's career
21/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: As you know, A level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out.
21/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: *So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Lisah?*
21/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Yes
21/12/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: Mr Tsaurai, due to the rush of applicants I am yet to give a slot to you.
I have requested a slot for you and once I get the confirmation, I will let you know
21/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 266 4290: Thank you
22/12/23, 10:44 am - Kunal: This message was deleted
22/12/23, 1:45 pm - Kunal: Greetings, Mr Tsaurai
