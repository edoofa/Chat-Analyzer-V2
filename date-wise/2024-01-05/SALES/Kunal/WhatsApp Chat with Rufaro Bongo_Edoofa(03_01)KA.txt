*“If you believe it’ll work out, you’ll see opportunities. If you don’t believe it’ll work out, you’ll see obstacles.” ―Wayne Dyer*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
04/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 78 327 7905: Yes sir
04/01/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
04/01/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: Please address this
04/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 327 7905: 1. The profession I admire the most is being a neurosurgeon, and i have approached my final year in high school. Unfortunately,  in Zimbabwe,  doctors are not paid enough. Furthermore,  the medicine course taught in Zimbabwe is below par compared to other countries. Therefore, those who do medicine in Zimbabwe don't stand a chance in the global job market.  As you may have known or heard,  Zimbabwe's economic structure is in shambles . My hope is to study abroad, which leads me to another reason. My family's financial status is unable to afford me studying abroad. Understanding this made me opt for scholarship opportunities.  India is renowned for producing and having the best doctors in the world. A prime example is Dr. Sandeep Vaishya , a prominent neurosurgeon currently working in Fotis Memorial Research Institute.  
2. From the program,  so far, I have understood that this is a huge opportunity to help me pursue my career. To add on, I have come to realize that this is a legit scholarship program, unlike other fake programs .
04/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 327 7905: Any questions?
04/01/24, 11:22 am - Kunal: It's evident that you hold a deep passion for becoming a neurosurgeon, a noble and challenging profession. Your decision to seek education abroad aligns with the pursuit of excellence and exposure to global standards in the medical field.

04/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 78 327 7905: Thank you  very much , Mr Kunal. I look forward to further proceedings.
04/01/24, 11:54 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
Alright so, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

*1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination*
*2. The course you would like to study and why*
*3. What do your parents do (their profession)*
*4. What is your parent’s highest education level?*
*5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?*
*6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far*
*7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad*
*8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $?*
04/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 327 7905: I am in U6 doing Mathematics, Biology,  Physics and Chemistry. I wish to study medicine as it is essential to me being a surgeon . All the more, I want to be able to save lives and be a wall between a patient's life and death. Zimbabwe has poor medical standards, and as a result,  the death rates in our country are high. The plan is to become a renowned surgeon and open up multiple public hospitals in, not only Zimbabwe but Africa as a whole.
My father is a Professional Disaster Risk Management practitioner and my mother,  a GIS specialist. 
My father's highest qualification is Doctorate in the field mentioned above, and my mother has a degree . I am blessed with 3 brothers( 2 older,  1 younger). The 2 older brothers recently finished their A Level and are waiting to proceed to tertiary education.  My young brother is currently in Form 3 . My father has been the one financially supporting my education this far.  My father is supposed to support , financially,  my tertiary education abroad, but , unfortunately,  he will not be able to afford international fees, hence why I am applying for a fully funded scholarship. Originally,  my school fee was $1300 , however, due to my excellent performance in the IGCSE level, the school awarded me a discount of $800. 

In my free time, I love to play football . I am also well oriented in chess and athletics. On some occasions,  I find myself relaxed by taking evenings strolls around my neighborhood . I often  play video games after a long and intense study session.
I am blessed with determination and discipline, extraordinary virtues craved by many individuals of my age . My mother always says that I'm someone who is well versed in handling pressure. <This message was edited>

Shall we proceed?
04/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 327 7905: Good afternoon.  I am unable to proceed further with the session . Schools are opening tomorrow, and it's imperative that I finish preparing for the school term . I have a proposal. Is it possible that we derive a flexible timetable  as I will not always be available once the school term starts?
04/01/24, 3:32 pm - Kunal: May I know at what time you will be available?
04/01/24, 8:44 pm - +263 78 327 7905: Pardon me, it seems like I didn't quite explain myself.  Allow me to elaborate.
I am going to school tomorrow, and I won't be able to proceed further with the sessions until I come back from school.  Perhaps we  could schedule the session tomorrow morning ( around 11 a.m.) . I apologize for any inconvenience caused by this.
