Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
04/01/24, 12:15 pm - +27 61 220 8989: I'm confident enough to be one of the achiever because, I have  two A-level passes.
04/01/24, 12:24 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
04/01/24, 12:24 pm - Kunal: Since you are interested in pursuing a course and career in Pharmacy, why did you opt for a commercial subject combination?
04/01/24, 12:39 pm - +27 61 220 8989: The school were l learnt , there were no science labs. That's why I chose commercial subjects.
04/01/24, 12:52 pm - Kunal: Alright, let me tell you that since you do not having a science combination, you are not eligible for Pharmacy
At the same time, may I know if you have any alternate career aspirations?
04/01/24, 1:04 pm - +27 61 220 8989: A career in engineering would be good.
04/01/24, 1:04 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

04/01/24, 5:09 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
