I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 651 3059: Yes, I am
12/12/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
So, may I know with your interest in Medical field, why didn't you opt Physics at A level?
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 651 3059: Because in biology I could learn more about the human body rather than in physics. I also like reading so, biology kept a balance on my combination. Instead of just learning applications, reading and understanding was also important to me
12/12/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: Alright Zanele

13/12/23, 1:14 pm - Kunal: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.

14/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 651 3059: I'm doing well and you?
14/12/23, 12:22 pm - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
14/12/23, 12:22 pm - Kunal: Have you gone through these courses?
14/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 651 3059: Yes. I have. Thank you for your offer but I think I'll just settle for a local school that offers medicine, without physics.
14/12/23, 12:52 pm - Kunal: Zanele, have you considered comparing the career opportunities available to you after obtaining a degree in your home country with those offered by prestigious universities in India?
14/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 651 3059: Yes. I have.
Which is why I've come to this decision. For me, it's not just about the money but doing something that I love. Thank you once again
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: I understand, Zanele
May I know if you are aware about the cost of education while studying in Zimbabwe?
14/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 651 3059: Maximum fees when studying medicine is $800 per semester
14/12/23, 2:29 pm - Kunal: Alright
So may I know the total amount that a student will be spending per annum including the basic necessities such as food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc
14/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 651 3059: Laundry and library are for fees
Campus WiFi is also for free. Food might cost up to around 200-300 per annum if one is not staying on campus
14/12/23, 3:11 pm - Kunal: I see the student is spending more than 2200 USD while studying in Zimbabwe, now through the Edoofa program the cost is much lower and there are specific courses where a child can even receive a higher quantum of scholarship.
14/12/23, 3:11 pm - Kunal: Let me also tell you that our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1200-$1500 per annum with nearly 20% or more hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program!
