26/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 856 6657: The main push factor which made me have confidence  to apply  for the Edoofa Scholarship is that India is the world's oldest and most prestigious universities so it was my desire to study in India .Moreso Studying abroad can make myself be equipped with different skills and technology so in  short I can say  I am greedy with development and skills all over the world so as to be the greater than what I am .. Moving on in our country the are little opportunities of getting Scholarship and poor education as well . Moreso l like rich and diverse culture. Lastly  it is because I am underprivileged girl so I need help on my education so as yo reach my dreams
26/12/23, 2:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing about this, and also I can see you are well-motivated. Please let me add more information to it.
26/12/23, 2:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

26/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 856 6657: Secondly I chose  Business Administration as  the  program  I would like to do because it deals with  branches like Accounting , finance,  marketing and Human Resource management   . Accounting department deals with analysis and interpretation of financial information.  It improves efficiency  . Finance deals with the  management of money and other assets .marketing deals with satisfaction of human needs and wants ..

 I  wrote it On covid 19 lock down so we were not going to school and our school lacked advanced technology of doing online lessons
02/01/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, Please share the subject combination of A level as well.
02/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 77 856 6657: Accounting  Business studies and Economics
02/01/24, 3:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

02/01/24, 4:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
