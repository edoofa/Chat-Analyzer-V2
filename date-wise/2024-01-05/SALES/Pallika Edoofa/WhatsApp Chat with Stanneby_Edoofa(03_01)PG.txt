03/01/24, 7:29 pm - +263 77 404 3070: I am Zviito Kanengoni, the mother of Stanneby Maunga. For living, l am a self employed(vendor). I finished O level and did not proceed due to lack of financial support. So as a parent, l did not want my son to end at a level l ended.

04/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 78 993 4091: What I understand about the program is that they want students to be highly educated and help low previlaged countries attain higher education by offering them scholarships. Edoofa is linked with best universities which makes students get quality education. It also offer industry oriented training so that student will not only know theory. Only to explain a few
