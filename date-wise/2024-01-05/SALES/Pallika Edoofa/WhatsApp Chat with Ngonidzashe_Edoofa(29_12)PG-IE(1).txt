So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
29/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 622 4723: Yes
29/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/12/23, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?* <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 622 4723: Yes
29/12/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
29/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 622 4723: No sir
29/12/23, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright,  Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

29/12/23, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
29/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 622 4723: Yes . The EWYL is good for students by reducing costs which will also reduce financial stress from students
29/12/23, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
29/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 622 4723: Okay
29/12/23, 3:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
29/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 622 4723: Higher Education System Concierge and Earn While You Learn
29/12/23, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on Higher Education System Concierge and Earn While You Learn

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

29/12/23, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 622 4723: My Family
29/12/23, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/12/23, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 622 4723: They're happy
02/01/24, 9:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
02/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 78 622 4723: Yes sir
02/01/24, 9:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
02/01/24, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ngonidzashe, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
02/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 622 4723: I'm doing just fine sir ..how about you?
02/01/24, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
02/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 622 4723: Yes that's it
02/01/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
02/01/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
02/01/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
02/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 622 4723: Yes I understand
02/01/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid.
02/01/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/01/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/01/24, 10:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
02/01/24, 10:01 am - +263 78 622 4723: Okay okay..I understand
02/01/24, 10:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 622 4723: Stage 01
02/01/24, 10:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
02/01/24, 10:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
02/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 622 4723: Yes
02/01/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
02/01/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
02/01/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
02/01/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
02/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 78 622 4723: Yes it is clear
02/01/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

The vision of the program in making Education affordable and also reaching out to make its students employable and making employment ready for them it sounds good and it shows that it also concerned about the future of their students so they strive out planning that on their behalf. And also they liked the aspect of Earn While You Learn program, which also makes the program affordable also by reducing costs to both  the
student and family. Also by studying courses in India it is very good because they have quality,  teachers and  lecturers this helps students to gain more knowledge on both theoratical and practical skills hence valuing my career after studying in India.

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.
03/01/24, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: 5.  *Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While You Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together.
03/01/24, 2:35 pm - +263 78 622 4723: Okay
03/01/24, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
03/01/24, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Dear parents @263733516229 @263737289159 , Before proceeding further, we would like to ensure that you are fully aligned and supportive of the career path of your child. Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?* Your acknowledgement is expected at the earliest and is mandatory to proceed. Do not hesitate to share if you have any challenges.

*Please share your acknowledgement using voice notes*
03/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 78 622 4723: Okay
03/01/24, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know when will your parents manage to reply?
03/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 622 4723: Tomorrow
03/01/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright! I will be waiting!
03/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 622 4723: Okay sir
03/01/24, 8:36 pm - +263 73 351 6229: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 8:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Dear Parent, If we begin the eligibility check stage of your child today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the next week of January. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
04/01/24, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
How are you doing today?
04/01/24, 4:59 pm - +263 78 622 4723: We are doing just fine, how about you?
04/01/24, 5:02 pm - +263 73 351 6229: am bit tied up financially this Jan
how about when A level results are out,maybe early Feb
04/01/24, 8:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That would be a long timeframe, Please note that the intake for 2024 is already open and students who completed form 6 and they are reserving their seats for the same if qualified for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. The major reason for opening the Seat Reservation opportunity for Zimbabwean students is that they receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations were declared last year itself, Malawians received their MSCE results in September, Zambians received the results last year when compared to Zimsec A level results(February 2024), and they are declared much earlier and the students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurricular, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity. So we already have 800+ Zimbabwean student who have qualified for the next intake. <This message was edited>
