29/12/23, 10:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alice, I understand that but to pursue a degree you will need to have A level results.

29/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 862 4135: So when l get the diploma.l would be able to get a degree
29/12/23, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alice, Obtaining a diploma is a significant accomplishment, but it doesn't automatically grant a degree. To earn a degree, you typically need to enroll in a degree program at a college or university and fulfill specific academic requirements.

29/12/23, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alice, As you mentioned that it is your desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because you need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with great marks to be eligible for Nursing.
29/12/23, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, May I know your alternate career aspirations.
29/12/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 862 4135: No l didn't have

29/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 862 4135: Hello
29/12/23, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alice, Kindly excuse for the delay as I have shared your results for evaluation and I am waiting for  the response
29/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 862 4135: Oky oky no problem

29/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 862 4135: If they response please inform me
29/12/23, 12:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: With your educational background limited to O levels, opting for a diploma course is a suitable choice. While pursuing nursing requires NEET Exam and A level results, which might not be feasible, I want to encourage you to follow your passion.
