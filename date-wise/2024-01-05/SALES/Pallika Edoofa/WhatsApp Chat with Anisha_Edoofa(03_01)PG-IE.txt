03/01/24, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Anisha, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
03/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 249 8465: I think they will just let me know the amount
03/01/24, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Anisha, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
