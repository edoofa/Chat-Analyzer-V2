03/01/24, 2:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Once you qualify for the program and complete your enrollment, the admission and EWYL (Earn While You Learn) procedure will commence immediately. Through this, you will have the opportunity to earn scholarship credits ranging from 50 to 100 dollars per month. These credits can significantly contribute to reducing your tuition fees and assist in self-financing your higher education.
03/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 782 2373: Oh okay thank you l understood
03/01/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
03/01/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 782 2373: Yes

04/01/24, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these.
04/01/24, 11:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
04/01/24, 11:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
04/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 782 2373: No l haven't applied university abroad..l only qualified the Edoofa scholarships
04/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 782 2373: I will work hard to get maximum points this year
04/01/24, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!

04/01/24, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 9:16 pm - +263 77 782 2373: I have understood
