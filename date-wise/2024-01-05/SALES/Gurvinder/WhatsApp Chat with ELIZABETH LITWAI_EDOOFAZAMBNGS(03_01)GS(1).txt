I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
03/01/24, 10:36 am - +260 97 1815514: It's a program that offers help to people by offering them scholarships in order for them to further their studies and be able to undertake the career pathway they desire
03/01/24, 10:52 am - +260 97 1815514: Good morning you sir
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
03/01/24, 12:50 pm - +260 97 1815514: Yes so that it can be easy for them to be able to support my family because of the scholarship i have and so that they can spend less money on me and be able to help others in the family who need to go to school as well and so that in as much as i am furthering my education it does not become that much of a burden on my sponsors because of the percentage of scholarship rendered to me and help with the little money i can earn during the time I'm at Edoofa and be able to help others as well as myself
03/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Elizabeth, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
03/01/24, 1:04 pm - +260 97 1815514: Yes i think i can with the effort my guardians and i are putting forth in order for me to be able to make it and be accepted at Edoofa
03/01/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now Elizabeth, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

04/01/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Elizabeth, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
04/01/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

04/01/24, 10:31 am - +260 97 5387220: Sorry pediatricians
04/01/24, 11:49 am - Gurvinder: Please I am informing you that to get a course in the health sector, you need Physics, Maths, and Chemistry as individual subjects, so the the courses stated below are the following that you can choose from.

04/01/24, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why do you not go for Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, as that aligns with your interest of becoming a paediatrician?
04/01/24, 12:25 pm - +260 97 1815514: I chose bachelor of science in physiotherapy because i have also noticed that there are alot of children born with alot of complications especially with bones were some of them are born with deformed bones and i think i can be of help to them after undergoing the required training

04/01/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
04/01/24, 1:12 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes sir
04/01/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.
04/01/24, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

04/01/24, 1:43 pm - +260 97 5387220: Noted sir thank you very much for that information
04/01/24, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
04/01/24, 1:48 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes sir I'm now very clear about the course
04/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/01/24, 3:08 pm - +260 97 1815514: I can start working immediately provided a job is given to me after completing my studies.I can try to save a bit of money so that even as much as i am working in the public or private sector i am employed in, i can be able to open an institution that teaches about healthy living lifestyles that should later not affect people's movement in the future and as they age and can be offered massages and encouraged to do alot of exercises and encouraging them on how to deal with certain conditions that can affect their health especially their bones and muscles. One that helps those that have movement problems caused by accidents, diseases that they may have suffered from, disorders that they may have been born with or  recently had them due to injury or other factors that might have affected their movements in any way. If i get into Edoofa's program it can help me achieve my dreams by offering me a scholarship that can make it very easy for me to further my studies and make it possible for me to do this course and be able to achieve my future goals
04/01/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Elizabeth I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
04/01/24, 3:20 pm - +260 97 5387220: Yes i am very willing
04/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 97 5387220: Because other countries are more developed as compared to my country and i know that if i study from another country i maybe able to see how other countries are developed and also try my best to help my country when I'm back and also contribute to it's development in one way or another
04/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/01/24, 4:03 pm - +260 97 5387220: I can help by teaching my fellow workers what i have learned and them teaching me what they have learned and we can all put our knowledge and thinking together and we can at least form a Non governmental organisation that is aimed at educating people on ways we can help in contributing to our country's economy and well being. Especially the younger generation for they are the future leaders of tomorrow.
