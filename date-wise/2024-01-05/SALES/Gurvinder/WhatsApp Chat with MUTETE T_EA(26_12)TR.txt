29/12/23, 11:12 am - Tushti: Now, let me brief you about the course you are eligible for

29/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: I believe it would eb a part of the syllabus

I could also work for a government organization, such as the Reserve Bank of India or the National Payments Corporation of India.I would probably be in data analysis, finance and software management...I could help the above organizations make better decisions by analyzing and interpreting data, and l could play a key role in the development and implementation of new technologies.As l progress, l could work as an independent contractor or have my own consulting firm.l would have many options in helping like banking, consulting, healthcare, government, retail, and manufacturing and l would like to participate in business intelligence, supply chain management or security.
29/12/23, 1:28 pm - Tushti: That is really great, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
29/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Counsellor No Offense...I Would Like "Do What It Takes" Percent...I Just Want A Base To Start Then My Father Always Told Me "To Get Anything, You Must Work Very Tireless"

29/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 831 3472: I will take any pill to make sure my career's plan has gone as l wish
29/12/23, 1:56 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 831 3472: I want to be in the business field and Zimbabwe has political and economic stability...It really is a very bad environment to someone who want to study business like me...There are also lack of resources to help me deepen my studies... In Zimbabwe, there are no excellent practical institutions like stable banks that you can go and experience something...Above all, l just want to go out of the country to gain new experiences from countries with one of the most solid economies which would suit my programs
29/12/23, 2:25 pm - Tushti: Wonderful
29/12/23, 2:25 pm - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
29/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 831 3472: I meant economic instability
29/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 831 3472: There are a number of reasons why l want to study in India. First, India has a rich cultural and historical heritage, making it a fascinating place to live and study. Second, India is home to some of the world's leading universities, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Management. Third, India offers a relatively low cost of living compared to many other countries, making.Fourth, India is a fast-growing economy with many opportunities for graduates in fields like engineering, finance, and technology.The Indian education system is vast and diverse, with both public and private institutions. At the primary and secondary level, the education system is mostly public, with a mix of state-run and government-aided schools. At the post-secondary level, there are a wide range of options, including public universities, private universities, technical institutes, and vocational schools. There is also a significant amount of distance learning and online education available. English is widely used as the medium of instruction in the education system, though Hindi and other regional languages are also used in some areas.
29/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 831 3472: The Indian education system is also characterized by its focus on examinations. Grades are very important, and students must pass high-stakes exams in order to advance to the next level of schooling. This system of exams has both benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, it ensures that students are well-prepared for the rigors of university and the workplace. On the other hand, it can lead to a "rote learning" style of education, where students memorize facts and information without truly understanding or engaging with the material. The university system in India is quite unique. There are a large number of universities, both public and private, spread throughout the country. Many of the top universities are affiliated with one of the two major national universities, the University of Delhi and the University of Mumbai. Admission to universities is typically based on performance on the national entrance exams, such as the Joint Entrance Examination or the Common Admission Test. Once admitted, students typically have a great deal of flexibility in choosing their courses and majors.
29/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 831 3472: The Indian education system can help me achieve my goals in a number of ways. First, it provides a strong foundation in the core subjects. Second, it offers a wide range of elective courses that can help you explore your interests and develop your skills. Third, it offers opportunities for internships and work experience, which can be valuable in pursuing your career goals. Finally, it provides connections to the Indian job market, which is growing rapidly and offers many opportunities for skilled and educated individuals. 😊
29/12/23, 2:39 pm - Tushti: Very well researched. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:
29/12/23, 2:39 pm - Tushti: 1. Robust Education System: India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
04/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 78 831 3472: Good Morning Mr Gurvinder...How Are You
04/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
04/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words NAME what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 831 3472: Oh Wow Mr Singh...Thank You For The Education...EDOOFA Really Offers A Chance...
04/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 78 831 3472: You reduce the cost while really offering high quality education...That's wonderful...
04/01/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
