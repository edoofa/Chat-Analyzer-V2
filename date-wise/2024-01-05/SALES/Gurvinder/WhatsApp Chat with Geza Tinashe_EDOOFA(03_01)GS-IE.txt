We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student Abigail

Since you have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Abigail , please reach out to your friend to understand their complete journey and views on the program to attain greater clarity and understanding about the program. In the meantime, can you also please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?

03/01/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
03/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship  as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
03/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 696 3527: No she didn't
03/01/24, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.

03/01/24, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

04/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
04/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/01/24, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 530 9893: Then Y ask personal questions
04/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 696 3527: So sir is the counseling done
04/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what is the concern, since it is about evaluating your child's application, I would like to know a bit more about educational background of the family and what is your lookout about higher education in the first place?
04/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 530 9893: My level of education is none of your businesses
04/01/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Why not Mr Geza, since you are looking forward for your child's higher education. Would you be sharing the same responses if your interview was being held in person for UZ's admission?
