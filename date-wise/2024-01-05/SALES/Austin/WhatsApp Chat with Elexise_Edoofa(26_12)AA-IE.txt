26/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: Noted
26/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
26/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 441 4013: Yes l am very much confident
26/12/23, 3:13 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
26/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 441 4013: I did my research but this is my first time to apply to a University abroad
26/12/23, 3:16 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

27/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 441 4013: My knowledge on the lndian education system is that it gives me an opportunity to be exposed to different cultures and helps me understand people from different backgrounds.
The Education System helps me to  get a chance to be exposed to both the practical and the theory side of the job.
It helps me gain global recognition as lndian degrees are globally recognized . 
The Indian Education System is also rich in culture and makes me highly employable.
27/12/23, 9:24 am - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge
27/12/23, 9:24 am - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
27/12/23, 9:24 am - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.

Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system.

Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
27/12/23, 9:24 am - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
27/12/23, 9:24 am - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique.

27/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 441 4013: By studying in lndia l will be able to get a degree which will be recognized globally and this will create a smooth path for fulfilling my career.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
27/12/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 441 4013: Without any scholarship the cost specifically in lndia may range from $5000- $6000
27/12/23, 9:59 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 10:00 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:00 am - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
27/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 441 4013: I think they can afford
27/12/23, 10:04 am - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
27/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 441 4013: No
27/12/23, 10:06 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
27/12/23, 10:06 am - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
27/12/23, 10:06 am - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
27/12/23, 10:06 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
27/12/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
27/12/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje

27/12/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
27/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 441 4013: I think the Earn While You Learn Program is a very good program for students from poor background especially from my country as it helps them achieve their dreams
27/12/23, 10:18 am - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
27/12/23, 10:18 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 441 4013: Yes l will definitely be benefiting from the program
27/12/23, 10:19 am - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
27/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 78 441 4013: Yes l have gone through it
27/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 441 4013: I hope to follow suit
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
27/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 441 4013: 3
27/12/23, 10:31 am - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

27/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 441 4013: Thank you it is really encouraging
27/12/23, 10:38 am - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
27/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 441 4013: My mother
27/12/23, 10:43 am - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with her after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
27/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 441 4013: That is their wish because they have high expectations from me
27/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 441 4013: Ok
27/12/23, 10:46 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
27/12/23, 10:46 am - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
27/12/23, 10:46 am - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
27/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 441 4013: Yes it is
27/12/23, 10:50 am - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
27/12/23, 10:50 am - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
27/12/23, 10:50 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:50 am - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
27/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 441 4013: Yes
27/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
27/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 441 4013: Okay, thank you
27/12/23, 11:06 am - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
27/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 441 4013: Ok l understand
27/12/23, 11:11 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 441 4013: Stage 1
27/12/23, 11:15 am - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
27/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 441 4013: Yes
27/12/23, 11:16 am - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
27/12/23, 11:16 am - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
27/12/23, 11:16 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
27/12/23, 11:16 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
27/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 441 4013: In which year am l going to be enrolled because l am yet to write my Advanced level examinations
27/12/23, 11:25 am - Arshita: You will be getting enrolled now so that you can begin your EWYL journey. 

You will be arriving in India in 2024
27/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 441 4013: I will be writing my final examinations in October 2024 so l wanted to be enrolled in 2025
27/12/23, 11:46 am - Arshita: That is well noted. 

We have already opened the slots for 2025 intake
27/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 441 4013: Okay so what do l do now
27/12/23, 11:49 am - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

28/12/23, 11:40 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 11:40 am - Arshita: Dear parents @263775776689 @263776424175  , Before we proceed, it is important that you are on the same page and fully support this path in your child's career! Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?*. Your acknowledgement is mandatory to proceed and do not hesitate to share if you have any challenges.
28/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 642 4175: Ok let me go through the letter
28/12/23, 11:58 am - Arshita: Sure
28/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 642 4175: May you please clarify on this issue, after going through your letter l noticed were it is written " a child can apply after final exams or during last year in school as for my child her last year in school is 2024 and then she will be eligible for tertiary education in 2025 so l don't know if we are in the right track or she applied earlier than expected
28/12/23, 12:13 pm - Arshita: You are absolutely right!
28/12/23, 12:13 pm - Arshita: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.

In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

28/12/23, 12:30 pm - Arshita: Please acknowledge the same
28/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 642 4175: Yes we acknowledge as parents
28/12/23, 12:39 pm - Arshita: If we begin the eligibility check stage of Elexise today, it would be of 1-2 days after which her results will be out which means if she qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall in the first week of January. Are you comfortable with the timeframe?
28/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 642 4175: I,m affected by the time frame there becoz l will get money on the 16th of January that will be my pay day

So considering your challenges,  if I request a payment plan for you to our Academic Board in such a way that you can pay $100 in seven days and the remaining $100 on 18th if Elexise qualifies for the Edoofa scholarship program, do you think it will be feasible for you?
28/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 642 4175: Thank you it will be fine by me
28/12/23, 1:01 pm - Arshita: That is well noted

04/01/24, 8:39 pm - Austin: That is wonderful!
04/01/24, 8:44 pm - Austin: For all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration of 20 months in the following manner

*1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 13 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country. 

*2. Parents' Communication with the Admission's Team:* Having ample time at hand benefits not only the student but also allows parents to better plan their child's international education journey. To leverage this advantage, you will engage with the admissions team immediately after completing your enrollment process, preparing for your child's academic journey in the 2025 intake. Admission Officers will assist you in proper financial planning for the 25 academic year. This means it's the right time to start saving for your child's annual fees after scholarship, and if you face any challenges, they can be addressed in advance. Motive of financial planning would be to ensure that all the parents are in a much better position in terms of finances by August 2024, once financial planning is completed till August 2024, you'll start receiving Offer Letters from the Universities around September/October 2024. This gives you the advantage of selecting the University of your choice. This process offers convenience to parents as the Admission Officers assist in financial preparation, alleviating any burdens towards the end.

*3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
04/01/24, 8:48 pm - +263 77 642 4175: Ok thank you so much l,ve understood now
04/01/24, 9:07 pm - Austin: You are most welcome, what else would you like to ask me please?
04/01/24, 9:15 pm - +263 77 642 4175: No more questions Sir thank you
