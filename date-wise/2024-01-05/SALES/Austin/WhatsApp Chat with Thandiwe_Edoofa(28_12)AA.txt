29/12/23, 8:35 am - Arshita: Please answer this
29/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 712 9763: I am 18 years old. My biggest weakness is fear of failure it tends to hold me back. I also do not perform well under  pressure. Being ambitious is my strength , the ambition motivates me to work harder. On my free time I like reading novels and playing ball games like hand ball as well as doing exercises like jogging and running.  My father is a farmer but he also gets job offers in South Africa for a month or two. My mother is a housewife but she sometimes helps my father at the farm. I have 3 siblings and they are all still studying. 

1. I  currently finished my A level and I was doing Accounting,  Business Studies and Economics. 

2. I would like to study hotel management and culinary arts because I am passionate about cooking and would love to work in that field. Cooking for my family never felt like a chore rather a hobby that brings me peace and happiness.Being the eldest daughter in the family I would always cook for the family. Getting to hear their compliments made me dream of becoming a chef or a hotel manager one day so I made it my aim to work towards that dream.

3. My father is a farmer and my mother is a housewife. 

4. Both my parent's highest educational level is high school.

29/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 712 9763: Accounting , Business Studies and Economics
29/12/23, 9:14 am - Arshita: Noted
29/12/23, 9:14 am - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
29/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 712 9763: Yes I am
29/12/23, 9:18 am - Arshita: That is well noted
29/12/23, 9:18 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
29/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 712 9763: Yes I did my research and sent enquiries to some universities.
29/12/23, 9:22 am - Arshita: May I know where have you applied?
29/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 712 9763: Chandigarh Vidya Jyoti Eduversity and Parul University
29/12/23, 9:31 am - Arshita: Have you got the acceptance letter?
29/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 712 9763: No
29/12/23, 9:37 am - Arshita: First of all, the degree shared by Parul Universities are not recognized on a global level, if after spending $3000 for education abroad, degrees are not considered in other countries, would that be a worthwhile investment?
29/12/23, 9:37 am - Arshita: *The most important reason is that the University isn't ranked under the  NIRF ranking under the Ministry of Education of the Government of India!*
29/12/23, 9:37 am - Arshita: https://www.nirfindia.org/2021/Ranking.html

This is the Official Website of ranking of Colleges and Universities by Ministry of Education under Government of India and you will be surprised to see that Parul University *is not even a part of this ranking*
29/12/23, 9:37 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
29/12/23, 9:37 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>

03/01/24, 9:47 am - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
03/01/24, 9:47 am - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
03/01/24, 9:47 am - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
03/01/24, 9:47 am - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
03/01/24, 9:47 am - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
03/01/24, 9:47 am - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
03/01/24, 9:47 am - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
03/01/24, 9:47 am - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

03/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 712 9763: Upon doing my own research I discovered that India is one of the highest ranking in terms of culinary arts which is what I'm aiming to pursue. So with the diverse cuisines in India it is a wonderful opportunity to learn more about different cultures and to widen the horizon in terms of future opportunities and endeavors. Studying in India will enable me to learn more about culinary arts due to its diversity which will open several opportunities for me in the future for my career. India is also a destination for tourists so studying there will enable me to interact with people from different cultures and this will be assist me in my career since it requires me to be able to interact with people from different works of life. The internships will also assist me to achieve my career since I will be learning from the best chefs and best lecturers.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
03/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 712 9763: Yes I am
03/01/24, 10:31 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

03/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 712 9763: Yes
03/01/24, 10:36 am - Arshita: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
03/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 712 9763: Yes through the learn while you earn program
03/01/24, 10:39 am - Arshita: Absolutely, Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable through the *Earn While You Learn Program*
03/01/24, 10:39 am - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
03/01/24, 10:40 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
03/01/24, 10:40 am - Arshita: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
03/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 77 712 9763: I think the Earn While You Learn Program is a great program that makes every  student's tuition to be affordable and reduce the burden of taking loans to the family of every student since the student will earning through scholarship credits based on their performance.
The EWYL program gives students more experience in their field through the projects they will be doing and they will also learn new things through the program.

I think I will also benefit through the EWYL program. It will not only reduce the burden of paying my tuition fee to my family but will also give me the opportunity  to gain more experience through the projects I will be given.
03/01/24, 10:58 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 77 712 9763: Yes I do thank you
03/01/24, 11:09 am - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
03/01/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 712 9763: I think number 2 is the most significant
03/01/24, 11:20 am - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

03/01/24, 11:21 am - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
03/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 77 712 9763: My father will be helping me
03/01/24, 11:45 am - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with him after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
03/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 712 9763: Yes I will be discussing with him 

My family feels like studying abroad would be a great opportunity for me considering the program I would like study. Additionally with slim job opportunities in my country studying abroad would open several job opportunities for  me in other countries as well especially  studying culinary arts in India since it's  also a ranking country in studying culinary arts.
03/01/24, 11:58 am - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
03/01/24, 11:59 am - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
03/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 712 9763: No I don't
03/01/24, 12:01 pm - Arshita: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
03/01/24, 12:01 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 12:01 pm - Arshita: To sum up, shall I inform you why and when the enrollment fee is paid?
03/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 712 9763: Yes please
03/01/24, 12:04 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
03/01/24, 12:04 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 712 9763: Ok thank you
03/01/24, 12:08 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 712 9763: Stage number 4
03/01/24, 12:17 pm - Arshita: Excellect, so let me now guide you through step 5&6
03/01/24, 12:17 pm - Arshita: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
03/01/24, 12:17 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
03/01/24, 12:17 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
03/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 712 9763: Yes I am thank you
03/01/24, 12:24 pm - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
03/01/24, 12:24 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

They were happy with the Earn While You Learn program since it will reduce the cost of paying my tuition fee and I will be able to get the best education at an affordable fee that will not leave them in debts.
Both my parents support me when it comes to my education and they think that studying in India would open several job opportunities for me once I am done with the course.
04/01/24, 12:29 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session!
