As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
04/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 71 559 3216: Yes am ready
04/01/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Daisy,
How are you doing today?
04/01/24, 10:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
04/01/24, 10:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: *So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
