29/12/23, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure

29/12/23, 10:57 am - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes ..and this sounds also better. So she can pursue this course for sure
29/12/23, 11:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
29/12/23, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
29/12/23, 11:05 am - +265 999 52 82 02: I may not know the exact figures but I know it's very expensive studying abroad
29/12/23, 11:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Mr. Christopher, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/12/23, 11:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.


*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to you and your family?* <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 11:29 am - +265 999 52 82 02: No...as a family we can't afford...but I guess we were told that this is a wholly sponsored education?? So I wonder that this issue of additional payment is coming in ?
29/12/23, 11:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Christopher, Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
29/12/23, 11:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
29/12/23, 11:46 am - +265 999 52 82 02: Of course..I learned from other people who have gone through other scholarships per say...but was of the view that yours is a wholly sponsored education regardless of the factors raised above
29/12/23, 11:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
29/12/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/12/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/12/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/12/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/12/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
29/12/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
29/12/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
29/12/23, 11:57 am - +265 999 52 82 02: Can we break probably up to 18:00 today? Am on afternoon shift and won't be able to respond because of the nature of my work.....
29/12/23, 12:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, But Mr. Christopher, please note that we currently have a high volume of applicants participating in one-on-one counseling sessions, and there is a queue of individuals awaiting their turn. However, as we have a limited number of available seats, it is crucial for you to actively engage in the session and follow through with the necessary steps to secure your child's spot.
29/12/23, 12:09 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: Ok understood
29/12/23, 12:11 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: It is so much beneficial...no question about that...
29/12/23, 12:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
29/12/23, 12:29 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes...in this case it looks to be bearable at least
29/12/23, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, are willing to continue with the program for Winnie? <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 12:47 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes am willing
29/12/23, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
29/12/23, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.

29/12/23, 1:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/12/23, 1:16 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: I'll be striving for it myself ...if I see that it's not possible then I will give in.
29/12/23, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feels about Winnie studying abroad?
29/12/23, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 5:40 am - +265 999 52 82 02: Discussed fully with the family and we need to forge ahead with the discussion...
02/01/24, 9:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*“The only way to have a life is to commit to it like crazy.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
02/01/24, 10:41 am - +265 999 52 82 02: Good morning


Yes we can
02/01/24, 10:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
02/01/24, 10:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Winnie, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
02/01/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
02/01/24, 11:30 am - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes it is..
02/01/24, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
02/01/24, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
02/01/24, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 11:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
02/01/24, 11:40 am - +265 999 52 82 02: Yes for sure..as to fully understand
02/01/24, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let me explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid.
02/01/24, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/01/24, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/01/24, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
02/01/24, 12:03 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: Thank you and am following
02/01/24, 1:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay as I was having my lunch.
02/01/24, 1:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 1:59 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: I think we are on position 5....
02/01/24, 2:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
02/01/24, 4:24 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: 🫣🫣...

Thought we've made progress...

Yes explain please to me
02/01/24, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
02/01/24, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
02/01/24, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
02/01/24, 4:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Are we connected, Winnie?
02/01/24, 4:31 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: Surely so
02/01/24, 4:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
02/01/24, 4:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. Please excuse me for the delay as I got a bit occupied with the evaluations of applicants.

Are you ready for the session?
04/01/24, 2:34 pm - Austin: Greetings Mrs Labanna and Winnie,
How are you today?
04/01/24, 2:34 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 3:09 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: This is Christopher Labanna, the father of Winnie
04/01/24, 3:10 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: This is very encouraging and how I could've wished my daughter to be among the chosen ones..but am afraid with her performance it is just not good enough.
04/01/24, 3:12 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 3:18 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Mr Labanna!
04/01/24, 3:18 pm - Austin: I do understand and have you considered the minimum eligibility requirement for the Edoofa program?
04/01/24, 3:19 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: No...I was of the view of the average grade of my lad
04/01/24, 3:24 pm - Austin: Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

We accept upto 7=pass for a subject. Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35. This would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program. The minimum requirement was higher before the pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!
04/01/24, 3:50 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: Aggregate of 35 for 5 subjects..I guess we go for the best 6 subjects? Or your requirements goes for the best 5? I need a clear view here Sir.
04/01/24, 3:54 pm - Austin: We go for the best 5 subjects and the aggregate needs to be equal to or less than 35 to qualify which is a fair chance but we encourage students to go for the best
04/01/24, 4:28 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: Ok I understand now <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 4:29 pm - Austin: Noted, do you have other questions for me?
04/01/24, 4:29 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: No...as of now no
04/01/24, 4:29 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: We may progress our discussions anyway
04/01/24, 4:30 pm - Austin: That is fine, 

May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
04/01/24, 4:34 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: It's abit fare as compared to start from the scratch... meaning say paying the whole school fees for oneself. But if the chance is given for my ward then I'll strive to assist her
04/01/24, 4:49 pm - Austin: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
04/01/24, 4:49 pm - Austin: Is Winnie available?
04/01/24, 4:51 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: She's out..

But anything discussed we always share
04/01/24, 4:57 pm - Austin: This is well noted, when will Winnie be available?
04/01/24, 5:01 pm - +265 999 52 82 02: Late evening sir

Any message to her will be gratefully passed to her
04/01/24, 5:01 pm - Austin: So Winnie, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
