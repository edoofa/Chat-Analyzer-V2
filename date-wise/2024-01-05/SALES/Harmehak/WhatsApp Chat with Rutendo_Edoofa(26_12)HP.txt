27/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Well received, Nigel, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
27/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 993 1858: Okay..
27/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 993 1858: Thanks for the light
27/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
27/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 993 1858: That is correct
27/12/23, 9:41 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Nigel, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
27/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 78 993 1858: Okay
27/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Yes please
27/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 275 8388: Thank you for highlighting this about the scholarships,am very grateful that your scholarships stretch to cover as far as 100%,my concern is if you can make Nigel  eligible for that one I mean the 100% scholarship since he is someone raised by a single parent ,his father passed on when he was just 4years and as a mother I struggled in sending him to school so for his tertiary education I would appreciate very much if you assist him
27/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 993 1858: My name in Nigel Rutendo Zimunya and lm a boy aged 19.lm a boy who likes dancing and lm a gud handball player.l did my  O ' level at Bradley High School where l attained 3 As 4Bs and 3 Cs....l then went for A level at Chipindura High School where l did Sciences(Geography,Software Engineering,Mathematics) and l attained  8 points thus a B in Geo,C in Software Engineering and an E in Mathematics.As for me l have always admired and liked the Engineering field....and lm sure that's where my strengths are...
27/12/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: I am very sorry for your loss please.
27/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 993 1858: In our family we are 4 that's my mom who is a teacher and us the 3 boys...thats Rukudzo who is 25 years old,Rufaro 23 years old and me....We were raised by a single parent since 2008 coz that's when my father passed away so life has been hard for us...
27/12/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship please?
27/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 275 8388: Covering the Tuition fees and accommodation ,I stand to be corrected
27/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
27/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 993 1858: Okay
27/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 993 1858: Got it
27/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 275 8388: Got it thank you
27/12/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please

27/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
27/12/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: So Nigel, may I know more about your siblings please?

What is their current profession?
27/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 993 1858: The first one not yet working...his at home....en the other one, his schooling
27/12/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
27/12/23, 10:28 am - Harmehak: Well Nigel, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
27/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 993 1858: Yes
27/12/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
27/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 993 1858: Yes lm ready
27/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Nigel, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
27/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 993 1858: Yes everyone is aware and they proud of me bcoz of this commitment to study abroad
27/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 993 1858: Yes they are ready and willing to support me
27/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Nigel!

May I know who would be the one supporting you financially and what profession they are in please?

27/12/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Rutendo, are you aware that Edoofa is proudly associated with your school, Chipindura High as well?
27/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 993 1858: Nope...l wasn't aware of that
27/12/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: How exciting it is to know the same now?
27/12/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 993 1858: I'm surprised and glad l guess🤗☺️
27/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 993 1858: I know this guy...he was our President 🔥🤗
27/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 993 1858: Wow...this is nice 👍
27/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Rutendo!
27/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
27/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 993 1858: Okay noted ....and lm confident
27/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: That's great
27/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: Kindly share your results in a picture format, Nigel.
27/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 993 1858: O 'level or A 'level

27/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: Both please
27/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 993 1858: Okay
27/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 78 993 1858: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 78 993 1858: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Duly received please
27/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Engineering, Rutendo?
27/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 993 1858: Since l was a kid l have Always liked fixing broken things it's my passion....and my brother his studying engineering too ....so it's in us l guess🤷‍♂️
27/12/23, 11:15 am - Harmehak: Well that's good,

What all did you research about Engineering along with the requirements, Nigel?
27/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 993 1858: Like what it's engineering and what do engineers do as well as the program l want .Requirements yes
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Your basic research along with the requirements please.
27/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 993 1858: Engineering its a process of using natural sciences,mathematics and engineering design to increase efficincey and improve productivity...Basic requirements are Mathematics and Physics.4 types of engineering are Civil,Chemical,Mechanical and Electrical
27/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Well received, Rutendo.

I am glad you have awareness!
27/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: So why didn't you pursue Physics in your A level?
27/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 993 1858: Coz l didn't qualify for Physics 🤷‍♂️
27/12/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
27/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 993 1858: Yep l understand tht but sometimes that is stong personel profile someone has can be important as an academic one
27/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate for me?
27/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 993 1858: Lyk the passion someone has for a certain program can make someone qualify 🤷‍♂️ for tht program
27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 993 1858: And lm organised, hard working, good listener and learner and lm sure these characteristics are so much needed in Engineering
27/12/23, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: No please, Physics is a strict requirement, Rutendo!

I believe you must be aware that Physics is a mandatory requirement even in Zimbabwe, isn't it?
27/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Yah it is🙁
27/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 993 1858: So l don't qualify for engineering...so which programs best suits me...
27/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Yes please

27/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
27/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 993 1858: My battery is about to die....so can we plizz continue maybe later if possible???
27/12/23, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Margaret can participate if available.
27/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Okay
27/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 993 1858: No
27/12/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
27/12/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
27/12/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
27/12/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Okay noted
27/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 993 1858: What is the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM??
27/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Rutendo, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Okay got it
27/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: Excuse me please
27/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: So what are your thoughts on the same, Rutendo?
27/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 993 1858: It's nyc....it's affordable
27/12/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
27/12/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: I shall brief you!
27/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Rutendo, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
27/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 993 1858: That's right
27/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Okay
27/12/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
27/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Yep....l now understand..
27/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 993 1858: It's affordable...compared to other countries
27/12/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
27/12/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/12/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
27/12/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

27/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Okay okay....l understand
27/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Wow it's a nyc program
27/12/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please
27/12/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Okay .wow it's a nyc  program
27/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 993 1858: So you can even cover your annual fee with the EWYL Program...just depend on ur hard work???
27/12/23, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Rutendo.
27/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Ohh this is nice 👍
27/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Yes
27/12/23, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
27/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Wait
27/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please?
27/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Yep lm ready
27/12/23, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: Nigel, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
27/12/23, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 993 1858: $1500-2250
27/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
27/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Rutendo, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
27/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Yes l think so
27/12/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/12/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/12/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Okay
27/12/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
27/12/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
27/12/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
27/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Yah l understand
27/12/23, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
27/12/23, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
27/12/23, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

27/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 993 1858: Okay okay 👍
27/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

To a lesser extent stagnant and inefficient farms are causing poor diets in African societies because to a larger extent there are other factors leading to poor diets in African societies which are Economic,Social and Political which are going to be discussed below÷


To a larger extent there are other factors leading to poor diets in African societies which are Economic,Social and Political like÷Recurring drought,conflict and instability have led to severe food shortages leading to poor nutrition.There is also poverty which is leading to severe hunger thus poor diets .Alcohol and drug abuse contributes also to poor diets in African countries.Lack of government and community support systems for families in need.Natural disasters like floods,Cyclones have destroyed food stores leading to shortages of food supply causing poor diets in African societies.

SECTION 6

Deep down in the roots of Chivhu there was a young man named Rutendo. One day he was once walking through the woods when he came across a wise old owl perched on a tree branch.He then took a while and asked the owl the secret to live a good life .The owl looked down at the boy and replied, "The secret is to always be kind to others, even when they are not kind to you." The boy thought about this and then asked himself if someone was really mean to him and what he should do then.The owl then encouraged him to be kind at all cost. Whilst she was in his confusion state he wondered how he can be kind to someone who is being mean to him. The Owl smiled at him and told him sometimes the kindest thing to do is simply walking away.One can not control how other people behave but can control
how to react to them. He was surprised to find that as he practiced kindness, he began to feel happier and more at peace. He also noticed that the people around him seemed to be kinder, too. And whenever someone was unkind, he followed the owl's advice and walked away. In this way, he was able to create a life filled with happiness and peace. And he never forgot the owl's wise words: "The secret to living a good life is to always be kind to others, even when they are not kind to you."
The boy carried this lesson with him for the rest of his life, and he passed it on to others.

29/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
29/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
29/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
29/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 275 8388: Thank you for highlighting this important information,I have understood what you have said and am prepared to pay the $350.
29/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 275 8388: That's great👏👏
29/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 4th or 5th January 2023 for $200 and the  4th or 5th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 4th or 5th January 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
29/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 275 8388: I opt for the first one

02/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Having counseled your entire application so far and with our discussion with the Academic Board considering your interests and desired fields, Bachelor of Computer Applications would be a great choice for you, Nigel.

You see both Bachelor of science in Computer Science and Bachelor of Computer Applications cater for interests related to Computer itself, however Bachelor of Computer Applications would be an ideal course for you.

What is your take on the same, having gone through both the descriptions?
02/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: @263789931858
02/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 993 1858: I will stick with Computer Science

You're very welcome please.
03/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 78 993 1858: Morning morning Ms Harmehak
03/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 78 993 1858: Yes please
03/01/24, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Were you able to thoroughly go through your Acceptance Letter, Rutendo?
03/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 78 993 1858: Yes
03/01/24, 10:18 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Were you able to discuss with your mother too?
03/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 78 993 1858: Yes
03/01/24, 10:19 am - Harmehak: I am glad
03/01/24, 10:19 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries for me?
03/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 993 1858: No...
03/01/24, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

In that case, shall I brief you about the Payment modes?
03/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 993 1858: Yes
03/01/24, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
03/01/24, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

03/01/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything?
03/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 993 1858: No, so far everything is gud
