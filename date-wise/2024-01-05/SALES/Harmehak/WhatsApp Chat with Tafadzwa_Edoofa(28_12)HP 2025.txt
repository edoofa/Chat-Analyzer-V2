You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
02/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 78 887 1981: It is a program that is dedicated to transform people's lives through granting them scholarships, people who are eligible and also to guide people through quality education abroad

02/01/24, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Tafadzwa
02/01/24, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: What did you learn about the finances involved?
02/01/24, 4:38 pm - +263 78 887 1981: I learned that most of the scholarships you can pay up to 2000 to 3000 per year
02/01/24, 4:38 pm - +263 78 887 1981: Yes we are
02/01/24, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted
02/01/24, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: I believe you understood the following?
02/01/24, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.* <This message was edited>
02/01/24, 5:25 pm - +263 78 887 1981: OK understood clearly
02/01/24, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: Have you discussed the same with your mother Tafadzwa?
02/01/24, 6:00 pm - +263 78 887 1981: Yes I have but not everything I just briefed her that she wound be surprised
02/01/24, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!

So far, do you have any queries for me?
02/01/24, 6:12 pm - +263 78 887 1981: Uuuuhm not really but will
02/01/24, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted!

So far, what is your take on the finances involved?
02/01/24, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Tafadzwa, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/01/24, 6:20 pm - +263 78 887 1981: Yes
02/01/24, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, given an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program, Tafadzwa?
02/01/24, 6:56 pm - +263 78 887 1981: I did not really understand your question plizz
02/01/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: After comparing the costs in Zimbabwe and in India,

Are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tafadzwa?

Along with the opportunity of the Earn While You Learn Program.
02/01/24, 7:07 pm - +263 78 887 1981: Uuum I think it is because of the eligible people they offer scholars and also from the earn while you learn programme
02/01/24, 9:49 pm - Harmehak: Yes Tafadzwa,

Do discuss the same in detail with your mother.
02/01/24, 9:49 pm - +263 78 887 1981: OK I will
02/01/24, 9:49 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
03/01/24, 9:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/01/24, 9:08 am - +263 78 887 1981: Yes and good mrng
03/01/24, 9:13 am - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough discussion with your mother, Tafadzwa?
03/01/24, 9:16 am - +263 78 887 1981: Yes
03/01/24, 9:17 am - Harmehak: What all did you discuss with her, Tafadzwa?
03/01/24, 9:18 am - +263 78 887 1981: I explained to her the good of Eedofa and how much it offers and also that it grants people a chance to go study abroad and the few amount she will have to pay if I'm given a scholarship rather than without a scholar
03/01/24, 9:24 am - Harmehak: That's great,

I am glad you had a thorough discussion.
03/01/24, 9:28 am - +263 78 887 1981: Ok
03/01/24, 9:30 am - Harmehak: So is she willing to support you financially with roughly $1200-1500 a year, Tafadzwa?
03/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 887 1981: Yes she is
03/01/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Tafadzwa, earlier you happened to mention financial instability as well!

So may I know what is your mother's financial planning to support you?
03/01/24, 9:33 am - +263 78 887 1981: She's a vendor
03/01/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Yes please, you shared the same with me.
03/01/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly read my question?
03/01/24, 9:40 am - +263 78 887 1981: She just said I'm willing to support you my son if that will help in your education that's all
03/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
03/01/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Could you kindly share more details about your mother's profession?

Specifically, in which province does she operate, and could you elaborate on the nature of her work in vending? What products or services does she deal with in this profession, and how long has she been involved in it?
03/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 78 887 1981: She's in Masvingo Province, Chiredzi and she grills maize cones and sells and also ground nuts
03/01/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
03/01/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
