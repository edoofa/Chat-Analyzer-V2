We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.

28/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
28/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 339 9947: Good morning ma'am
28/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 339 9947: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Very well put across, Zvikomborero.

28/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Zvikomborero, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

28/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 71 339 9947: Yes my mother is aware and she is willing to support my higher education abroad both mentally and financially..

28/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 339 9947: Thank you

28/12/23, 9:46 am - Harmehak: We will discuss everything in detail!
28/12/23, 9:46 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
28/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 339 9947: Okay ma'am
28/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 339 9947: Yes I am confident

28/12/23, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor in Psychology - Bachelor in Psychology* is a 3-year undergraduate course.

*What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*

In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.

 *What is it about?*

Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.

BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.

28/12/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
28/12/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 339 9947: No we don't
28/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
28/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/12/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/12/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Okay it's affordable
28/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 339 9947: So you will be staying on the school campus right
28/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Zvikomborero, let me help you have better clarity about the same please

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
28/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 339 9947: That's great 😊
28/12/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
28/12/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
28/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 339 9947: It's a good idea
28/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 339 9947: So can I ask the $8000 is it for the whole year
28/12/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: $8000 is the fee per year for international students in India without any scholarship, Zvikomborero.
28/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Okay I understand
28/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 339 9947: So how will I get the scholarship because I really need it . I know my mom won't be able to raise $8000
28/12/23, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: We are currently in the process for same itself.
28/12/23, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: I hope you have understood that cost after the scholarship is ,$2000-3000 and the same can be further reduced through the Earn While You Learn Program?
28/12/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Zvikomborero.
28/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Okay ma'am
28/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Okay I understand
28/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same?
28/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Sorry ma'am I had gone to eat lunch
28/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
28/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
28/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Zvikomborero, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
28/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 339 9947: I agree
28/12/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Zvikomborero?
28/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
28/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

28/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Okay ma'am
28/12/23, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Zvikomborero.
28/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 339 9947: I have finished reading
28/12/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Thats good
28/12/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Wow this is wonderful
28/12/23, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 339 9947: This is excellent ma'am
28/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 339 9947: I did like to be like this student
28/12/23, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
28/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Yes I am
28/12/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Zvikomborero as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
28/12/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Okay
28/12/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Please?
28/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 339 9947: $300 × 5= $1500
$450 × 5 =$2250
28/12/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/12/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
28/12/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: You see, Zvikomborero, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 339 9947: This is better
28/12/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
28/12/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 339 9947: Okay I understand
28/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 339 9947: This is a great idea
28/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
28/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
28/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

28/12/23, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

I am glad you are willing to support Zvikomborero and it's great that you are connected with Mrs Ruth too!
29/12/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
29/12/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
29/12/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
29/12/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 7:38 pm - +267 75 919 129: Thats true
29/12/23, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
29/12/23, 7:40 pm - +267 75 919 129: Ok
29/12/23, 7:40 pm - +267 75 919 129: Ok thats great
29/12/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 6th or 7th January 2023 for $200 and the  6th or 7th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 6th or 7th January 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
29/12/23, 7:47 pm - +267 75 919 129: Ok i dont know if its possible to change the dates now like something i wasnt aware of ,i am busy preparing for back to school now  the fees ,tuck and uniforms
29/12/23, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: I do understand the same considering your challenges,

By when are you expecting to pay the first installment of $200 if Zvikomborero is found eligible?
29/12/23, 7:50 pm - +267 75 919 129: Towards monthend of January
29/12/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: While the Academic Board understand your challenges, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. 

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Zvikomborero's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. *As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.*

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it? <This message was edited>

It is true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient

Across the African continent the issues of poor diets is affecting the health and well being of millions of people.

Many Africans have poor diets this is because of the limited agricultural productivity.The stagnant and inefficient farms often result in low agricultural productivity.Some farmers in Africa are not exposed to the morden farming.

The other factor which is affecting the poor diet is lack of crop diversification.Farmers do have lack of farm innovation and technology hampers  about the growing of crops. Some of these African farmers reply on their staple crops which is not right.The insufficient crop diversification limits dietary diversity and contributes to nutrient deficiency .

The poor harvest losses which happen in farms lead to hunger and starvation.When this occurs it later leads to death of people. A poor diet leads to certain diseases like kwashiorkor.

Since the farms in Africa are stagnant there is a limited access to most resources.The small scale farmers in Africa often face challenges in accessing their resources for example fertilizer and the morden machinery . These small scale farmers sometimes have limited financial support and inadequate machinery which later hinders their ability to adopt efficient farming practices which leads to farm productivity.

These farmers also face climate change and environmental degradation.The African farmers are at risk because of the climate change, droughts and pests . Sometimes rainfall makes everything worse since the plants need water to grow .The soil erosion and deforestation reduces agricultural productivity and worsens the challenges faced by farmers.

The lack of knowledge and training is also leading to the Africans having a poor diet . Most farmers in Africa lack access to education, training and also some information on morden sustainable farming practices.Thr lack of knowledge on the effective irrigation techniques , pest management and soil conservation practices limits the ability to improve farm productivity and it also overcomes the challenges associated with the stagnant farms.

These challenges which are leading to poor diets should at least be addressed. The farmers should go to farming school. At least if the government manages to prioritize farmers so that they can get knowledge about sustainable farming practices. These initiatives should at least focus on promoting the crop diversification, soil conservation and climate smart agriculture which enables the farmers to adapt to changing conditions and improve their yields.

The farmers should also enhance in marketing access. The government should support the marketing system and develop efficient supply chains to connect the farmers with the consumers . This will help the farmers to obtain fair prices for their produce.

These African farmers should collaborate. They should partner with the government, non-governmental and international entities.They will be addressing the challenges faced by stagnant inefficient farms. The collaboration efforts can facilitate knowledge,sharing ideas and also implementation of effective strategies to improve agriculture productivity and promote healthier diets.

While it is true that many Africans have poor diets due to stagnant and inefficient farms there are viable solutions to address this issue . Overcoming the challenges faced by stagnant and inefficient farms is a critical step towards achieving food Security and promoting healthier diets across the African continent.

"My Inspirational Story "

My inspirational story is based on characteristics that I am going to study about.

Firstly I want to study about the Bachelor in Psychology. In this case I will be studying mainly about the human behavior and mental processes. I did like to be diagnosing and treating psychological disorders as well as to promote mental health and well being.

I will be using various techniques and approaches to help the client address his or her emotional behavior, or psychological challenges and enhance one's overall mental well being.

As a psychologist I did like to do some scientific researches inorder for me to expand the knowledge and understanding of human behavior and the mental processes.As a psychologist I did like to design studies , collect and also to analyse data . I will be covering a wide range of certain areas like social behavior and mental health.

As a psychologist I also would want to teach and at least supervise the students. I will be mentoring the students who will be doing degrees in psychology. I will be providing them with certain instructions on various psychological theories. As for supervision I will be supervision I will be supervising and training those aspiring psychologist and counseling them.

Lastly I did like to be consulting some services of organizations , schools , business and also other professional. I will be offering some knowledge in areas such as organizational behavior, human resources and educational assessment. I will also be providing guidance and some strategies.

04/01/24, 8:55 pm - +267 75 919 129: Thats great ma'am
Im doing well thanks
04/01/24, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: I am glad,

Have you thoroughly gone through the acceptance letter please?
04/01/24, 8:59 pm - +267 75 919 129: Not yet finish let me go through it this night
04/01/24, 9:00 pm - Harmehak: I would appreciate the same please!

Meanwhile shall I brief you about the payment modes as we speak?
04/01/24, 9:18 pm - +267 75 919 129: Yes ma'am
04/01/24, 9:18 pm - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
04/01/24, 9:18 pm - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
