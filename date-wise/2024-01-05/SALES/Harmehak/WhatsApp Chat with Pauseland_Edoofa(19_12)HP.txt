20/12/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Pauseland, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
20/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Yes l agree with you, commitment from parents is very important.

They are all aware of my plans and are very willing to support me even mentally , they are very supportive of my desire to study abroad but they are not in a position to financially support me due to their disadvantaged circumstances
20/12/23, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Pauseland,

So can you please elaborate your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
20/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay l understand that the financial aspect of this program includes tuition fee so what l meant is that my parents  cannot fully afford  tuition fee but will assist and they are willing to assist with the little they are getting in order to promote this system
20/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 377 6533: This message was deleted
20/12/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Indeed and I do understand, Pauseland.
20/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: May I know what has been their budget for your higher education?
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay they are under budget but are subsidiary farmers , they grow crops for resale and  a part of my mom's salary  and the little that they both get is saved for my  higher education with high hopes that they will get helped
20/12/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, I understand.

So what exactly is their budget for your higher education, Pauseland?
20/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 78 588 0702: This message was deleted
20/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Their budget for my next term tuition fee is 40 USD and 20 for stationery
20/12/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright, however I am referring for your higher education after A level, Pauseland!

What's the financial planning for that?
20/12/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 588 0702: approximately 300 USD for tuition fee, living expenses and everything
20/12/23, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: Received please
20/12/23, 6:21 pm - Harmehak: Pauseland, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
20/12/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
20/12/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared document as well.
21/12/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 588 0702: Good morning l apologise for being offline recently. I am currently in rural areas and there is poor network connectivity
21/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 588 0702: Okay
21/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 588 0702: Yes we can start
21/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: I do understand please
21/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: So did you go through the shared document, Pauseland?
21/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 588 0702: Yes l did
21/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
3. Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you?
21/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 78 588 0702: Okay 
1. The Edoofa program is  a scholarship program that is helping meritorious and determined students for their higher education while studying abroad. It's not a charitable organization but accepts deserving and disciplined  students.

2. About the financial aspect of the program, this program will be providing a 50% or 100% scholarship depending on which one the student got . And there is an earn while you learn program that will compensate the students effort not through giving him or her cash but through paying part of school fees. With help of this program the average cost of education will range from 2000 - 3000 per year 

3. Yes l will need financial support, and my family members are willing to support me
21/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: I can see you thoroughly read the document and you have a better understanding, Pauseland!

Did you happen to discuss everything with your parents too?
21/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 588 0702: Yes and we will do more discussion so that they also fully understand it
21/12/23, 11:02 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

What all did you discuss in detail and what were their queries?
21/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 588 0702: We discussed about the ranges of tuition fee abroad and it's better than higher education in Zimbabwe, about the earn while you learn program that provide chances of paying part of the fees , about them helping and they are willing to help.

 There is a  question about the A level points that will be needed
21/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 588 0702: How many points must a student have
21/12/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: I am glad you had a detailed discussion!
21/12/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
21/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 588 0702: Okay l understand and l am confident
21/12/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: Anything else that you would like to ask, Pauseland?
21/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 588 0702: No there is nothing else. Everything is well explained
21/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
21/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: So who would be the one supporting you financially and what is their financial plan for your higher education in India, Pauseland?
21/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 588 0702: my mother will be the one . With the little that she gets from her salary and with that from farming it's approximately 300 USD for my higher education.
21/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 588 0702: But they will continue saving
21/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Pauseland!
21/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Pauseland, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
21/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
21/12/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Saturday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay
21/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 588 0702: It's good , understandable and appreciated
21/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 588 0702: Okay noted with thanks .l will be online
23/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?

23/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Alright, please.
23/12/23, 11:05 am - Harmehak: I believe you must have understood regarding the finances.

So are your parents willing to support you with roughly $1000 a year?
23/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 588 0702: Yes I understood and my parents too. They are willing to support me with roughly a $1000
23/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: I appreciate,

However you expressed their budget to be $300,

So what is their financial planning to support you?
23/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 588 0702: Yes their budget is $300 but while l am finishing my A level they will be continuing with saving more money 


They will continue with selling drought resistant crops and as my mother is a nurse aide she will also save whatever she gets from her salary
23/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.

Can they acknowledge their financial and mental support for your higher education in India using a voice note?
23/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 588 0702: Okay they will use Voice note
23/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Kindly request them to answer in that case please.
23/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Since we celebrate Christmas on Monday, *Hence, We will now connect on Tuesday at 9:30 AM CAT*. Please be online during your session time!
