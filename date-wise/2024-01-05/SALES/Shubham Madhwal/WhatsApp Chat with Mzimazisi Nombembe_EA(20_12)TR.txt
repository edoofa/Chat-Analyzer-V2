26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
26/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Yes its quite challenging for them
26/12/23, 5:33 pm - Tushti: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you  again at *09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

27/12/23, 9:23 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
27/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 634 2169: Good morning
27/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 634 2169: Yes we can start
27/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 693 3511: Good morning Ms Tushti
27/12/23, 10:26 am - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
27/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 693 3511: We have a  poultry project that supplements the  salary.
27/12/23, 10:40 am - Tushti: Would the family be able to raise around $2000 per year for the tuition fee?
27/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 634 2169: Even though they are struggling to raise our school fees, one or the other they would manage to get through. They kero some chickens and sell to supplement their earnings. With the fees needed for higher education , well it depends with the amounts rquired
27/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 693 3511: Truly speaking anything above $1200 will unaffordable looking at the current situation.
27/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 693 3511: If we put aside $100 aside every month it's much affordable.
27/12/23, 11:00 am - Tushti: Well, is there anyone in the family who can provide financial assistance for the remaining part of the fee?
27/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 693 3511: I wish there was.  If our elder children were employed definitely we would manage to pour in together to raise the whole amount.  But currently we don't have anyone reliable to assist
27/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: In that case, do you wish to withdraw this application?
27/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 693 3511: No. We don't wish to withdraw Mam. Attaining a scholarship for our son due to financial constraints had always been our wish.
27/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 693 3511: I'm kindly asking if you could adjust the required top_up amount if possible.
27/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 693 3511: ...to a figure that is lower than 2000usd.
27/12/23, 2:04 pm - Tushti: WE do have the EWYLProgram that helps the student self sponsor their education
27/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Okay Mam. How does this one work?
27/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Oh I have just checked on the EWYLProgram. If it's possible for our son to work and raise the remaining $800  while he learns we would really appreciate
27/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 634 2169: I would love to learn and work to reduce a burden from my parents
27/12/23, 3:07 pm - Tushti: However, if the student is unable to earn the amount, the family would have to pay
27/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Its alright. In that case we will have to go beyond our means. What we don't want is our son to lose this opportunity
27/12/23, 5:48 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Noted with thanks

28/12/23, 11:20 am - Tushti: Noted
28/12/23, 11:21 am - Tushti: Dear, I can see you have  a D in chemistry, I hope you shall get better grades in U6, since your scholarship percentage depends on it
28/12/23, 11:21 am - Tushti: Now, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
28/12/23, 11:21 am - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
28/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 634 2169: That's my hope too
28/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 634 2169: Noted
28/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 634 2169: I can see that without Physics l can no longer take the course in medicine. I'll update you on which course I'll decide on in a few
28/12/23, 11:44 am - Tushti: Please choose a course from this list
28/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 634 2169: I've done some research and I've decided to take a course in Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy
28/12/23, 12:13 pm - Tushti: Noted
28/12/23, 12:14 pm - Tushti: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
28/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Noted thank you for the information
28/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Thank you for the information
28/12/23, 12:28 pm - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
28/12/23, 12:28 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
28/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Physiotherapy is an essential component in the daily lives of people. Patients with a range of disabilities, stress related conditions as well as diseases related to spine depend on Physiotherapists.  As a prospective student in Physiotherapy, l have goals. In 5 years time, l see myself continuing in Physiotherapy and advancing in the career. By that time I hope to have attained the necessary physiotherapeutic skills to assist people mentioned earlier. Edoofa Program would not only enable me to attain an overseas degree, but it will also shape me into a professional that is able to assist his family and plant back into the community.
28/12/23, 3:04 pm - Tushti: That is really great, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
28/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 634 2169: I promise you that
28/12/23, 3:37 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 634 2169: India is known best for producing highest health care personnel and l would like to be an academic product of India.
28/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: That is correct
28/12/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

28/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Wow!
28/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Wow, this is all amazing and l would not want to miss the opportunity to be in such a democratic country with the 2nd largest number of scientists. Really, l would like to be mentored by such great minds.
28/12/23, 4:09 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
28/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Yes we are, it is expensive
28/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Oh yes we know. Ordinary people like us wouldn't manage to send our son to any international university without any financial assistance from well wishers like the Edoofa Program.
28/12/23, 4:16 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/12/23, 4:16 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/12/23, 4:18 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 4:18 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 4:18 pm - Tushti: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Edoofa is indeed helpful to many.
28/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Really India is a home for 'Education for All'. It's education system is all-inclusive. I appreciate the work done by the Edoofa to make education accessible to everyone.
28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: Let me now brief you about the EWYL Program
28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
28/12/23, 5:08 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Oh sorry we had a network problem till now
29/12/23, 8:31 am - +263 77 634 2169: Good morning
29/12/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 634 2169: From the above, Edoofa is really doing everything in it's power to assist us in releasing  the financial pressure on our parents. This is actually more than we hoped for.
29/12/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 693 3511: Good morning
29/12/23, 9:36 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
29/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Am sorry for the delay there seems to be a network problem. 
Yes we may begin
29/12/23, 12:45 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that *you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.*

Are you ready?
29/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Yes we are
29/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Okay, we are ready
29/12/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: Now, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 634 2169: That's between 1500-2250
29/12/23, 12:54 pm - Tushti: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/12/23, 12:54 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 12:54 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/12/23, 12:54 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Affirmative
29/12/23, 12:59 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/12/23, 12:59 pm - Tushti: So, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
29/12/23, 12:59 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
29/12/23, 12:59 pm - Tushti: Are you able to understand?
29/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Yes am following
29/12/23, 1:06 pm - Tushti: What about your parent?
29/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Am present and yes l understand
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Noted
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Okay
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 693 3511: No questions here, we can move on.
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *on 2nd Jnauary at 2 pm* Mr Shubham would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

02/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 693 3511: Good morning . I would to confirm that we have finally decided to withdraw the application.  Thank you. Good day
02/01/24, 11:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Mzimazisi and Mrs Nombembe  @263776342169 @263776933511 

I am Mr Shubham, Senior Academician at Edoofa

I have been evaluating your responses in the counselling session with your counsellor.

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
02/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Good morning . I would to confirm that we have finally decided to withdraw the application.  Thank you. Good day
02/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Good morning. I would like to inform you that we, as a family, have decided to withdraw the application for the Edoofa Scholarship. Sorry for the inconvenience and time wasted. Good day.
02/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Kindly refer to correspondences done earlier
02/01/24, 12:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please can yu help me understand the issues you are facing?
02/01/24, 4:51 pm - +263 77 693 3511: We are realising we will not be able to raise the finances needed.  We wish to have our son do a degree abroad but the reality is that we won't be able to raise the % needed for tuition, visa fees as well as the airfare. Thank you for taking us through.
02/01/24, 5:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I understand please
02/01/24, 5:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Our Academician Mr Piyush visited Zimbabwe in the month of March this year for around 70 days to conduct various workshops for the students regarding the Edoofa Program, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly $1100 is spent on just food while the cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, and travelling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/01/24, 5:09 pm - +263 77 693 3511: May be I'm not sure of now.  But my experience with my elder daughter's tertiary education our budget was less than that.
02/01/24, 5:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: And may I know what was her budget. So that I can help you understand better?
02/01/24, 5:25 pm - +263 77 693 3511: She was paying $$1080 /year. She stayed at home. Had transport cost of $20usd a month x 10months and that's $200. Once a student is enwith a university, she/he gets free internet as long as he/she's paid up
02/01/24, 5:28 pm - +263 77 693 3511: $540x2 semesters=$1080+$200= $1280. Plus a pocket money.. in all it never goes beyond $1500. Of course there are expensive universities... but parents choose what they can afford
02/01/24, 5:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: And in which year did she complete her education please?
02/01/24, 5:45 pm - +263 77 693 3511: That was in 2021
02/01/24, 5:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted @263776933511, I would like to know if you are aware of the term Inflation Rate Mrs Nombembe?
02/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Definitely I do. Even though Things are going up this side.  our salaries hardly increase. Beside sir, we've got an o level student , our young daughter,  who's suppose to sit for her final exams . She needs examination fees. That's too much for us.
02/01/24, 5:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, if you roughly calculate, Then fees in today's time for the same university in which Mzimazisi elder sibling studied at will be around $2500 and above, Wouldn't you agree?
02/01/24, 6:34 pm - +263 77 693 3511: I'm not sure. I'm yet to find out
02/01/24, 6:37 pm - +263 77 693 3511: So what about  my son who wishes to take physiotherapy,  what will be the total cost of everything included (eg. Visa fees, airfare, food, accommodation,  transport,  internet costs etc) without any hidden costs.
02/01/24, 6:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please the cost would range between $2000-$3000, Which is cheaper then the studying a good university in Zimbabwee
03/01/24, 9:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Mzimazisi and Mrs Nombembe  @263776342169 @263776933511, How are you?
03/01/24, 6:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.
