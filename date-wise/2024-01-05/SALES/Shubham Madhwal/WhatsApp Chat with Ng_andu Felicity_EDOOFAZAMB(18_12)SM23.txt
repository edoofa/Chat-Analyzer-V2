22/12/23, 2:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
22/12/23, 2:59 pm - +260 763007542: Because I carried a research and india was one of the best countries offering medical sciences in the globe
22/12/23, 3:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
22/12/23, 3:10 pm - +260 763007542: Just made a research and did not apply to any university
22/12/23, 3:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So can you share by what did you understand from your research?
22/12/23, 3:18 pm - +260 763007542: That india offer's quality education and their research is taken seriously producing the well trained individuals

22/12/23, 3:32 pm - +260 763007542: All around the globe
22/12/23, 3:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
22/12/23, 3:40 pm - +260 763007542: No I have no information about the cost of the studies there
22/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
22/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
22/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
22/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 4:37 pm - +260 763007542: Noted sir
22/12/23, 4:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*

Before moving on ahead, Do you have any questions regarding the information shared with you so far?
22/12/23, 5:59 pm - +260 763007542: No sir
22/12/23, 6:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief you about the Earn While You Learn Prorgam?
22/12/23, 6:01 pm - +260 763007542: Yes please
22/12/23, 6:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
22/12/23, 6:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/12/23, 6:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/12/23, 6:05 pm - +260 763007542: Noted sir
22/12/23, 6:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

22/12/23, 6:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
22/12/23, 6:20 pm - +260 763007542: As you do you earn as you learn program do you do something related to your course or something that you are personally interested in?

22/12/23, 6:43 pm - +260 763007542: Like what time do you get to work to earn credits points
22/12/23, 6:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please the working hours is totally flexible according to your schedule basically we want a student to focus more on their academics as well Hence we have kept the working as for the earn while you learn program totally according to the student schedule
22/12/23, 6:45 pm - +260 763007542: Noted sir
22/12/23, 6:51 pm - +260 763007542: Here as you mentioned earlier today is it that when the $2000 or $3000 is paid the Edoofa program finds a place for the student to stay and that place has a place to get food prepared for them or they prepare on their own
22/12/23, 6:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I did not get your question. Can you elaborate?
22/12/23, 6:56 pm - +260 763007542: You mentioned earlier on that when the fee of either $2000 or $3000 is paid 
Is it that the Edoofa program helps finding students a place to stay and food to eat because you said everything like food and accomodations and other university fees
22/12/23, 6:57 pm - +260 763007542: Will be covered in the same amount
22/12/23, 6:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Felicity please you would be residing in the University campus itself

22/12/23, 7:00 pm - +260 763007542: Thank you so much
23/12/23, 9:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
23/12/23, 9:44 am - +260 763007542: Yes please
23/12/23, 9:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 9:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
23/12/23, 9:54 am - +260 763007542: These are the stages that one undergoes in the Edoofa program to reach into studying in india
23/12/23, 10:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
23/12/23, 10:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/12/23, 10:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
23/12/23, 10:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
23/12/23, 10:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
23/12/23, 10:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/12/23, 10:13 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/12/23, 10:19 am - +260 763007542: Noted sir
23/12/23, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
23/12/23, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
23/12/23, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
23/12/23, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
23/12/23, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
23/12/23, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
23/12/23, 11:59 am - +260 763007542: The affordability of the studies and the earn as you learn program
23/12/23, 12:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
23/12/23, 12:18 pm - +260 763007542: No it is an interesting discovery I have found out
23/12/23, 12:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
23/12/23, 12:21 pm - +260 763007542: So when is student supposed to pay the enrollment fee
23/12/23, 12:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
23/12/23, 12:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 12:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
23/12/23, 12:34 pm - +260 763007542: Alright sir 
Understood
23/12/23, 12:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
23/12/23, 12:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).
23/12/23, 12:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
23/12/23, 12:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/12/23, 12:47 pm - +260 763007542: Understood sir
23/12/23, 12:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.

We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
23/12/23, 12:51 pm - +260 763007542: Understood sir

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s.

Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Life in Rwanda after the genocide Ronda has been one of the first going countries and making exactly 20 years after the genocide there's some problems that have affected render after the genocide and some of the problems that I'm going to discuss below inflation there's been inflation in the country render because of what happened 20 years ago The killing of 1 million people in 100 days.
Hi unemployment there's high unemployment in Rwanda because people have not been able to find jobs and they have not been able to be educated because they have been lack of infrastructure so this is because people not to have money to support themselves they live in unsanitary slumbswhich has caused the people to be seek and die.
There has been underdevelopment in Rwanda because people are still living in despair knowing that this genocide can come back and any time and their restricted in their movements because they are scared that this genocide might come back again in their country.
The random government have not given up on their country they have actually made it better and they have increased their economy 8% each year making it the first growing country in Africa Rwanda is now doing its best and putting in measures for the people to to be the  reassured that they they are in safe hands.
Government has not given up on its country so it has ventured into businesses like to a resume of the mountains and the country scenery that has brought more money for the stability of the country so they can rebuke their infrastructure and continue the schooling of the children and employing more people the devastated country has not given up it has gotten aid bilateral and my murtateral aid from the neighboring countries.
