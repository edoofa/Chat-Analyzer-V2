I learnt that Edoofa can help me get my degree at the same time working.I also learnt I can help other individuals get a scholarship from Edoofa .Edoofa can give me tasks which will benefit my scholarship until I get a fully funded one .On completion  of my desirable degree ,Edoofa can help me get a job.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?      I believe change starts with me and I also believe that Edoofa can offer me an opportunity to change my life and the future as I want to improve the shortages of urologists in the world .I also believe that Edoofa can give me an opportunity because I am very committed and I easily interact with other people from different backgrounds and different parts of the world .

02/01/24, 7:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so Molline, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions. <This message was edited>

03/01/24, 10:54 pm - +263 78 580 3260: Good evening ,I am pretty sure you've been thinking why I even applied for edoofa knowing very well I don't have anytime who will find my fees.The thing is I grew up in a household where we prayed and faith one of the biggest things I've grasped,so applying when I knew I needed to also pay for the registration as Rufaro mentioned the amounts to me .I just td myself that I was going to apply even if I don't have any money tomoay for the university I get into .e I added my father beacuse you asked for a parent but he actually called me saying why I added him in here that is why he hasn't been participating because he doesn't believe in me going to university .He doesn't even recognize me anymore .Ever since I lost my mother I'm 1010.He abandoned me and remarried .I don't even stay with him..Its been 4years now wiithout seeing him but yet he comes to Zimbabwe  sometimes.

MY SINCERE APOLOGIES IF I SEEMEED TO HAVE WASTED TIME AND RESOURCES WHEN YOU  CONTACTED ME.My belief is just too much that is why and I am very sorry for any inconviences but I was looking forward to get help with Education for  all
