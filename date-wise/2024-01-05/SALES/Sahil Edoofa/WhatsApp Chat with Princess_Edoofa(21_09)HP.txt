22/09/23, 12:28 pm - +27 73 712 6490: What l haven't under stand is the accommodation  and u going to provide with even transport fee
22/09/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Mr Moyo, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 3000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/09/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
22/09/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/09/23, 1:00 pm - +27 73 712 6490: Ok l understand
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
22/09/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Moyo, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mrs Moyo better as parents to Princess. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
22/09/23, 2:36 pm - +27 73 712 6490: <Media omitted>

25/09/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful, please!
25/09/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
25/09/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 322 1348: Alright
25/09/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I believe Princess is an A level student studying Commercials at Minda High school please?

28/09/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
28/09/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
28/09/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Yes
28/09/23, 6:11 pm - Harmehak: Could you please share the same with me as well?
28/09/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Which one?
28/09/23, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: Regarding the cost of education please!
28/09/23, 6:21 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Alright  Iwant Princess to go and study in India
28/09/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
28/09/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: However, now let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/09/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Alright
28/09/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/09/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/09/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 6:31 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Alright it's okay
28/09/23, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, Mrs Moyo, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/09/23, 6:35 pm - +263 71 322 1348: May I ask this question
If Princess  has gone for this period of  her University 
Where will she be employed ?
28/09/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: Well Mrs Moyo, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
28/09/23, 6:36 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Alright
28/09/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: So Mrs Moyo, did you go through the same and understand that there's an Earn While You Learn Program as well?
28/09/23, 6:39 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Yes
28/09/23, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

Lets discuss the same in detail and how it would help you and Princess!
28/09/23, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/09/23, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/09/23, 6:43 pm - +263 71 322 1348: To get her job easily  we as a family will be much happier  for our child
28/09/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
28/09/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: Under the Earn While You Learn Program she would earn credits which are equivalent to cash

And learn skills required for job sector.
28/09/23, 6:45 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Okay
28/09/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Yes
28/09/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:
28/09/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 322 1348: That's great
28/09/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

28/09/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
28/09/23, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/09/23, 6:50 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Alright
28/09/23, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/09/23, 6:55 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Good
28/09/23, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Moyo, so far do you have any queries please?
28/09/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 322 1348: No
28/09/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. We would conclude the discussion in 20 minutes!
28/09/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Moyo, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
28/09/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Moyo now, *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/09/23, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Good evening Mrs Moyo!

How are you doing today?
29/09/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Am alright
29/09/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far please?
29/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Yes
29/09/23, 9:42 pm - Harmehak: Kindly address the same in that case.
29/09/23, 10:36 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Can't understand here
30/09/23, 1:47 am - Harmehak: The calculation refers to how much a student spends just on application without Edoofa please.
30/09/23, 4:21 am - +263 71 322 1348: Alright
30/09/23, 5:23 am - Harmehak: You would agree that it would be $1500-$2250, Mrs Moyo?
30/09/23, 9:12 am - Harmehak: Good morning Mrs Moyo, hope you are doing well!
02/10/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: Greetings, I hope this message finds you well.

*I will now connect with you for the upcoming session on tomorrow, at 9:30 AM CAT*, where I will provide you with valuable insights into the Edoofa Scholarship program. Since it was weekend and on Monday, October 2nd, 2023, We celebrated Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday here in India, our offices were closed in observance of the special day. 

Hence I kindly request you to prepare any questions or topics you'd like to discuss during the session.
02/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Alright
03/10/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Yes, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Alright
03/10/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Mrs, Moyo Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
03/10/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
03/10/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Alright
03/10/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
03/10/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
03/10/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: Are you following the discussion Mr Moyo?

@27737126490
03/10/23, 5:18 pm - +27 73 712 6490: Yes pls
03/10/23, 5:18 pm - +27 73 712 6490: We are together
03/10/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, Mr Moyo!

Do connect with Mrs Ruth.
03/10/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
03/10/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).
03/10/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
03/10/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
03/10/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
03/10/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

03/10/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.

13/10/23, 10:41 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
14/10/23, 11:27 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

20/10/23, 10:11 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greetings to you 
How are you doing today?

21/10/23, 11:04 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
22/10/23, 4:59 am - +263 71 322 1348: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 8:02 am - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/10/23, 8:02 am - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/10/23, 8:02 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 8:02 am - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
22/10/23, 8:02 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 8:03 am - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28th October 2023 for $200 and the 27th or 28th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th  of October 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

I have been actively involved in evaluating your application since the beginning of your sessions with our dedicated counselor. I must express my admiration for your commitment to supporting your child's higher education, a sentiment echoed not only in your application but also in the positive feedback received from your school authorities.

Having closely followed your journey, I am pleased to inform you that your interview was impressive, and I personally advocated for your selection during discussions with the Academic Board. Your dedication and enthusiasm have played a significant role in securing your eligibility for the scholarship. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 11:03 am - Sahil Edoofa: Heartiest congratulations to you and your family, *Mr.Moyo and Mrs.Moyo as Princess Amanda Moyo’s* application was found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I have been so happy and excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage 👏🏽👏🏽.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same? <This message was edited>

How are you doing today?

18/12/23, 7:19 pm - +263 71 322 1348: We are fine
18/12/23, 8:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
18/12/23, 8:12 pm - +263 71 322 1348: Yes
18/12/23, 8:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
18/12/23, 8:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

04/01/24, 10:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Greetings

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
