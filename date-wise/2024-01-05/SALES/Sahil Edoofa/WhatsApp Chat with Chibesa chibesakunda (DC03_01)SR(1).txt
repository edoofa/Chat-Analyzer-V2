Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/01/24, 12:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.
After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.*

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.
