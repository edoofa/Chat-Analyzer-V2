08/11/23, 5:46 pm - +27 73 119 2604: Scholarship is not a distributed charity from what I understand, it is given to the deserving students.

The aim of Edoofa is to help deserving students to further their studies and also their career, this scholarship will continue if the student in which it is given to continues to have a positive attitude.

There is a 50% to 100% tuition fee and there are 1500 seats that are booked for African students in india.

After being qualified as a deserving student at Edoofa, they will send a letter of mine to different universities, this is after the interview with the director

The university that I will be enrolled into a university, that particular university will help me for the visa application by sending the admission letter and throughout this process the Edoofa program will give me an hand

As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
19/12/23, 12:59 pm - +27 60 341 3656: No I'm not familiar with it can you please share it with me if possible
19/12/23, 1:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: -**let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

19/12/23, 3:13 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I have taken note of it
19/12/23, 3:13 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Yes it is
19/12/23, 3:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Interesting
Yes I read a little on the pdf that you sent to me, can you please break it down for me so that I can understand better
19/12/23, 4:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What all you know about Earn while you learn program?
19/12/23, 4:35 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I know that it is a program that will enable me to work on online projects and whatever I will earn will complete on my scholarship and it is not in a form of cash

19/12/23, 4:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
19/12/23, 4:47 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Yes I think so
20/12/23, 11:42 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
Shall we start today's session?
20/12/23, 12:52 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Good afternoon sir,yes we may start
20/12/23, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents answer this ?
20/12/23, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now , if I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
20/12/23, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Now you see , the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
20/12/23, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
20/12/23, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is *consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects* is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

20/12/23, 4:02 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I have taken note of it
20/12/23, 4:02 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I appreciate
20/12/23, 4:03 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Fair
20/12/23, 4:03 pm - +27 60 341 3656: They will answer once they are available
20/12/23, 4:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:08 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Yes Very interesting
20/12/23, 4:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
20/12/23, 4:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
20/12/23, 4:17 pm - +27 60 341 3656: The prefer the first point however I also like third one
20/12/23, 4:18 pm - +27 60 341 3656: "I" i meant
20/12/23, 4:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now let me brief you on another benefit of the Edoofa Program.
As you know through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. But did you know that here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees as well.
 
Would you like me to explain how that happens?
20/12/23, 4:25 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Yes please
20/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright so can you tell me what is the first thing you would be supposed to do when you wish to apply for a university
 
You buy an application form by paying the application fee, isn't it?
20/12/23, 4:29 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Correct
20/12/23, 4:32 pm - +27 60 341 3656: We fill in the application form which involves paying the application fee
20/12/23, 5:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you know how much the application fee is for an international student for any college on your own?
20/12/23, 6:29 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I don't really don't know
20/12/23, 6:29 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I don't really know I meant
20/12/23, 6:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well,if you research you will find that on an average Application Fee of a University is around $150-$200.So if you want to apply for 5 different colleges, you will have to pay the application fee for each college differently.So how much will the total expense be on just the application fee?
20/12/23, 6:42 pm - +27 60 341 3656: For 5 different colleges it will be $750-$1000
20/12/23, 6:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: it would be around $750-$1000 but even if you apply to 5 colleges after paying the application fee, do they provide you any assurance whether you will be given admission or scholarship?
20/12/23, 6:46 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I don't think so, that fee is for the process of application
20/12/23, 6:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Exactly and do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
 
But the real challenge is to get eligible. Do you think you are capable of this challenge?
20/12/23, 6:52 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Yes of course
20/12/23, 6:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same.
Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
20/12/23, 6:55 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I am not familiar with it please tell me about it if possible
20/12/23, 6:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.

 
This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!
 
So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it.
Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
20/12/23, 7:00 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Thank you,I understand its purpose
20/12/23, 7:00 pm - +27 60 341 3656: And its importance as well
20/12/23, 7:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
 How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
20/12/23, 7:07 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Quite a lot
$1350-$2000 in total
20/12/23, 7:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000. 

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
20/12/23, 7:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:19 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Oh I okay then
20/12/23, 7:19 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Very interesting
20/12/23, 7:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
21/12/23, 11:42 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
21/12/23, 2:34 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Good afternoon sir, I'm doing well
21/12/23, 2:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: so now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
21/12/23, 2:45 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I understand that Edoofa has facilitated parents by allowing them to pay $200 in 7 days and the rest which is $150 within the next 30 days instead of paying the full amount which is $350 in a week and also the EWYL enables the students to earn in order to reduce the cost of education
21/12/23, 2:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: and annual cost ?
21/12/23, 2:54 pm - +27 60 341 3656: This message was deleted
21/12/23, 3:04 pm - +27 60 341 3656: $2000-$3000
21/12/23, 3:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
21/12/23, 4:23 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Thank you
22/12/23, 11:40 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
22/12/23, 3:25 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Good afternoon sir I'm okay thanks for asking
22/12/23, 3:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 3:43 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Phase 1 I guess
22/12/23, 3:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
22/12/23, 4:49 pm - +27 60 341 3656: Yes please
22/12/23, 5:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
22/12/23, 8:19 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I have taken note of that
22/12/23, 8:24 pm - +27 60 341 3656: I have a clear understanding of this
22/12/23, 8:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your child’s counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
22/12/23, 8:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
