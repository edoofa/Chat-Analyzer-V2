11/10/23, 1:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Primrose!
A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session
Are you ready for it?
11/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Greeting to you, yes I am ready
11/10/23, 1:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: First thing first, *_Congratulations_* ✨
On being awarded the Edoofa scholarship, *Primrose*! This is a fantastic opportunity to expand your horizons, gain new experiences, and make memories that will last a lifetime.
You should feel proud of this achievement, as it is a testament to your hard work, dedication, and determination.
This scholarship is an opportunity for you to grow as an individual, learn about new cultures and ways of life, and achieve your dreams.
All the best!
11/10/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 
I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
I am dropping a video that will help you know me a little better. 
In case you face any problems while viewing the video, please let me know.
11/10/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 305 0093: our network this side is poor so downloading might ake some time
11/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Thank you I have managed to listen to vedio
11/10/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: you are welcome please1
11/10/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, you are already aware of the EWYL Program. If so, can you provide me with some information about it?
So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I am not yet aware.of the finer details of EWYL. however i was made to understand that its all about giving an opportunity to the child to gain work experience while working. This makes her chances of employability high. That is giving her opportunity for internship, volonteering in credible organisations. If she works hard in this area she will earn credits which would increase the percentage of her scholarship
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Primrose* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I am following
11/10/23, 4:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Primrose* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
11/10/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Primrose* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
11/10/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I have gone through it and now appreciate what the founder will be sharing
12/10/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Warm Greetings!
It brings me great joy to welcome you to today's scheduled session. 

Let's make the most of this time and engage in meaningful discussions.
So, are you ready for today’s session?
13/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I can see my network is bad
13/10/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for letting me know about this. It is alright.
13/10/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Primrose*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Primrose* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
13/10/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Primrose* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
13/10/23, 3:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/10/23, 3:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 3:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Is everything clear until now?*
13/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Yes everything is clear let me go through the documents you shared
13/10/23, 3:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: okay
13/10/23, 3:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Primrose* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Primrose* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
13/10/23, 3:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
13/10/23, 3:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Please choose a batch for the sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
13/10/23, 3:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In the sessions (that will be happening on the days chosen), the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter will be discussed.
13/10/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *THIRD*- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
Edoofa EWYL (contact):  +91 98107 89170


*FOURTH*- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say '*Greetings, Ms. Sharda, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'*


*FIFTH* -Once the sessions are resumed then  Every day *Primrose*  have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
13/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 305 0093: There are a few areas which I need further explanation. First, your prosective student Primrose as I said from the start is at school and does not have an access to a device, so isn't she being left behind?
13/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Also since on both Monday and Thursdays I will be at work, is it possible to schedule these lessons after working hours
13/10/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I can completely understand your concern dear parent. Since, Primrose is in school, we have decided to only take the basic training wih you and then we can put her program on hold.
13/10/23, 3:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: And let me tell you that Primrose will not miss out on any learning. 
I will ensure that I start her discussions exactly from I left off.
13/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Thank you very much
18/10/23, 2:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Primrose
I hope you are doing really well.

I am aware of the ongoing examination, and I wish you all the very best for the same. 
I would like to remind you that I have already shared the  procedure through which we will be able to put your EWYL Program on hold and then we will resume it once your examinations will get over.

19/10/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want *you* to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.

Thank you so much sharing the screenshot of the email sent.
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Primrose and parents! 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Good afternoon. Its my first time to here about this festival. If your time permits, you can shed more light thank you?
26/10/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Sure Primrose, Let me tell you more about the festival.
26/10/23, 4:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Certainly! Dussehra is a big Indian festival that's all about good defeating evil. It celebrates the victory of a prince named Rama over a demon king called Ravana. Rama rescued his wife Sita with the help of his friends and a special bow. People light up fireworks and have parades to mark this happy day.

But Dussehra is not just about a story; it's also a time for family, fun, and food. People dress up in colorful clothes, visit fairs, and enjoy yummy sweets. They also exchange gifts and greetings. The festival lasts for ten days, and on the final day, giant effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna, and son Meghnad are burned with fireworks, symbolizing the victory of good over evil in a grand way.

And the best part? Dussehra teaches us some important life lessons. It reminds us that no matter how powerful evil may seem, goodness and truth always win in the end. It encourages us to be brave and stand up against injustice. The festival also promotes unity and togetherness as people from different backgrounds come together to celebrate. It's a time to forgive and forget, mending relationships and starting anew.

So, it's like a mix of a thrilling story, delicious treats, and lots of celebrations, all while sharing meaningful messages about courage, unity, and the triumph of good values in life. 🌟🤝🕊️🎆🎁🍬
26/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Well understood. Its a wonderful day on your calendar.
26/10/23, 4:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words!
27/10/23, 12:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon
I hope you are doing well

It is completely alright.
27/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Afternoon Ms Sharda how is the weather like in India. This side its tooo hot, in some areas temperatures are rising to 40 degrees
27/10/23, 2:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It was hot in here too. But it's the beginning of winters here in India.
31/10/23, 5:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Primrose

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.
31/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Greetings Mrs Sharda. Primrose is currently locked  up in her exams. I think it will be in the best of her interest if we wait for her to respond to this question.
31/10/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 305 0093: However I will try to get in touch with her teachers so that she has access to a device to be able to respond

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

07/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I think to succeed in EWYL, you need self motivation and dedication to every given task
07/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Absolutely, your insight is spot on. Self-motivation and unwavering dedication are key ingredients for success in Earn While You Learn. They drive you to excel in your tasks and make the most of this valuable opportunity. Keep up the great work!
17/11/23, 10:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings to Primrose and parents! 
Hope you are doing well.

*Let's kick things off with a motivational quote from the legendary Warren Buffett:*

This quote underscores the profound importance of self-development and personal growth. Buffett emphasizes that the most valuable asset you possess is yourself. By investing time, effort, and resources in your education, skills, and well-being, you lay the foundation for future success.

So, let's use today's session as an opportunity to explore how we can invest in ourselves, hone our skills, and empower each other on the journey towards success. Remember, the dividends of self-investment are boundless!

07/12/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
07/12/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
07/12/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"
Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
08/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 492 6174: Poem
08/12/23, 1:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.
For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.
So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.
08/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 492 6174: Okay ma'am

08/12/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations.
08/12/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
08/12/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

3. Surprise!! An Additional Opportunity to earn $25 worth of Scholarship Credits when 5 students complete their enrollment from one particular school!
08/12/23, 2:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
08/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 492 6174: Q1 Mukaro High School.
Well yes my school is connected to the Edoofa program one of senior ladies at school, Mrs Mapako is connected to Mr Abhinav...she is the one that aslo introduced the program to me and many other students as well
08/12/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/12/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

08/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 492 6174: Okay ma'am
08/12/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
08/12/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

08/12/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
