04/08/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I understand that your EWYL program has been put *on hold*. Can you kindly let me know the reason for the same?

I would appreciate it if you could share *when you will* you be able to resume our sessions?
 
I'm truly *looking forward* o embarking on this journey together, and *your presence is eagerly anticipated*.
15/09/23, 9:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takura

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 887 2725: evwning sir
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 887 2725: yeah i think its good that way
15/09/23, 9:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Can you choose what timings work for you?
15/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 887 2725: i think my parents will be able to attend at 2:00pm to 3:00 pm and i am alright with the time on saturday session
15/09/23, 9:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Takura Noted.
15/09/23, 9:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly text me five minutes prior to our session tomorrow.
15/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 887 2725: ok sir
15/09/23, 10:07 pm - +27 72 579 9668: That will work
19/09/23, 2:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, I hope you're doing well today. It's always a pleasure to connect with you for our sessions. 🌟
19/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 887 2725: afternoon sir
19/09/23, 2:28 pm - +27 72 579 9668: Fine sir we can continue
19/09/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/09/23, 2:54 pm - +27 72 579 9668: No l  don't understand
19/09/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Takura is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals. <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
21/09/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon 

Hope you are doing well!

It's a pleasure to have you join me for this scheduled session

22/09/23, 2:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
22/09/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
22/09/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
22/09/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Takura* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/09/23, 2:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Happy Monday*
I hope you are doing well

Are you ready for today's session?
26/09/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon 
I hope you are doing well

I have observed your inactivity for the scheduled session.
May I know what is the challenge exactly?
26/09/23, 2:43 pm - +27 72 579 9668: Fine and you
26/09/23, 2:43 pm - +27 72 579 9668: Sorry yesterday I wasn't available

27/09/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Esteemed Learner!
How are you?

Excuse me for yesterday. I had an important meeting.Are you ready for today's scheduled session?
27/09/23, 3:04 pm - +27 72 579 9668: Fine and you.  Today am bit busy
27/09/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Noted.
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon *Takura*
I hope you are doing well

Since your EWYL program has been put on hold due to your exams.
Can you let me know *when are your exams getting over so that we can resume our EWYL sessions?*
28/09/23, 2:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoom.
I hope you are doing really well.

  So, are you ready to start our session?
28/09/23, 2:10 pm - +27 72 579 9668: Yes, how are you today
28/09/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am doing good. Thank you so much for asking.
Before that, Kindly provide me an update on when will Takura's exams be getting over?
28/09/23, 2:38 pm - +27 72 579 9668: Let's him tell us
28/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay I will be waiting for it.
28/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Takura* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
28/09/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: -At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Takura*’S EWYL journey:
28/09/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Takura* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
28/09/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following the discussion?
29/09/23, 2:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Friday!

05/10/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Takura* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
05/10/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 2:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Takura* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits

2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency

3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Takura* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
05/10/23, 2:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

07/12/23, 2:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

07/12/23, 2:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.*  
Here is the message -
07/12/23, 2:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
