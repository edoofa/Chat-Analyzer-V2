_Through WhatsApp community groups_

Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
01/12/23, 11:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 982 1695: on it
01/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 982 1695: so if I get those students I should open up a group which includes them and you right
01/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 982 1695: or I'll just have to send the filled out application forms of those students
01/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 982 1695: I have gone through the audio file and I have understood that , I'll have to open a group and add you of which you won't be actively participating but you'll be assessing my progress.
01/12/23, 12:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done , I am impressed with your understanding.
01/12/23, 12:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
01/12/23, 12:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
01/12/23, 12:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
01/12/23, 12:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

01/12/23, 12:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
01/12/23, 12:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 12:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.

01/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes I am following
01/12/23, 12:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly share your understanding please.
01/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 982 1695: the network is poor ,it failed to open the audio
01/12/23, 12:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright Gugulethu, let me share the content in the written form then.
01/12/23, 12:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright, so let us talk about the last project which is the African school's education reform mission. This project is like our student's favorite project as it gives them an opportunity to make their teachers proud by telling them how lucky they are to qualify for the Edoofa program. As part of this project, you will reach out to local schools in your region and you will and headmasters and inform them about the Edoofa program.

So initially what you can do is you can make a list of all the higher secondary schools in your local area. You can start with your own school, connect with the principal of your school and you can tell them maybe over WhatsApp or a call about why you joined Edoofa in the first place. You can later tell them about how you have planned your future and then share the program details with them. After this, you could simply ask them if you would like to set up an online meeting with the Edoofa program director where both of them can explore synergies.

 After this, you can then share the contact details of the principal with your EWYL mentor in the format that shall be provided to you. As you know that in this project you have to reach out to schools and arrange a meeting between the school headmaster and the Edoofa program director,

We have tried to come up with an Edoofa cover letter that you can use to initiate a conversation with your principal or headmaster. I shall now be sending it to you after this audio. Thank you and all the best on this project.
01/12/23, 12:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Gugulethu, are you there in the session?
01/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 982 1695: ok
01/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 982 1695: thank you
01/12/23, 2:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome.
01/12/23, 2:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:*
01/12/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
01/12/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

05/12/23, 10:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?

06/12/23, 8:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Good morning Gugulethu*
I hope you have had a great weekend.

You have a session scheduled today at *8:30 am*. Kindly confirm your availability for the same.
06/12/23, 8:32 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Let's kick things off with a motivational quote from the legendary Warren Buffett:*
*"The best investment you can make is in yourself."*

This quote underscores the profound importance of self-development and personal growth. Buffett emphasizes that the most valuable asset you possess is yourself. By investing time, effort, and resources in your education, skills, and well-being, you lay the foundation for future success.

So, let's use today's session as an opportunity to explore how we can invest in ourselves, hone our skills, and empower each other on the journey towards success. Remember, the dividends of self-investment are boundless!
06/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 78 982 1695: good morning, thanks for the quote
06/12/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please.
06/12/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
06/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 982 1695: yes from the previous audio I understood that I should create a WhatsApp group and then choose the students that are suited for the scholarship/ counseling session
06/12/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
06/12/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 982 1695: yes I am
06/12/23, 8:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
06/12/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 982 1695: okay
06/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 982 1695: so that's it
06/12/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: No
06/12/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Gugulethu, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*
06/12/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will help you out.
06/12/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All. EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations. This exceptional scholarship program addresses the challenges of affordability and employability in higher education through its unique work-study model.
06/12/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Additionally, EDOOFA's Earn While You Learn Program helps students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation by providing opportunities to learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
In Zimbabwe alone, EDOOFA has enrolled more than 1,500 students in the program within the last year. Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.
06/12/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.

4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(Ph.D.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
06/12/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you go through all the information, and see that this can be a million opportunities for your school, then please help me fill out the form so that the Program Director of Edoofa can contact you.
06/12/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: *School Details*:

06/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 982 1695: ok will do
06/12/23, 9:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
06/12/23, 9:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
