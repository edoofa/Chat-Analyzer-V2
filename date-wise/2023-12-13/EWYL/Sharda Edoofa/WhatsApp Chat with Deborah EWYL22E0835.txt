We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!

This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

01/12/23, 2:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright Deborah, if this is the concern then let me share the information in written form.
01/12/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: All the Edoofians have a great sense of community building. The term community building refers to the process of establishing and strengthening connections, relationships, and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community. This involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate, communicate and work toward common goals. The goal of community building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction, and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success.

 This shared belief is the core of our second project which is community building. The primary outcome of this project is for students to develop networking and persuasion skills and learn how to leverage social media to offer African students an opportunity to join Edoufian's educational ecosystem and acquire international education that prepares them for the future. By reaching out to personal and extended networks, students will identify motivated youths who are looking to create great careers and direct them toward this opportunity.

 This project also encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create an impact in the lives of others. To successfully complete this project, students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools, completed their secondary education, or are currently in the final year of senior secondary education. As a member of Team EDUFA, students will be expected to use their networking and persuasion skills to refer the students to the program and help the organization grow.

 Throughout the project, Edoofa will provide guidance and support to ensure that the students are successful in their efforts. The referral generation project for Edoofa provides students with the opportunity to earn scholarship credits by referring their personal and extended networks to the Edoofa program. For every student that enrolls and pays the first part of the enrollment fee, the referring student will receive $20 worth of scholarship credits. Upon completion of the admission formalities of the university,

The referring student will receive $30 worth of scholarship credits. In addition, there is an opportunity to earn an extra $5 worth of scholarship credits for every student that the Edoofa team connects with the referring student for clarification on the program.
01/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 372 2404: Community building project is about giving an opportunity to other students like me a chance to further their studies with Edoofa by making them aware that there is a scholarship program like Edoofa that could assist them further their studies.It also involves personal interaction with peers and to have a positive impact to them
01/12/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
01/12/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project. Are you ready?
01/12/23, 3:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, You have to share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they deserve to be Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

05/12/23, 1:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright Deborah.
05/12/23, 1:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
05/12/23, 1:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
05/12/23, 1:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
05/12/23, 1:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

07/12/23, 1:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Deborah.

As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:

Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room
Now, what does this mean to you?
Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.

So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.

Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
07/12/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.*

I would also like to understand the reason behind your absence.
08/12/23, 1:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Deborah
As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"
Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
08/12/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.*

How are you doing?

"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." - Helen Keller
This powerful quote by Helen Keller encapsulates the essence of collaboration and collective effort. It reminds us that our individual abilities may be limited, but when we unite and work together, our potential becomes boundless. Today, let's embrace the strength that lies in our unity and forge ahead towards shared success.
Let's make this session a testament to the incredible achievements possible when we join forces.

11/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 372 2404: am failing to download due to poor network
11/12/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright Deborah. Let me share the written understanding of the projects with you.
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright, so let us talk about the last project which is the African school's education reform mission. This project is like our student's favorite project as it gives them an opportunity to make their teachers proud by telling them how lucky they are to qualify for the Edoofa program. As part of this project, you will reach out to local schools in your region and you will and headmasters and inform them about the Edoofa program.

So initially what you can do is you can make a list of all the higher secondary schools in your local area. You can start with your own school, connect with the principal of your school and you can tell them maybe over WhatsApp or a call about why you joined Edoofa in the first place. You can later tell them about how you have planned your future and then share the program details with them. After this, you could simply ask them if you would like to set up an online meeting with the Edoofa program director where both of them can explore synergies.

 After this, you can then share the contact details of the principal with your EWYL mentor in the format that shall be provided to you. As you know that in this project you have to reach out to schools and arrange a meeting between the school headmaster and the Edoofa program director,

We have tried to come up with an Edoofa cover letter that you can use to initiate a conversation with your principal or headmaster. I shall now be sending it to you after this audio. Thank you and all the best on this project.
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
11/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 372 2404: this is all about educating other headmasters or principals about Edoofa program through my experience and my future plans and goals and after that l set up a meeting with Edoofa for them
11/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 372 2404: l understand
11/12/23, 2:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Deborah.
11/12/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

Q2. l will tell them about how Edoofa aims to make quality education affordable and how l got the schoolarship and also the benefits
Q3. Midlands province
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
11/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 372 2404: l am ready

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
11/12/23, 3:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Deborah, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
11/12/23, 3:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will help you out.

11/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 372 2404: okay l understand
11/12/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

11/12/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
11/12/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
