28/09/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Resuming our session I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Yes it sounds interesting
28/09/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

28/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Of course it is <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Brendon?
28/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Thanks, it sounds amazing
28/09/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

28/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Ready
28/09/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
28/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 080 1097: There is Ms Aditi my EWYL mentor and there is also Ms Sajana the head of the Department and there is also Ms Davi the head coach of the EWYL program. 
2. My mentor set three goals for me for my EWYL journey which follows:
- make sure that my academic journey is great 
-ensure that I'm given enough opportunity to self finance my higher education in India 
-to work towards attaining the objectives 
3.Mr Angad Singh ,the founder of Edoofa interact with all students through *Newsletters*
4  I think that The hall of inspiration is a section in the news latter where the founder mentions one of the Edoofians who could have done good

May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
09/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 080 1097: I think I'm not flexible in African school education reform. I have interests in Community building

09/10/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It's completely fine to have a strong interest in community building. However, while you may have a preference for community building, I would encourage you to consider the potential impact of the African school education reform project. It's a valuable initiative that can bring about positive changes and have a lasting influence on many students' lives.
09/10/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You can explore how to balance your commitment to community building while also contributing to the school reform project. Both endeavors can coexist and provide a well-rounded experience. Your flexibility in participating in both projects can broaden your horizons and enhance your skills.

09/10/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
09/10/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

09/10/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
09/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 080 1097: I think i will be able to do African school education reform after the exams.for the mean time I think i can manage community building

10/10/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
10/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Noted
10/10/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Tuesday and Friday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions

10/10/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 080 1097: Telling the truth. I don't think i will be able to continue with the EWYL lessons because next week i will be starting my final exams. And i need time to prepare
10/10/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
10/10/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com
