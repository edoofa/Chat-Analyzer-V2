24/08/23, 10:32 am - +260 97 7822958 joined using this group's invite link
24/08/23, 10:41 am - +260 97 7822958: Greetings.  This serves to advise that Maluba Kapaso is still in a boarding school and as such will will submit the Statement of Purpose (SOS) when he is back. As parents, we earlier submitted that SOS is better done by him. We are glad that our request was accepted.  We are grateful.
24/08/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Maluba and parents!
How are you?
24/08/23, 12:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want Maluba to have full focus on our sessions with me without compromising his time in school, it would be best if we could put our sessions on hold and resume them later when his school is over
24/08/23, 12:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing this solely because you mentioned the paucity of time he is facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
24/08/23, 12:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail on behalf of Maluba to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and Ms. Davi, Head Coach EWYL stating that:

Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because  __  from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com , and sharda.edoofa@gmail.com, and ewyl@edoofa.com 


Once done, please let me know.
24/08/23, 12:20 pm - +260 97 7822958: Well noted, we act as per you guidance.
29/08/23, 10:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Maluba and parents!
How are you?
29/08/23, 10:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: Have you shared the mail?
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 8:50 pm - +260 97 7822958: Greetings. We are grateful for the support this far. Maluba is at a boarding school away from us parents and he is only scheduled to come end at the end of November 2023. I will engage with yourselves tomorrow. Regards.
19/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

19/09/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Friday, till then have a great day!
22/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 12:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
22/09/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Tuesday in the coming week, till then have a great weekend!

I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

How are you?

May we begin with our session?
06/10/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've noticed that both Maluba and the parents haven't been available for the Fastrack sessions we had planned. I understand that life can be unpredictable, and there might be challenges you're facing that are affecting your availability. Could you please share the specific obstacles or constraints you're encountering? This way, I can provide assistance and support tailored to your needs.
06/10/23, 9:48 pm - +260 97 7822958: We should be active once Maluba Kapaso is done with his examinations by November 2023. My work schedule has been tight.
09/10/23, 10:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Maluba and parents!
How are you? <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 10:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you can just join in for the session for 30-45 minutes?
09/10/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that you and your parents may have commitments here at the school, but it's important to recognize that you've come a long way already. You've successfully completed the counseling process and paid your enrollment fees, showing your dedication to this journey. Just as we follow a fixed timetable for classes and office hours, we have a similar schedule for these essential sessions.
09/10/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: I want to assure you that I value your time. On my end, I've streamlined the process to just a few days, and in some cases, it can even be completed in a single day. Your participation is crucial, and I kindly ask for your cooperation in acknowledging and attending these sessions. It's a small investment of time for the long-term benefit of your education and future success.
09/10/23, 3:09 pm - +260 97 7822958: Greetings, Maluba Kapaso currently has no access to WhatsApp since they are not allowed to carry phones at school.
09/10/23, 3:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if as parents you can discuss the same?
09/10/23, 3:28 pm - +260 97 7822958: We can attend to items that require our attention and for processes that require his attention he can come and attend as earlier requested.
10/10/23, 12:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Maluba can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
