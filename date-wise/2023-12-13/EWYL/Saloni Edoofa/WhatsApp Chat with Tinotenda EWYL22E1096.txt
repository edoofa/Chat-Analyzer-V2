14/08/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 972 4211: Good Morning and how are you Ms. Saloni

I wrote to inform you that the schools have been closed and l am ready to continue with our sessions.

Thank you very much. I will be looking forward to the resumption of thy fruitful and educative sessions
14/08/23, 9:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Tinotenda!
How are you?
14/08/23, 9:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, and even I am ready to take forward your sessions!
14/08/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 972 4211: I am doing Great and l hope you are too
14/08/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held on TUESDAY and FRIDAY - *09:30-11:00 AM* on the EWYL Line.
14/08/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please remember these things clearly:
1) You have to follow the ritual of saying ‘I am a proud edoofian’ *DAILY every morning* on the *EWYL Line*.

Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me *first thing in the morning* - “I am a proud Edoofian”
14/08/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: 2) In our session, we will discuss the following:
- Wednesday Wisdom
- Weekend activities
- Projects
- Newsletter
3) Every month, out of the three projects we have, you have to choose one project on which you will work dedicatedly and make it a _learning and earning experience_.
14/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 972 4211: OK, thank you very much

14/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 972 4211: Noted with thanks
19/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Tinotenda!
How are you?
19/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is the information about Edoofa.
19/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
19/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

19/08/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
19/08/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Thank you very much <This message was edited>
16/10/23, 1:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 1:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

16/10/23, 3:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to go through the newsletter?
16/10/23, 3:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, indeed l have. 
 
I was inspired especially by the mindset that drove Henry Ford, as stated by one of his statements , " If a man did his work well, the price he would get for that work - profits and financial matters - would care for themselves." This resonates with the idea that hard work yields higher productivity. 

And also the last part from the Edoofa Hall of Inspiration taught me that if you set all your effort and energy towards a specific goal, you are bound to attain it even against the odds.
16/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 357 9046: As parents to Tinotenda, we are very much delighted with the progress. We went through the newsletter letter and we are very happy.
Thumbs up Edoofa.

Thank you very much for the message
28/10/23, 5:15 am - +263 78 972 4211: Thank you very much for such an interesting question.

I have to say I am impressed by the Dussehra festival. It helps in the commemoration of victory of good over evil (and the need to always do good) , truth over falsehood and also righteousness over injustice. The festival also embraces and expands the concept of unity as seen by the collective rallying (through festivals) for a common cause, that is to remind and spread goodness among people.

Such a phenomenon had me thinking of the festivals  that we also hold here in Zimbabwe like Chisi as you said earlier and others in the Christian calendar. After breaking down these expressions of belief into their fundamentals, l was able to identify similarities with regards to their objective and conduction.

In Hinduism , taking for example the festival of Dessehra, there is celebration of Lord Rama's triumph over the evil king Ravan. In Christianity there is also the festival of Christmas celebrating the birth of Jesus who comes into the world to save people from evil. This similarity of celebrating an individual liberating the population from evil forces (and many other similarities) sends a message of hope, unity and brotherhood among religions. It also shows how humans all over the world share certain basic needs and desires , like freedom, hope, connection, and renewal.

Thank you very much !
