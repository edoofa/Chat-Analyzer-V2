You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

Meanwhile, I would recommend you to read the following article and understand the importance of Excel, and then share a note with me about why you think Excel is important for a student and its various uses.

06/09/23, 6:58 am - +263 78 541 2782: What is Microsoft Excel and What Does It Do?

This versatile program helps you make sense of your data


Excel is an electronic spreadsheet program that is used for storing, organizing, and manipulating data.

What Excel Is Used For

Electronic spreadsheet programs were originally based on paper spreadsheets used for accounting. As such, the basic layout of computerized spreadsheets is the same as the paper ones. Related data is stored in tables — which are a collection of small rectangular boxes or cells organized into rows and columns.


All versions of Excel and other spreadsheet programs can store several spreadsheet pages in a single computer file. The saved computer file is often referred to as a workbook and each page in the workbook is a separate worksheet.

In newer versions of Excel, each worksheet contains roughly a million rows and more than 16,000 columns, which necessitates an addressing scheme in order to keep track of where data is located.

The horizontal rows are identified by numbers (1, 2, 3) and the vertical columns by letters of the alphabet (A, B, C). For columns beyond 26, columns are identified by two or more letters such as AA, AB, AC or AAA, AAB, etc.

The intersection point between a column and a row is the small rectangular box known as a cell. The cell is the basic unit for storing data in the worksheet, and because each worksheet contains millions of these cells, each one is identified by its cell reference.

A cell reference is a combination of the column letter and the row number such as A3, B6, and AA345. In these cell references, the column letter is always listed first.

Data Types, Formulas, and Functions
Microsoft Excel Formulas and Functions
The types of data that a cell can hold include:


Numbers
Text
Dates and times
Boolean values
Formulas
Formulas are used for calculations — usually incorporating data contained in other cells. These cells, however, may be located on different worksheets or in different workbooks.

Creating a formula starts by entering the equal sign in the cell where you want the answer displayed. Formulas can also include cell references to the location of data and one or more spreadsheet functions.

Functions in Excel and other electronic spreadsheets are built-in formulas that are designed to simplify carrying out a wide range of calculations – from common operations such as entering the date or time to more complex ones such as finding specific information located in large tables of data.

Excel and Financial Data
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with financial data
Spreadsheets are often used to store financial data. Formulas and functions that are used on this type of data include:Performing basic mathematical operations such as summing columns or rows of numbers
Finding values such as profit or loss
Calculating repayment plans for loans or mortgages
Finding the average, maximum, minimum and other statistical values in a specified range of data
Carrying out What-If analysis on data, where variables are modified one at a time to see how the change affects other data, such as expenses and profits
Excel's Other Uses
Microsoft Excel chart
Other common operations that Excel can be used for include:

Graphing or charting data to assist users in identifying data trends
Formatting data to make important data easy to find and understand
Printing data and charts for use in reports
Sorting and filtering data to find specific information
Linking worksheet data and charts for use in other programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint and Word
Importing data from database programs for analysis
Spreadsheets were the original "killer apps" for personal computers because of their ability to compile and make sense of information. Early spreadsheet programs such as VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3 were largely responsible for the growth in popularity of computers like the Apple II and the IBM PC as a business tool.

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳
05/10/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: 🌟 Welcome to India, Jesca!🌍

I am thrilled to have you embark on this exciting journey of higher education in our diverse and culturally rich nation. As you step into this new chapter, we hope you find inspiration, knowledge, and unforgettable experiences that shape your future.

We're eager to know: Have you settled into your new academic adventure? If there's anything you need assistance with, remember that we're here to support you every step of the way.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

20/10/23, 10:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Jesca, why haven't you added subtitles to your video?
20/10/23, 1:15 pm - +91 90536 25107: I was looking for someone to help me
20/10/23, 1:16 pm - +91 90536 25107: I don't know how to put subtitles. Actually so she was busy
20/10/23, 1:16 pm - +91 90536 25107: There are exams going on
20/10/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To add subtitles to a video, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Transcribe Your Video:** First, you'll need to have a transcript of the spoken content in your video. This can be done by typing out what is said in the video as accurately as possible.

2. **Choose a Subtitling Software:** There are various software tools available for adding subtitles to videos. Some popular options include Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, Aegisub, or online tools like Kapwing and Subtitle Edit.

3. **Import Your Video:** Open your chosen software and import your video file.

4. **Create Subtitle Tracks:** Most software allows you to add subtitle tracks or layers. Create a new subtitle track for your video.

5. **Add Subtitles:** Start entering the text from your transcript into the subtitle track. Make sure to specify the timing (start and end times) for each subtitle or caption. This is crucial to sync the text with the video content.

6. **Format and Style:** You can typically customize the font, size, color, and position of the subtitles. Ensure that the subtitles are easily readable and complement the video.

7. **Review and Adjust:** After adding subtitles, review your video to ensure they're properly synchronized. Make any necessary adjustments to the timing and formatting.

8. **Export the Video:** Once you're satisfied with the subtitles, export the video with the subtitles embedded.

The process may vary slightly depending on the software you use, but these are the fundamental steps for adding subtitles to a video. Be sure to check the specific instructions of the software you're using for more detailed guidance.

08/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Jesca!

Even after many messages and reminders, you have not been able to complete your $300 training session with me. However, since this means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey, I am here sharing the grant document with you and something discussed during the training.

So, I would like you to read and provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. Only after this will you be provided with the "Certified Student Leader" certificate.
25/11/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 12:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *1. Different channels for finding potential students*

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
25/11/23, 12:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
25/11/23, 1:35 pm - +91 90536 25107: Okay mam
25/11/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Jesca, I've been flooded with pictures from yesterday's freshers party! But, none from you! Come on, spill the excitement, and share some photos! 

Can't wait to see you! 🎉😄
25/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 90536 25107: Ok
25/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 90536 25107: Jeslyne is the one who was taking pictures
25/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 90536 25107: She will send
25/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 90536 25107: Mam can I have our video call link
25/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 90536 25107: For our today lesson
25/11/23, 5:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You do not have a session today, your call is scheduled for next Saturday.
25/11/23, 5:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Saturday activity*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline: Monday, 27h November 2023* <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 6:02 pm - +91 90536 25107: Competition

It leads to persistence 
Goal oriented
Pressure
Focus
28/11/23, 6:29 am - +91 90536 25107: Saturday activity

It urges one to wanting to read and achieve goals in life. For example when I was in my high school. I used to compete with my friends in our studies
28/11/23, 8:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Jesca!

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

*Time: 6:00 PM*
28/11/23, 10:48 am - +91 90536 25107: Okay
28/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Are you ready for the discussion, Jesca?
28/11/23, 3:13 pm - +91 90536 25107: Yes mam
28/11/23, 3:13 pm - +91 90536 25107: Am sorry mam. I was making dinner
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - +91 90536 25107: Mam can i have my report
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $175 annually. 
Do you remember this?
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 90536 25107: Yes
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great  on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 90536 25107: Mam can I have my report
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 90536 25107: That shows my weibner calls and session time
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Jesca, since you came in early October, we are giving you another chance. Therefore, you have a *golden opportunity* to start looking at your sessions and webinar numbers from now on. We will take some time to evaluate your performance and engagement. Is that alright?
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 90536 25107: Okay
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 90536 25107: Report
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - +91 90536 25107: So my report when will I get it

28/11/23, 3:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 90536 25107: Yes
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hence,  it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
28/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 90536 25107: Okay
28/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 90536 25107: Mam yes I want the card
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: My goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
28/11/23, 4:01 pm - +91 90536 25107: As long as I manage to cover my $425 dollars semester fee before January yes
28/11/23, 4:02 pm - +91 90536 25107: We can pset time. If you want
28/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Jesca! Definitely!  I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
28/11/23, 4:04 pm - +91 90536 25107: Okay mam. Thank you very much. So what will we be doing

28/11/23, 4:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 90536 25107: Okay mam

29/11/23, 1:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Jesca!

After scheduling multiple sessions with you for your $300 training, you could not attend those sessions. Being your mentor, I was concerned about you getting a certificate for student leadership. I even shared the pointers with you without you asking for them. Even after that, you could not share a 4-5 step summary with me?

It breaks my heart to see that even after so many efforts, you never reciprocate, even if these things are for your own benefit. After giving you a lot of days and considering everything, today I will be finalizing the list for Certified Student Leaders at 8:00 PM. If you can, submit your understanding before that.
29/11/23, 1:24 pm - +91 90536 25107: Hello

29/11/23, 1:29 pm - +91 90536 25107: Am sorry mam. Am reading the forms
29/11/23, 1:30 pm - +91 90536 25107: I will share the understanding. This will be the last please forgive me
29/11/23, 1:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Jesca, dear it's for your benefit only! Alright, just do it by today 8:00 PM.
29/11/23, 1:32 pm - +91 90536 25107: Okay am sharing it now

04/12/23, 1:48 pm - +91 90536 25107: *Analysis of Input and Output in Scholarship Enrollment Project* 

Introduction:
The scholarship enrollment project aimed to identify and enroll potential students into a scholarship program. This essay provides a small analysis of the input and output of the project, highlighting the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of the efforts. Furthermore, it explores potential improvements for future projects, setting goals for personal and academic development.

Input Analysis:
The input for the scholarship enrollment project consisted of identifying potential students who met the eligibility criteria. This involved conducting extensive research, reaching out to educational institutions, and utilizing various platforms to spread awareness about the scholarship program. The input also included designing and implementing an application process to evaluate the candidates' qualifications.

Challenges Faced:
1. Limited pool of potential students: One of the major challenges encountered was the limited number of eligible students who met the scholarship criteria. This restricted the overall impact of the project, as only six potential students were identified.

2. Lack of awareness: Despite efforts to spread awareness about the scholarship program, there was a lack of visibility among the target audience. This hindered the enrollment process and limited the number of applications received.

3. Evaluation process: Developing an effective evaluation process to assess the candidates' qualifications proved to be challenging. Ensuring fairness and transparency while considering various factors such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, and financial need required careful consideration.

Lessons Learned:
1. Importance of early planning: The project highlighted the significance of early planning and setting realistic goals. Starting the enrollment process well in advance would have allowed for a wider reach and increased the chances of identifying more potential students.

2. Effective communication strategies: The project emphasized the need for diverse and effective communication strategies to reach the target audience. Utilizing social media platforms, collaborating with educational institutions, and engaging with community organizations could have improved awareness and enrollment.

3. Streamlining the evaluation process: The project shed light on the importance of streamlining the evaluation process. Developing clear criteria and guidelines for assessing candidates' qualifications would have facilitated a more efficient and fair selection process.

Overall Impact:
Despite the challenges faced, the scholarship enrollment project had a positive impact on the lives of the six potential students who were identified. By providing financial support and opportunities for higher education, the project aimed to empower these students and contribute to their personal and academic growth. The impact of the project extended beyond the immediate beneficiaries, as it also raised awareness about the importance of scholarships and education within the community.

Improvement Goals:
1. Enhanced outreach strategies: In future projects, it is crucial to develop more comprehensive and targeted outreach strategies. Collaborating with local organizations, leveraging social media influencers, and conducting awareness campaigns in schools and colleges can help reach a wider audience.

2. Strengthening partnerships: Building strong partnerships with educational institutions, community organizations, and local businesses can enhance the visibility and credibility of the scholarship program.

3. Continuous evaluation and improvement: Regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the enrollment process and making necessary improvements is essential. Collecting feedback from applicants, monitoring the impact of the scholarship program, and adapting strategies accordingly will ensure continuous growth and success.

Conclusion:
The analysis of the input and output of the scholarship enrollment project highlights the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of the efforts. Despite the limited number of potential students identified, the project successfully provided opportunities for higher education to six deserving individuals. By reflecting on the project's shortcomings and setting improvement goals, future projects can be more effective in reaching a larger audience and making a greater impact.

08/12/23, 4:27 pm - +91 90536 25107: Mam my network is dragging a lot
09/12/23, 4:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle_*

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 5:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am curious to understand the reason behind your absence from the session today.

It's just that we connect only once a week, and that too late in the evening after all your classes. Even after that, you are not attending your sessions; it's an alarming situation for me and I want to know the reason so that I can help you with that.
10/12/23, 5:13 am - +91 90536 25107: I had travelled mam for the market, so i came back late. My cellphone had no battery that's why
10/12/23, 5:13 am - +91 90536 25107: Am so

12/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 3:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action tomorrow for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
12/12/23, 4:24 pm - +91 90536 25107: 1. I think am left behind in sharing the forms
2.am thinking of improving my approach in reaching out to the parents and children
3. I was hoping that I will submit at least 8 forms this December
12/12/23, 4:34 pm - +91 90536 25107: Mam does Edoofa scholarship also provide in other countries other than India
