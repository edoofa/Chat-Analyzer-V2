So Joseph has just briefed me about your discussion with him about the Community Building Project.
He told me that If he tells someone about edoofa and joins he's nolonger getting the $20 or $25 per student,  rather he's now getting 💰$300 per student and the breakdown is now as follows 

If the student pays the enrollment fee of $350 he'll get the first 💰$100

And then if the student pays the Registration fee he'll get another 💰$100

And Finally when the student arrives in India he'll get another 💰$100  and this is the 💰$300 plan for the Community Building Project 
Thank you
Have a nice day.

08/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Joseph, we are having a WhatsApp group session!
08/11/23, 2:32 pm - +91 83609 66076: Okay
08/11/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To start, I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:
- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*

I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!
08/11/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:35 pm - +91 83609 66076: Yes I'm done
08/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
08/11/23, 2:40 pm - +91 83609 66076: My community,  My former schools
08/11/23, 2:40 pm - +91 83609 66076: And also on Social media like Facebook
08/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
08/11/23, 2:43 pm - +91 83609 66076: Okay following
08/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
08/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 83609 66076: Okay i see
08/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. 

Kindly read that!
08/11/23, 2:47 pm - +91 83609 66076: Already did mam
08/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, did you notice the questions?
08/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 83609 66076: Yes mam
08/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 83609 66076: Okay mam I'll try my best
08/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 83609 66076: Okay I'll craft the answers and share with you before forwarding to the student
08/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure, kindly refer to the document!
08/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 83609 66076: You will reach out to the potential applicants via various  channels e g FB
 Inform the applicant about your story and the necessary details about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
An applicant will only be eligible if they are knowledgeable about the nature of scholarship,  fees after scholarship,  importance of EWYL program, if their parents are willing to sustain his education and so on....
After knowing these then he'll fill in the Offline application form and sent to mentor
08/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely! I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
08/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 83609 66076: Okay mam
08/11/23, 3:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as a Edoofa Certified Student Leader I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 3:06 pm - +91 83609 66076: Okay thank you mam
08/11/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your *Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity*. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities! <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 3:13 pm - +91 83609 66076: Okay mam, noted
08/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me remind you about these two:

*Wednesday Wisdom* - Every Wednesday, you will receive a detailed lesson on a specific skill of the week. It follows a well-structured curriculum that promotes skill-based learning and enhances creativity among learners. To unlock the full potential of your learning journey, remember that it's not just about reading the lessons; it's about embarking on a quest where completing the tasks is your treasure map. Each task is a key that unlocks a new realm of knowledge and skills. So, don't just be a reader; be an achiever, a taskmaster who harnesses the true power of education.

*Saturday Activities* - In addition to excelling in academics, students need to acquire skills that will help them enhance the physical, artistic, and emotional aspects of their lives and succeed in this competitive world. Therefore, it is important to apply and revise what you learn in the Wednesday lesson. The Saturday activities motivate students to do the same.
08/11/23, 3:16 pm - +91 83609 66076: Okay mam
08/11/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. I want to inform you that, due to the occasion of Diwali, I won't be available from the 10th of October to the 13th of October. During this time, I encourage you to read our Wednesday lessons for today and provide me with your understanding of the significance of Diwali by tomorrow. I look forward to your response.
08/11/23, 3:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

27/11/23, 2:28 pm - +91 83609 66076: **1⃣.  Sutarday Activity: The Spirit of Competition**

Competition has long been hailed as a driving force behind progress, pushing individuals and entities to exceed their limits and reach new heights. The spirit of competition instills a sense of motivation, determination, and a quest for continuous improvement. It is a catalyst for innovation, fostering an environment where excellence is not just encouraged but demanded.

One stricking example is a friendly rivalry that emerged between my childhood friend, Takudzwa, and me. Our battleground was the coding challenges. 

The rivalry wasn't just about who could solve problems faster, it was a quest for mastery, a journey to unravel the secrets of this electronic realm. Debugging became a detective game, and each successfully executed program felt like a victory in a hard fought battle against the constraints of early computing.

The spirit of competition wasn't just about individual glory but a shared passion for pushing the boundaries of what our humble computers could achieve.

As we grew older, our paths diverged, but the lessons learned during those formative years of digital competition left an indelible mark. The spirit of rivalry had not only honed our programming skills but had instilled a lifelong love for technology and innovation. It was a testament to how the spirit of competition, even in the realm of early computing, could be a driving force for personal and intellectual growth.

While the spirit of competition can undoubtedly spur progress, it is crucial to maintain a balance. Unhealthy competition, driven solely by the desire to win at any cost, can lead to negative consequences such as ethical compromises and a disregard for collaboration. Striking the right balance between competition and cooperation is essential to harness the full potential of the competitive spirit.

In conclusion, the spirit of competition serves as a powerful catalyst for human achievement and progress. Whether in the corporate world, sports arena, or other domains of human activity, competition propels individuals and organizations to strive for excellence, fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

*Activity No* 2⃣

EWYL is an initiative by the Edoofa Scholarship Program that allows students to gain Scholarship as a way to help reduce their cost if Education. 

The most fundamental project i did id Community Building. It involves enlightening and finding potential students who are willing to study in india through various techniques like meeting school heads, social media and also physical meeting with the peers.
It involves telling students or parents the enrollment and eligibility processes of being an Edoofian.  During this course i managed to conduct it and i faced challenges of some students doubting the organisation and i learnt to provide maximum possible information to deliver to them about the program like giving them social media handles like FB and IG so that they can navigate and see some proud students acquiring their quality education abroad.

To reduce this problem and make them believe i created a video of myself as a true testimony to prove that Edoofa Scholarship Program is a Legit organisation.

Along going with the project i also discovered that as the students were having exams now we can contact with them full time and i hope I'm going to recruit many students as i can to join the Scholarship Program
