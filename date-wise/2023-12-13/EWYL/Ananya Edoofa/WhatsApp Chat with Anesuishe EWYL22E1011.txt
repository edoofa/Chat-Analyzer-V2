You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

If the heartburn persists or becomes severe, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional for further guidance.

10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - +91 70272 82665: Yes it will be more manageable because right now I'm preparing for my exams that are starting nextweek so Im under a lot of pressure and since I've arrived late I have to catch-up and also because I'm not familiar with the program I'm undertaking it's a bit stressfull
10/10/23, 1:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Anesuishe, I understand that preparing for exams can be stressful, especially if you're playing catch-up and are unfamiliar with the program. Remember to create a study schedule, prioritize, stay organized, and take care of your well-being. Seek help when needed, stay positive, and believe in your abilities. You can do it!
10/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 620 1119: So encouraging thank you Ms Anaya

25/10/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand Anesuishe, however, I think sharing your video won't take much of your time.
25/10/23, 4:11 pm - +91 70272 82665: Yes obviously it won't that's why I said phone and network problems and besides that me getting my phone fixed was the least of my problems because I was under pressure ... I'm undergoing a course I had no background of ,let alone   the university I was supposed to go to got changed at last minute and so was the course and after coming I realise that I'm way behind my class and I have to catch-up with them and to add on to that I'm supposed to appear in the mid term examinations.Mam for me it was not child's play .I was under pressure but now since I've finished like I said I will send the video tomorrow.
25/10/23, 4:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Anesuishe, I have to share the video with our program director, so that we can share the review with you as well. So kindly share it with me as soon as possible.

Link: https://www.instagram.com/p/CzVl_ADBbbz/?img_index=1
08/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Mam
08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
08/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 70272 82665: 1.Why do you think you deserve to be an Edoofian
2.What qualities make you stand out from the rest
3.How can you and your rare qualities transform Edoofa to be a huge merit for yourself and other students.
4.What do you think is the most spectacular aspect of being an Edoofian.
5.Are you able to innovate other ideas that will make you and other African students reach an awesome achievement .
08/11/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Mam that's great and well noted
08/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Mam thank you
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ! I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
08/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Mam ... that's actually great news
08/11/23, 3:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 3:59 pm - +91 70272 82665: After finding my selected group of interested African students ...I ask them my set of questions to see if they have a vision and a mission regarding their higher education and then if they are serious I share my experience and enlighten them upon my journey with Edoofa and I ask them if they have well based knowledge about Edoofa and  after that I see serious and how far they can go with and for Edoofa and if they have passed I offer them the forms
08/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as a Edoofa Certified Student Leader I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 4:07 pm - +91 70272 82665: Thank you so much Ma'am
08/11/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your *Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity*. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:11 pm - +91 70272 82665: That's amazing thank you
08/11/23, 4:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline:* Monday, 25th November 2023

27/11/23, 3:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before, I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $250 annually.

27/11/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - +91 70272 82665: It is redeemed on the second semester after paying half of the tuition fee
27/11/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

30/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is a quick revision:

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts.

30/11/23, 2:43 pm - +91 70272 82665: Yes I'm following Ma'am
30/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
30/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
30/11/23, 2:45 pm - +91 70272 82665: Yes Mam
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
30/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Ma'am Sure thing
30/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
30/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 70272 82665: Yes Ma'am
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Ma'am thank you
30/11/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you calculate your attendance, do you think it's 75%?
30/11/23, 2:56 pm - +91 70272 82665: No it's not
30/11/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well,  I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
30/11/23, 2:57 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Mam
30/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
30/11/23, 3:00 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Mam
30/11/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I know how dedicated you are and personally, I don't want you to miss out on any opportunity, therefore, I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
30/11/23, 3:02 pm - +91 70272 82665: Yes that's right
30/11/23, 3:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.

I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay ma'am I'll try it out
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
30/11/23, 3:08 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Mam thank you
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
30/11/23, 3:15 pm - +91 70272 82665: Thanks Ma'am
30/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, I want to share fact with you that many of you are not realising, while the grant amount is limited, there's no cap on earning scholarship credits.
Recognizing your potential, I will help in personal training to help you to accumulate substantial scholarship credits. Although you're currently ineligible for the grant, with two months left—November and December—ensure your attendance at every session and webinar from this point onward.
30/11/23, 3:18 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Mam ... I'll put my all
30/11/23, 3:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As of now, I am concluding our discussion, and I am hoping for a powerful December where we will work hard and make your parents proud.🤝🏽🏆
30/11/23, 3:24 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay Ma'am
02/12/23, 7:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Anesuishe!

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

08/12/23, 3:28 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay ma'am
09/12/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle_*

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 4:49 pm - +91 70272 82665: It's a Cloud
09/12/23, 4:50 pm - +91 70272 82665: Sorry mam my network was low
09/12/23, 4:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I hope you have not googled it!🤣
09/12/23, 4:53 pm - +91 70272 82665: No ma'am 😂
09/12/23, 4:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
09/12/23, 4:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
09/12/23, 4:55 pm - +91 70272 82665: Okay ma'am seems amazing
09/12/23, 5:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
09/12/23, 5:02 pm - +91 70272 82665: Not really ma'am

12/12/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action tomorrow for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
