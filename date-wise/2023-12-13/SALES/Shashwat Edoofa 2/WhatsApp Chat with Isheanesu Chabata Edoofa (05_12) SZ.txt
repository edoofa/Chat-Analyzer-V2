Your commitment to her education and broader societal impact is truly commendable, Mr. Tonderai!

06/12/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 135 9201: Good Evening
My apologies for not being online for the session.
I'm going through everything thoroughly
06/12/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 293 4591: Observing my daughter's abilities growing up.She is a good communicator and a critical thinker who always asks questions on historical and present societal  issues.She thrives to define present and the future,she captures things first and doesnt accepts things at face value but always weighs up options before taking a decision.Hence l believe she needs a field of problem solving in science and social fields.
06/12/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 293 4591: She was a good history  student and Religious and Moral studies.She then decided on registration for exams to focus on sciences only which she said she has a zeal on.Her ambition was to become an engineer but her results couldnt qualify her to obtain a local university due to Bureaucracy, competition,and lack of finance as a family because of over stretched resources.

08/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 135 9201: I have been playing the marimba on different occasions and I was a member of the Leo Club so we would go to children's homes to visit and went to  some fundraising programs workshops mainly for breast cancer awareness.
I took a gap year in 2023 to find out the program that I could be in to make a huge impact by bringing out my potential. So during that gap year I would read some books and take online courses that took a short time to complete.
Moreover go to more workshops..
I got more involved in the church in singing and organising events .
I have been advocating for the girl child in ending child marriages.
My main achievement on this one was creating a petition for Memory Machaya which later on got recognised by the UN and there are still some changes to be made so I am working on it by using my social media to research and use it as an advantage to reach out to people about this so that we can change the system together at large <This message was edited>

09/12/23, 10:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Isheanesu. Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
09/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 135 9201: Sure!
Initially I wanted to be an aerospace engineer because it was an area where I could make massive ideas on designing and maintenance. Not only that it was an area where I felt it would challenge me to think beyond to create a difference.
Unfortunately because of my points I had to take a moment and reflect on what I truly have to do to fulfill my purpose and I have realised that i am in love with medical sciences. Just the fact that I can resolve a problem is something that I love. Not only that I love the social sciences aspect where I am able to cater the needs of the people.
09/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 135 9201: I'm passionate about the fields of medical science and sociology, and I believe that by combining the knowledge and skills from both fields, I can make a real difference in people's lives. I'm particularly interested in public health, which gives me the opportunity to address the social and environmental factors that influence health, and find ways to improve the health of entire communities. This is a meaningful and fulfilling career path that aligns with my values and interests, and I'm excited to explore
09/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 135 9201: As a public health professional, I want to use my skills and knowledge to advocate for policies and programs that will make a real difference in people's lives. I want to use my understanding of the social determinants of health to address systemic inequalities and ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare. I'm also interested in using data and research to inform my work and make evidence-based decisions. Ultimately, I want to make a positive impact on the health of communities, and improve the quality of life for individuals and families.
09/12/23, 10:18 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
09/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 135 9201: Sure!
I'm more interested in sociology as it is aligned with the vision and goal that I have for the people.
I had this passion for a very long time.
So I got to enhance it by volunteering as an individual at different children's homes and as a former member of the Leo Club I got to experience much more.
During our last session,I have mentioned about how I contributed to the initiative to end child marriages and I still intend to do so. Hence, sociology can be the best program as I will learn more about the societies and how they live.
This is area has always been inside of me so I can safely say it's a calling so that I can be an individual that will positively make an impact in people's lives regardless of their age,gender,race or background.
09/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 135 9201: I have also observed that whenever I hear about problems not only in the world but in my society at time I could get frustrated and ask myself,"what can I really do to bring a change and how I'm going to do it".
I believe that my purpose is to serve the people and I can do that by making an impact through speaking up,making some changes,have the chance to research and solve problems depending on the society or nation
09/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your profound sense of purpose and commitment to making a positive impact on society is truly commendable. The awareness and empathy you display when confronted with societal issues, coupled with your genuine desire to contribute to positive change, reflect a deep and compassionate understanding of the world around you.

09/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 135 9201: Thank you for the question.
With this career, I see myself solving some issues in my country first.
That would be a step forward in developing societies and making sure they are safe places for people to live.  Secondly if I move to a continental level I would like to do my research and play my role in speaking up for those that aren't able to do so also,work with those that were in the sector for a long time in order to gain more knowledge and experience through them.
I would be working very hard so by then I will be selected as one of the Sustainable Development Leaders in the United Nations as a start. So internationally it will be a great advantage as I will be travelling around the world doing my research and solve some issues that I can control.
And various organisations that would want to partner with me.
This program would help me by giving me an immense amount of knowledge and exposure. In addition to this,this program will be an opportunity for me to move a step forward in making this vision come to reality. <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 12:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your visionary approach to addressing societal issues on both national and international fronts through your career aspirations is truly commendable. Your commitment to creating a safer environment in your country and advocating for those without a voice showcases a profound sense of social responsibility. Your strategic plan to collaborate with experienced individuals in the sector and aspire to become a Sustainable Development Leader at the United Nations reflects both foresight and ambition. The dedication you express toward conducting research and actively participating in solving global challenges demonstrates a keen understanding of the complex issues our world faces today. Your pursuit of knowledge and exposure through this program is bound to significantly contribute to the realization of your impactful vision, Isheanesu! However, as your concierge, I'd like to inform you that the career path you've selected will necessitate a high level of responsibility and devotion.

09/12/23, 12:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Isheanesu. *Edoofa* strongly recommends *India* for higher education! May I know what is your knowledge of India and the Indian Education System?
09/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 135 9201: To be honest I have no idea
The only thing I know is that it's educational system is one of the best and highly recommended
09/12/23, 1:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Isheanesu! India's education system and its profound cultural diversity are sources of immense pride and admiration on a global scale. The education system's emphasis on holistic learning and the pursuit of knowledge has produced accomplished individuals who excel in various fields across the world. India's remarkable cultural diversity, with its multitude of languages, traditions, art forms, and cuisines, fosters a rich tapestry of human experiences that inspire unity in diversity.

09/12/23, 1:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that India's contribution to sociology on a global level is both rich and diverse, reflecting the country's vibrant cultural tapestry and complex social dynamics. With a history deeply rooted in ancient civilizations and philosophies, India has provided profound insights into societal structures, norms, and interactions. Pioneering thinkers like B.R. Ambedkar, M.N. Srinivas, and Radhakamal Mukerjee have shaped sociological discourse, addressing issues of caste, gender, and economic inequality. The dynamic interplay of traditions and modernity in India serves as a fascinating case study for sociologists worldwide. Additionally, India's multicultural society, with its myriad traditions and languages, offers a unique lens through which to examine the complexities of social relationships. In essence, India's sociology stands as a compelling narrative, contributing significantly to the global understanding of human societies!

09/12/23, 1:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Isheanesu.
09/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 135 9201: I have read the information
09/12/23, 2:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
09/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 135 9201: It will give me more exposure and profound knowledge so, I know it will mould my critical thinking skills and I aim to achieve my goals by implementing the things that I've been taught during the time of my studies
09/12/23, 3:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
09/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 135 9201: No
09/12/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Isheanesu! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
09/12/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
09/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 135 9201: It's affordable
09/12/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 135 9201: Do you offer earn while you learn type of program?
09/12/23, 3:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well. Isheanesu. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
09/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 135 9201: No
09/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Isheanesu. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
09/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
09/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
09/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
09/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
09/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 135 9201: Well they are all beneficial for me as long as It's moulding me for the future as I work towards bringing about a change
09/12/23, 3:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
09/12/23, 3:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
09/12/23, 3:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
09/12/23, 3:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

09/12/23, 4:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
09/12/23, 4:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
09/12/23, 4:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 135 9201: Employability through practical training.
09/12/23, 4:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Isheanesu! The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
09/12/23, 4:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
09/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 135 9201: They are more than excited as this is a golden opportunity for me 😁
09/12/23, 4:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
09/12/23, 4:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
09/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 135 9201: Yes
09/12/23, 4:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
09/12/23, 4:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/12/23, 4:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
09/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 135 9201: That's great
09/12/23, 4:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
09/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 135 9201: Yes
09/12/23, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
09/12/23, 4:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 8:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

11/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 135 9201: Well I understood how it has a flexible fee payment for the students and the parents.
It is an affordable and negotiable in a way that one is able to lay without going through some challenges <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 9:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*

For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350

11/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 135 9201: 01,02,03,04
11/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 135 9201: I'm at my stage two
11/12/23, 9:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
11/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 135 9201: Yes
11/12/23, 9:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

11/12/23, 11:16 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
