12/12/23, 8:17 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yes sir
12/12/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 372 3003: I'm free now
12/12/23, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Munashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Munashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 372 3003: I have learnt a lot from Munashe, firstly considering our my background here in Zimbabwe l have noticed that getting a scholarship at your institution will be a great opportunity for me as they offer quality education. Not only do you offer quality education but quality life skills. It has always been my passion to know more or study different cultures" diversity" and with the help of Edoofa l can aquire some of those skills
12/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 372 3003: According to my research l also came across this program where one has to earn money while learning which is also good for us as students because we don't just have to learn theory without applying it to practical like what most universities in Zimbabwe are doing. So it is what also differs Edoofa from other institutions as it teaches us theory and also teach is to apply what we learn into practice
12/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 372 3003: Sorry about late replies l'm having network problems but lm trying my best to get in touch
12/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Ndhlovu! It's fantastic to hear about your interest in Edoofa. The opportunity to receive quality education coupled with life skills is indeed a standout feature of the institution. Your passion for understanding different cultures and diversity aligns perfectly with what Edoofa offers, creating a space where you can acquire these invaluable skills.
12/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Let me give you a brief about the program myself.
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 372 3003: Exactly, l want to help reduce the burden of my parents
12/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yeah it will be a great opportunity for me if l get this scholarship as it will help me gain quality skills and education as well as helping my parents reduce their financial burden
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Ndhlovu, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Definitely
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 372 3003: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Now Prosper, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
12/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 372 3003: My name is Njabulo Prosper Ndhlovu, a boy aged 19 residing in Amaveni a high density area in the city of Kwekwe Zimbabwe.
•) Currently l am waiting for my A'level results as l aspire to be an electrical or mechanical engineer. •)My dad is a truck driver and my mother a teacher and still not employed which,  makes it difficult for both l and my siblings to acquire quality education because my father is the only one working yet earning peanuts, and l believe that he is the one who will be supporting me with my education abroad.
 •)Since nursery up to now my parents are the ones that have been supportinge with my education.
•) My mom and dad managed to acquire their O'level certificates as their highest level of education.

In an addition l would like to say that my parents have always taught me that education is the key to success and their teachings are the one's that are driving me to acquire what l want to be in life.
12/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: That's a wonderful addition, Prosper! The guidance and teachings of parents about the significance of education as a pathway to success are incredibly valuable. Their wisdom and support serve as a guiding force, motivating you to pursue your aspirations and work towards your goals in life.

12/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Because since childhood it has always been my passion to design and construct models of machines and especially with the combination l was doing in Physics we would always design and construct models of certain machines. Also when there is a problem with household circuits be it lighting systems etc l fix the problem and because of this l have gained passion in wanting to be in these fields rather than medicine
12/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Prosper, your passion for electrical and mechanical engineering since childhood is truly inspiring! It's fantastic that from a young age, you were drawn to designing and constructing machine models, showing a natural inclination toward understanding how things work and are built. The combination of designing models in physics further fueled your interest in these fields, highlighting your knack for hands-on problem-solving and creativity.
12/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in these fields?
