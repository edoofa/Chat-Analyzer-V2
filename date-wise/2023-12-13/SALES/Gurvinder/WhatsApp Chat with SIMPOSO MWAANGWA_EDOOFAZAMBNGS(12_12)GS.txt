Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/12/23, 12:13 pm - +260 97 4435010: So according to what I have seen in the group discussion...I think this is a scholarship program that is helping learners persue in different courses provided by the university especially African countries
12/12/23, 12:22 pm - +260 97 4435010: And the other thing is that we need good results which are credit or better
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - +260 97 4435010: It also deals with private institutions that offer scholarships in india
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes sir/madam
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 4435010: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - +260 97 4435010: Thank you for the information and the programs u are offering is exactly what I want
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: It is Sir.
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Simposo, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +260 97 4435010: Oh sorry
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes I do sir
