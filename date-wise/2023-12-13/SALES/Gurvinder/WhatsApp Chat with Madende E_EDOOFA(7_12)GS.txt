07/12/23, 8:02 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
07/12/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 065 2950: You are welcome sir
08/12/23, 7:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/12/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 065 2950: Morning sir
08/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Madende, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Nokuthaba, is that correct?
08/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 065 2950: Yes of course
08/12/23, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Nokuthaba, also do tell me whether you learnt about Nokuthaba’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 065 2950: I learnt that Edoofa is a program that helps students find and apply for scholarship. 
I learnt that it's designed to help students cover the cost of college.
08/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 065 2950: No she didn't tell me about her journey
08/12/23, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/12/23, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
08/12/23, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/12/23, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/12/23, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/12/23, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 065 2950: Yes it is Sir
08/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 065 2950: I hope yu are going to help me
08/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Sibongile, that is all I want.
08/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Sibongile, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
08/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 065 2950: Umm yes I do have
08/12/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now Madende, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way <This message was edited>

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Technology (BTech) Chemical Engineering*
11/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 065 2950: Sure
I'm so glad
11/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
11/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
11/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 065 2950: Yes,l am sir
11/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
11/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 065 2950: Yes you may
11/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Technology (BTech) Chemical Engineering* is a four year undergraduate degree in engineering. Candidates that are A-level or equivalent are eligible to take admission in this BTech course. The BTech Chemical Engineering syllabus is based on the fundamentals of mathematics, physics and chemistry. Therefore, you must have an aptitude in these subjects in order to excel as a chemical engineer.
11/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: A BTech Chemical Engineering degree can get you a job in different sectors like Oil, Gas and Energy, Manufacturing and consumer goods, Pharmaceuticals, Chemical Industries and various PSUs.
11/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: BTech Chemical engineering students have a plethora of options for higher studies. Students can do their MS, MBA, M.Tech or PhD from India and abroad after completing the BTech Chemical Engineering course.
11/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 065 2950: 🤔ok ok l get it sir
11/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
11/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 065 2950: Yes sir
11/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
11/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 065 2950: Ok sir
11/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 065 2950: If l get into this programme,I can see that this can enable me to achieve my dream as it offers a course that l want.If lm provided with this career option l can see myself somewhere you know. I can see a bright future for myself after the completion of this course.
11/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Madende I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
11/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 065 2950: Yes sir, l will do whatever it takes to achieve my dreams.
11/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
11/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 065 2950: It's because it takes less time for me to achieve my goals as compared to studying here. But above all it's just my dream to study abroad especially India
11/12/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
11/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 065 2950: All l can is that l have to study abroad first so that l can see the areas that need to developed and how can develop the systems in my country
11/12/23, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Madende, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
11/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 065 2950: Yes that's it sir
11/12/23, 7:58 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
12/12/23, 8:14 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/12/23, 8:26 am - +263 78 065 2950: Morning
12/12/23, 9:21 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
12/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 065 2950: Yes,l want to know why
12/12/23, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
12/12/23, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

12/12/23, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: So now Madende, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
12/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 065 2950: Ok.
Is it possible to change the course?
12/12/23, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: May I know the course you want to opt now, and the reason behind it?
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 065 2950: Medicine,you know saving  people's lives. 
And l have heard also that lndia has the best or l would say it provides the highest education when it comes to medicine.
12/12/23, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Madende, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
12/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 065 2950: Ok 
I did physics and chemistry only which means it's impossible for me to study any health care course or
12/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy
2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy
3. Bachelors in Optometry
4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology
5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics
6. Bachelor of Science in BioChemistry
7. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology
