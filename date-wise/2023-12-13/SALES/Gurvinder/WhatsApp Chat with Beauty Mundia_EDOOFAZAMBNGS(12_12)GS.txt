I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

I am here to discuss the application of Nchimunya

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/12/23, 12:08 pm - +260 97 0269699: Good morning sir
12/12/23, 12:11 pm - +260 97 0269699: All I know about Edoofa is that it's a sponsorship program that tries to help us in our academic life especially African countries....it gives us an opportunity to study in India at high institutions.
12/12/23, 12:23 pm - +260 97 0269699: It is also a merit based program.... and that Edoofa works with private institutions in India that offer scholarships
12/12/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
12/12/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
12/12/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/12/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/12/23, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

12/12/23, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 0269699: You are right sir
12/12/23, 1:27 pm - +260 97 0269699: It's everyone's wish to reduce the financial burden on our parents and also to become independent
12/12/23, 1:29 pm - +260 97 0269699: This is good
12/12/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Beauty, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - +260 97 0269699: To be honest with you sir...I have the first one but as for the second one my dad is having a meeting today and he is the one who was added to this group... but he is aware of this he will join us shortly..... otherwise I have them <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 1:59 pm - +260 97 1873656: Good afternoon. What Beauty has said is true and when I'm free,I will be available and following the whole counseling process
12/12/23, 2:02 pm - +260 97 1873656: So far so good as I have followed this session from its inception,will be following and contributing where possible and when there is need

12/12/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Agri business or software engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind these fields of study?
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - +260 97 0269699: I would like to study these two majors because they inspire me... Also looking at the level where we are now the government is highly encouraging agriculture related things and it's much easier for one to earn a living if they did an agriculture course because one can work for themselves without necessarily working for the government software engineering is also good in the sense that the world is evolving everything we do is now dealing with technology and computers so I would love to deal with computers. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 3:53 pm - +260 97 1873656: Very interesting dialogue here
12/12/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Beauty, your interest in Agribusiness and Software Engineering reflects a forward-thinking approach and an understanding of the evolving landscape in both fields.

Your inclination towards Agribusiness, especially considering the government's encouragement and the growing potential in agriculture-related ventures, demonstrates a keen awareness of opportunities in this sector. It's great that you recognize the potential for self-employment and entrepreneurship within agriculture, enabling individuals to create their own path rather than relying solely on governmental employment.

Additionally, your interest in Software Engineering aligns with the rapidly evolving technological landscape. Recognizing the significance of technology in our daily lives and the increasing reliance on computers, pursuing a career in Software Engineering is a fantastic way to be at the forefront of this technological advancement.
12/12/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in these fields?
12/12/23, 4:35 pm - +260 97 0269699: Not really but my elder cousin is studying something to do with agriculture which is general agriculture
12/12/23, 6:29 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
12/12/23, 6:33 pm - +260 97 0269699: Thank you
12/12/23, 7:04 pm - +260 97 1873656: Thank you very much and we appreciate your gesture
