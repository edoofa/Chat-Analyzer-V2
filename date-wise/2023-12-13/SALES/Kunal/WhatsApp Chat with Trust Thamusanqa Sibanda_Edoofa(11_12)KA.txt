11/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 361 0222: 1. I am in lower 6 now going to Upper six next year and I am doing Maths, Physics and Geography                                            2. I would like to study electical engineering because I did a research regarding this program since I always desired to be an engineer but I had no idea which type of engineer would I want to be until I did some research and I saw that electrical engineering is the one for me since I know a few about electricity and currently there is shortage of electric supply in our country due to poor knowledge regarding electricity.So I would like to do this program so that I would help our country with some knowledge I would have learned or studied in India.              3. My mother is a counsellor and My father is a Bookeper.        4. My father did his diploma of accounting at the University of South Africa and my Mother also had her diploma of counselling which she was helped by Zimbabwe Open University.        5. Yes I do have 2 siblings,an elder brother who is doing a degree of Supply chain management, logistics and procurement at the University of Chinhoi right here in Zimbabwe and he is currently in his second year. I also have a an older sister who is also the first born in one family and she is now 25, she did her degree of Social welfare at the University of Zimbabwe and she is currently not going to work due to shortage of jobs in our country.                                6. My father and Mother.             7. That's exactly why I needed this scholarship because I don't think my parents would be able to support me on their own while I am in India due to little salaries they are receiving in our country due to high inflation. But my parents will be the one supporting me.                            8. $120

11/12/23, 2:02 pm - Kunal: So, do you have any past experiences or learnings in the field of Electrical Engineering?
11/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 361 0222: I actually don't have any experience but I did learn about electricity when we were studying a topic about electricity under Physics
11/12/23, 2:09 pm - Kunal: That is fine
So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e. O level results, please?
A picture would be better
11/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Ok sure
11/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 361 0222: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:25 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
11/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 361 0222: I will definitely make sure that I will get that scholarship as I will study harder starting from next term so as to ensure best results
11/12/23, 2:37 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects and passion for Electrical Engineering, you are eligible for:

*Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering*

Shall I explain the course in depth?
11/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Yes you may continue sir
11/12/23, 2:39 pm - Kunal: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of electrical and electronics equipment. Electrical Engineering course study includes Circuit analysis, machines & drive system, Power System, Control system, Power electronics, Utilization etc. The main focus of the course will be on industrial requirement of ‘Electrical engineering’.

The scope for students of B. Tech Electrical Engineering is very high. There are two options available for them either they can join higher education after this course or they can join their professional career as per skills. At present, electrical engineers have great demand in the market.
 
An objective of this course is to ensure the success of the students for a long time. Students can develop their electrical skills and abilities with the study of this course. They also can improve abilities of professional attitude, effective communication skills as well.

Electrical Engineering has very good career opportunities in professional career such as all power generation, transmission; distribution companies can offer them a very good remuneration as per their skills. Apart from that other sectors like MNC companies, IT companies, steel, cement, fertilizer, petrochemical, shipping, traction, automobile companies etc. can give them best job offers with high salary packages.
11/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Thank you sir for guiding me through this program I really appreciate
11/12/23, 2:42 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that!
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
11/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 361 0222: In 5 years time I will be one of the best engineers in our country after finishing my course. Moreso, I would use my Edoofian skills to help our country with the little knowledge they wouldn't have and help them to reduce shortage of electrical power in our country
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
11/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 361 0222: According to the research I did, India is one of the counties offering affordable school services and producing best results. Infact,India it is concurrent and it produces best results and it is in the 10 top in the world
11/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 361 0222: It also offers free education during your primary and secondary which is very good
11/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Moreso according to my last research, your education level is at stage 2
11/12/23, 3:02 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
11/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 361 0222: According to my research it cost $700
11/12/23, 3:06 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 3:06 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 361 0222: I think it is good figure but my family will not afford it due to the current economy in our country
11/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: I understand
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
11/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Of course I know how it is done and I think I will try that
11/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
11/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/12/23, 3:12 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
11/12/23, 3:13 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:13 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
11/12/23, 3:13 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
11/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Yes I think I will benefit from the EWYL
11/12/23, 3:18 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Thank you sir I think my family would afford the rest fees
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
11/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Point number 4
11/12/23, 3:23 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

11/12/23, 3:24 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
11/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Both my parents
11/12/23, 3:27 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
11/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 361 0222: They feel really proud of me and they believe it will help me become one of the recognized engineers in our country
11/12/23, 3:31 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
11/12/23, 3:31 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
11/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 361 0222: 1. Valid Passport.                            2. Visa.                                                3. Police clearances.                4. My Ordinary level and A level certificates.                           And also the ones which you have mentioned above.
11/12/23, 3:35 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
11/12/23, 3:35 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
11/12/23, 3:36 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Ok sir noted and it is indeed affordable
11/12/23, 3:39 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
11/12/23, 3:39 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
11/12/23, 3:39 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Wow that is really great
11/12/23, 3:42 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Stage 2
11/12/23, 3:45 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
11/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Yes sir you may continue
11/12/23, 3:47 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
11/12/23, 3:47 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.
11/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Ok sir noted

12/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: I appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career
12/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: Trust, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 361 0222: 1. Electrical Engineering                          2. India.                                                   3.  6000-8000.                                       4. 2000-3000.                                5. 350 and is paid within 7 days.                                                   6. It is a program whereby you have to work whilst learning. This program helps you to cover some of your school expenses as the money you will earn whilst working, you will use it to pay for your school fees. The Edoofa program will help you to apply for the earn while you learn program in India. They will be different types of jobs for examples working at a radio station. The jobs might also pay up to 100 per month so that by the end of the year you will be able to cover half of school fees.                 7. No because the registration fees will be paid before receiving your offer letter then after receiving your acceptance letter then you will pay for your school fees
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Kunal: Good work, Trust
Let me help you understand the 7th question
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Kunal: The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600
12/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 361 0222: Thank you sir for helping me understand
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Kunal: You are welcome
