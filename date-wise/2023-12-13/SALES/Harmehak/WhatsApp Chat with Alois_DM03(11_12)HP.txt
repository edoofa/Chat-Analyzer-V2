You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
12/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 461 7198: Yh I understand the program ms harmehak
12/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 461 7198: Yh that's my dream ms harmehak

12/12/23, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: Very well,

12/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Yes
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Alois, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Owk ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 461 7198: As for now  l live this opportunity to my father maybe he has some questions for you
12/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: He can surely share them please.
12/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Can I ask you something ms Harmehak ?
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 461 7198: I need to know the requirements for this scholarship
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Which requirements are you referring to, Alois?
12/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Meaning my number of points at A level ..
12/12/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Owk I get you now so are we still proceeding with the program or I finished my application
12/12/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: We are still in the Counseling session, Alois.
12/12/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Forensic Accounting?
12/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Owk ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 461 7198: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Accounting, Business study and Economics my A level combination
12/12/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please
12/12/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: What motivates you to study Forensic Accounting?
12/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 306 5310: Nothing Ms hamehak .we are together let's proceed with your questions
12/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Its like it is my dream since when I was little in primary level and some people say it is the best program in commercials..
12/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright please Mr Simon.
12/12/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: I would like to know your thoughts on the discussion so far and if you are willing to support Alois's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?
12/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 306 5310: This schoolar ship is it 100 percent to offer a students or  we share Ms hamehak .yes now I m working as a labour officer but we faced a challenge of financial to support my childrens .so I need a help to you to assist me and alois for a scholarship
12/12/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
12/12/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship please?
12/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 461 7198: I think he's trying to say the schoolaship is providing me everything in terms of fees and accommodation and stuff
12/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 306 5310: Yes correct
12/12/23, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 461 7198: I get you ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
12/12/23, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: So are you willing to support his education along with the scholarship, Mr Simon?
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 306 5310: Noted we are together Ms  harmehak I'm supporting his education
12/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 306 5310: I'm willing Ms harmehak
12/12/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please, Mr Simon.
12/12/23, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

On that note, let me brief you about your desired course, 

*Bachelor of commerce - Honors in Accounting*
12/12/23, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.

12/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Noted but these jobs are also found there in India
12/12/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 461 7198: That's great
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 306 5310: Wonderfully 👏
12/12/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
12/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright then Alois, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 461 7198: Maybe I will be someone who is self-esteem and making some money there because my I wish is to work there so that I will help my parents in Zimbabwe
12/12/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: That is great Alois, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 461 7198: I would like to study different languages and cultures and as for now in Zimbabwe I found it difficult to find a job after finishing my course because of corruption and stuff
12/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 461 7198: In addition some of the students in Zimbabwe who finish their coarse are not going work due lack of jobs in Zimbabwe so that's why I want to study abroad and work there
12/12/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: You see, Alois, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
12/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 461 7198: You see so it is better for me to study there and work there too
12/12/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Alois.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.
