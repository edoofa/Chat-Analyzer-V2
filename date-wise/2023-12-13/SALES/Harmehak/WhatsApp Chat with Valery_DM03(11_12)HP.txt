You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd.

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
12/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 528 0118: My name is Valery Ruvimbo Juru, a student at Daramombe High School who just finished her lower six there. I also completed my ordinary level studies at Daramombe as well. I completed my primary level here in Chitungwiza at Zengeza 5 Primary.Well growing up I have always been so interested in computers from the start and i have grown to be more passionate about it. Given that I am doing computer science,  businesss studies and mathematics now I would really want to study computer science given that I am so driven with the subject and I am positive I will do exceptionally well. Academically I can say I'm a slightly above average student and with hard work can produce pleasing results. I am a creative person and a good teamworker as well. I am good at adapting to changing situations. I can also say I struggle with delegating tasks. 

I am an athlete as well as a chess player who was proud to represent her school in the nationals this year. I enjoy reading novels during my free time.

My father has a diploma in physiotherapy and works as a Physiotherapist at Chitungwiza hospital .My mother has a diploma in teaching and works at Zengeza 5 Primary. We are 4 in our family 1 boy and 3 girls. My brother is an ICT auditor, my sister is a laboratory scientist and my other sister is a Safety Health Environmental Officer
12/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Valery, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to see that you are hardworking and a dedicated student who is equally invested in sports.

I can see your parents have lead a family that greatly values education and your siblings pursuing proper careers is a great example.
12/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Are you following please Mrs Grace?
12/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Yes yes Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So far do you have any queries please?
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Yes l would  like to know the types of schoolerships that you offer
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Like, are they fully or part funded .are students  allowed  to work whiles  studying
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Thank you for enlightening  me on that one ,the last past when you   said someone has to work for the organization  after completing  a course is quite good .that's  how we used to get our tertiary education here.we would be given grants for the 3 or 4 years then after completing  the course  when u start working  a certain  percentage  was deducted  from your salary  to fund others  and education was for all the rich and the poor
12/12/23, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: That's not the case please,

They earn and work during their course itself please,

I would discuss the details of Earn While You Learn Program with you.
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Kkkkk thank u for setting  the record straight  l think  she can earn more than 6 points
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 286 6794: We are very confident  she is going to score higher
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, Mrs Grace.

She shared she wishes to pursue Computer science, 

Are you aware of the same please?
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Yes but we don't  know other programs  that she can do with her combination  Maths ,computers science  and BS
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Considering her subjects combination, she can pursue the following:

*Bachelor of science in computer science*
*Bachelor in Computer Applications*
*Bachelor in business administration*
*Bachelor of science - honors in Accounting*
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 528 0118: can we get more details on bachelor of science in computer science
12/12/23, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
