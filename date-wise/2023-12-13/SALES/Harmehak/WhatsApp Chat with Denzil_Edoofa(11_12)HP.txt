12/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
12/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 510 9943: It is interesting indeed...
I'm taken by provision of employability driven strategies in order to become future leaders
12/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 510 9943: And Edoofa is well known and recognized internationally
12/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Yes please Denzil
12/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 71 510 9943: Very true
 I'm impressed
So how is the education life with edoofa... I'm interested in  knowing  more about the edoofa schoolarship
12/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: We will discuss everything in detail.
12/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Denzil, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
12/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 510 9943: Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to the edoofa team for responding to my application.I'm Lungelo Denzil Machekano aged 18. I did both my O and A level at Matopo High school and I'm currently waiting for my A level results.Dedication to school work is my first principle.However, i have learnt that dedication to school work goes with striving for a complete character and discipline so that learning becomes prosperous.All these values made me get flourishing results during my Ordinary level. I'm astonished to have got 5As 4Bs and 2Cs in a science class.
I'm interested in the field of medicine or Pathology. 
One of my strengths is working hard and punctuality to be a great leader in the future. I'm not much of  a sport person but one of my hobbies would be playing darts. 
I live with my mother who holds a degree in Records and Archives  and  is currently an Archivist  at ministry of health and Child care.I don't have any siblings.
12/12/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Denzil, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Thank you
12/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Well Denzil, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
12/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes! higher education abroad is a life changing decision. However, higher education can be skill development, practical learning or a conductive environment and I'm sure edoofa covers all these aspects refering to the articles i have read and the  video I have watched.
12/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Denzil 

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
12/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 510 9943: I'm very ready and i hope the place is environmentally friendly to accept me.
12/12/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Ofcourse it is, Denzil.

Our students are our first priority and you would definitely learn more.
12/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Denzil, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes they are aware snd they are willing to support me
12/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 510 9943: and*
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 848 0330: I am supporting him
12/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please

It's great to have you acknowledge yourself.
12/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Noted please.
12/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 510 9943: I'm confident that i will maximize and aim higher
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 510 9943: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 510 9943: My A level combination was
Pure Mathematics
Chemistry
Biology
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Medicine, Denzil?
12/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 510 9943: The ability to help other people and save lives is the one that motivates me the most and be recognized as the best doctor. However, I'm the first in my family to be in a science and that motivates me to make a pace and inspire the next generation of my family to become doctors that would make a difference.
12/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 510 9943: To be in a science class*
12/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have a kind heart that wishes to do well, Denzil.

So did you also happen to research about the requirements of your desired field?
12/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 510 9943: I only know that you should get straight As to get into the field.. But i would love to know more from you.
12/12/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
12/12/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay so if i have Mathematics
Biology
Chemistry
I won't be able to pursue medicine
12/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Physics is a mandatory requirement please
12/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
12/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 510 9943: How about medical laboratory technology
12/12/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: You can surely pursue the same, 

So what intrigued you towards Medical Laboratory Technology, Denzil?
12/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 510 9943: I want to do something that will land me in a  hospital and i saw medical laboratory science as a solution because it will make me work with doctors so that i provide correct test results and diagnosis
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: That's well thought off, Denzil.
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Following would be description about Medical Laboratory Technology!
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is an undergraduate Medical Lab Technology program which is a 3 years course. Medical Laboratory Technology program also called Clinical laboratory science is an allied health profession that is concerned with the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of disease through the use of clinical laboratory tests. During the program these tests help candidates to learn and diagnose, detect and treat diseases. Additionally the program deals with the collecting of information's sampling, reporting, testing and documentation.


Such graduates are hired in capacities such as Laboratory Technician, Laboratory Manager, Medical Officer, Research Associate, Medical Record Technician, Resident Medical Officer, Lab Assistant, Laboratory Testing Manager, Associate Professor/Lecturer etc.

Medical technicians can get job opportunities in places such as hospitals, health care clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists’ offices, etc.
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: *A Bachelor in Medical Laboratory Technology student could work in the field of forensic medicine as a forensic laboratory technician, performing tasks such as analyzing samples and testing specimens to assist in criminal investigations and trials. However, they may need to obtain additional training and certification specific to forensic science. Additionally, the specific job responsibilities and requirements may vary depending on the laboratory and jurisdiction.*
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

A Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology prepares individuals to work in medical laboratories, where they perform a variety of tests to analyze biological samples and support the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Graduates with this degree can pursue careers in the healthcare and medical field, including:

Medical Laboratory Technologist

In these roles, individuals with a Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology may be involved in performing laboratory tests to detect the presence of diseases, analyzing and interpreting test results, and working with healthcare professionals to develop and implement effective treatments. These professionals play a critical role in supporting the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, and their work is essential to the effective functioning of healthcare organizations.
12/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 510 9943: It is an interesting career indeed
12/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 510 9943: So since its a 3 year course is there an  attachment training during the course of learning?
12/12/23, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Yes can surely request for an attachment,

While you would anyway be a part of the Earn While You Learn Program.
12/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay that's great
12/12/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same?
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes I'm interested
12/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Denzil, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 510 9943: If i get the opportunity to study this career i see my self as an qualified Medical laboratory scientist with a first class degree working in a hospital helping hand in hand with others inorder to save lives. Edoofa would help me study this career and find me the best university to study this career and it will solve my financial problems
12/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Denzil, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Zimbabwe has high levels of inflation so the fees are high and i believe that if edoofa schoolarship accepts me it would help me solve my problem. Studying abroad will help me interact with other student and professors in the department to pursue a prosperous career
12/12/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure, Denzil.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
12/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Studying in India would help me very much because of the affordable compared to many of the world's finest institutions, India's low cost of education is a bargain according to my research scholarships are  available to offset the cost. It is said India's economy continues to surge. India is also known for comprehensive tax system, business friendly laws, low operational costs.Not to forget that the CEOs of companies like Google, pepsi, Microsoft etc are all Indians that makes the education in Indian ranked high and this proves that there is quality education in India
12/12/23, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Denzil.

I am glad you have awareness and knowledge about the country.
12/12/23, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

12/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 510 9943: That's great
12/12/23, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you are thoroughly following, Denzil.

Did you go through the entire resources?
12/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes I'm fascinated by what the pictures tell me
12/12/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Denzil.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 510 9943: No i didn't get that during my research
12/12/23, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
12/12/23, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/12/23, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/12/23, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay that is good
12/12/23, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Denzil, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
12/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay so i have to pass my A level remarkably to get a fully funded schoolarship
12/12/23, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: Can you please share your understanding of a fully funded scholarship?
12/12/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 510 9943: A fully funded schoolarship is the one given to students who excelled in their results with higher grades hence a fully funded schoolarship would cover all the tuition fees, the visa and other expenses
12/12/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay thank you for making me understand
12/12/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
12/12/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same too?
12/12/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes
12/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
12/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 71 510 9943: No i don't have
12/12/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

Now did you understand regarding the 90-100% scholarship?
12/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Not really please explain further
12/12/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
12/12/23, 5:55 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay I understand now
12/12/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Denzil, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/12/23, 5:57 pm - +263 71 510 9943: I agree
12/12/23, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Denzil?
12/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Yes
12/12/23, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
12/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 510 9943: Okay thank you
