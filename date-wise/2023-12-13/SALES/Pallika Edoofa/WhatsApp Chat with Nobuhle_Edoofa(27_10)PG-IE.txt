30/11/23, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nobuhle, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
30/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 708 8302: Wow, it is wonderful that the scholarship program has been expanded to make it more accessible for students like me! I appreciate you explaining the details and providing all the necessary information. I understand the importance of maximizing my points to increase my chances of receiving a higher quantum of scholarship. I am confident in my abilities and am motivated to do my best. Thank you for all your support.
30/11/23, 2:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
30/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 708 8302: You are absolutely right - studying abroad is a dream for many students in my country, and I am honored to have this opportunity. I have done some research on foreign education and have looked into various universities around the world that offer the courses I am interested in. I have not yet applied to any universities, but I am excited to start the process and make my dream a reality.
30/11/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 708 8302: I completely agree with you - employability is a major issue for young people all over the world. I appreciate you sharing this perspective and helping me to understand the difference between Scholarship Programs and agents who focus on university admissions. I would love to read the article you mentioned - I am always looking for ways to learn more and improve my understanding.
30/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 708 8302: I just took a look at the article you mentioned - it is very informative and eye-opening! It clearly explains the difference between scholarship programs and education agents, and how a scholarship program like Edoofa has an end goal of making me employment-ready and giving me a leg up in the competitive job market. I am now more aware of the benefits of a scholarship program like this and what I can gain from it. Thank you for sharing this! 😄
30/11/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nobuhle, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
30/11/23, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you do not have Biology, so, please let me know your alternate career aspirations.
30/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 708 8302: Thank you for sharing this information - it is very helpful to know the specific requirements for studying different subjects in India. Since I do not have Biology, I am now considering other career options that are a good fit for me. I am interested in computer science, and I am thinking about studying software engineering or computer programming. Do you think these would be a good fit for me?

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

So, are you prepared to put in *200%* effort and seize any possibilities that come your way in order to alter your career?
02/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 708 8302: I really appreciate your honesty and your desire to help me be realistic about my future goals. I am prepared to put in the hard work and dedication necessary to succeed in this field. I am fully committed to doing everything in my power to make my goals a reality. So yes, I am prepared to give it my all and seize any opportunities that come my way. Do you have any tips for how to stay motivated and focused on my goals? 😄

02/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 708 8302: I love your advice on setting small goals and rewarding myself for my achievements. Balancing hard work with self-care is such an important factor in staying motivated and productive. It's easy to become overwhelmed and lose sight of the end goal when the focus is solely on the work. So, thank you for reminding me of the importance of self-care. Also, building a supportive network is something I will prioritize, as it can be so helpful to have people who understand and support your goals. Thank you for all your valuable advice.

04/12/23, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
04/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 708 8302: I absolutely am intrigued by all the amazing opportunities India offers for higher education. If I were to study in India, I believe it would have a positive impact on my career in several ways. Firstly, I would be able to gain access to some of the world's best educational resources and facilities, which would give me a strong foundation for success.

04/12/23, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nobuhle, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
04/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 708 8302: Well, international students who do not have a scholarship in India can expect to pay a considerable amount of money for a comparable quality of higher education. This is because tuition fees and living expenses in India can be quite high, especially when compared to other countries. For example, a degree from one of the top Indian universities like the IITs can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 per year, not including living expenses. That said, I believe that the cost of higher education in India is still relatively affordable compared to other countries, especially when one takes into account the high quality of education and the range of opportunities that
04/12/23, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nobuhle, I appreciate that you have a researched for the same but Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

04/12/23, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
04/12/23, 10:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,

05/12/23, 8:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright
05/12/23, 9:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
05/12/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 708 8302: Wow, that's quite a substantial reduction in annual fees, even after taking into account the Edoofa Scholarship! And then having the opportunity to reduce the fees even further through the Earn While You Learn Program is fantastic. I have to say, that would definitely make it much more affordable for many families. It sounds like Edoofa is really committed to making sure its students can access quality education at an affordable price. That's amazing! 🙌
05/12/23, 9:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
05/12/23, 9:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
05/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 708 8302: That sounds really intriguing! I'd love to learn more about the process for earning scholarship credits while studying. That could be an amazing way for students to earn money while furthering their education. So how does it work? What kind of work do the students do, and how are they compensated for their efforts? 🙌
05/12/23, 9:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/12/23, 9:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

05/12/23, 9:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 9:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
05/12/23, 9:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
05/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 708 8302: I think the Earn While You Learn Program sounds like a great way for students to gain real-world experience while earning credit towards their degree. It's not only a financial benefit, but it also helps students develop the skills and knowledge they'll need to succeed after graduation. I definitely think it would be a valuable program for any student. And I'm especially interested in the webinars you mentioned - they sound like a great way to learn from the experiences of others and gain valuable insights into the world of work. 👩‍💻
05/12/23, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
05/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 708 8302: That's incredible! So basically, a student's education can be almost entirely funded by their work through the Earn While You Learn Program. And the more effort they put in, the more they can reduce their costs. It's really a win-win for the student and their family. And the opportunity to gain real-world experience while still in school is invaluable. This sounds like a fantastic program, and it's clear that Edoofa is committed to making education accessible and affordable for all students. 🎓
05/12/23, 9:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely! Nobuhle, Your enthusiasm captures the essence perfectly. Edoofa's "Earn While You Learn" Program not only offers a remarkable funding model but also aligns with their commitment to providing invaluable real-world experience. It's a true win-win, empowering students to shape their education and future while making it accessible and affordable.
05/12/23, 9:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

05/12/23, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 708 8302: That's a great question! My parents and I have discussed how we'll be covering the cost of my education. I'm fortunate to have the support of my family, but I'm also aware that not all students have that same support system. So it's great that Edoofa is doing so much to make higher education more affordable. What's your opinion on this? Do you think it's important for universities to offer programs like these to help students from all backgrounds? 💭
05/12/23, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely! Your awareness of the varying support systems students have is spot on. Initiatives like Edoofa's, making education more affordable, are crucial for inclusivity. It ensures that students from diverse backgrounds can access higher education, breaking down financial barriers.
05/12/23, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Please address the question as well
05/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 708 8302: Ah yes, of course! In addition to the financial support of my family and the affordability initiatives of Edoofa, I am also a recipient of merit-based scholarships. These scholarships recognize my academic achievements and help to offset the cost of my education. I think it's fantastic that there are so many different ways for students to finance their education, from merit-based scholarships to need-based financial aid. It shows that higher education is valued and prioritized. What are your thoughts on merit-based scholarships?
05/12/23, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's truly commendable! Merit-based scholarships play a pivotal role in recognizing and supporting academic achievements. 

So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
05/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 78 708 8302: Yes, my family is very supportive of my decision to study abroad. They believe that it's a wonderful opportunity for me to experience a new culture and learn from a different education system. They also recognize the value of earning a degree from a prestigious university like Edoofa. I'm incredibly grateful for their support.
05/12/23, 10:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Nobuhle, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/12/23, 10:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
05/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 708 8302: You're absolutely right! Those are the essential components of a typical application for a university abroad. In addition to those items, students may also be asked to submit test scores from standardized exams like the TOEFL or IELTS, depending on the university's requirements. And of course, there's the financial aspect of applying, including the cost of tuition, room and board, and travel. Do you think there are any other important factors to consider when applying for university abroad? 🎓
05/12/23, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Nobuhle, Please note that in this scholarship program coming from South Africa, you don't need to have any submit test as IELTS or TOEFL
05/12/23, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
05/12/23, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
05/12/23, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
05/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 708 8302: This message was deleted
05/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 708 8302: This message was deleted
05/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 708 8302: Wow, a reduced enrollment fee is definitely a welcome development, considering the economic hardships many have faced due to the pandemic. And yes, I'd love to learn more about when and why the enrollment fee is paid. Please share this information with me, as it's very helpful to understand the entire process of applying to an international university.
05/12/23, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
05/12/23, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
05/12/23, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/12/23, 10:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
05/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 708 8302: This is incredibly useful information, and it's great to have a detailed breakdown of what the enrollment fee covers. The services offered through Edoofa are very valuable for students who are applying to universities abroad. I especially like the fact that the fee includes support for the entire process, from application to graduation. It's clear that Edoofa is dedicated to providing a comprehensive service for its students. What is the timeline for applying to universities abroad with Edoofa? 🗓️
05/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 708 8302: Wow, that's a very reasonable and flexible option! It's clear that Edoofa understands the economic challenges faced by many students and families, and is committed to making its services accessible to all. This option will be very helpful for students who may not be able to pay the full enrollment fee all at once. It's great to see such flexibility and understanding from a university application service.
05/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 708 8302: That's good
05/12/23, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Nobuhle, Please go through this for the timeline

05/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 708 8302: The Edoofa Cycle is a very useful visualization of the entire application and enrollment process. So far, we've discussed the Assessment stage and the Enrollment stage. It's clear that the entire process is very comprehensive, from assessment to enrollment to graduation. I appreciate the clear and transparent approach of the Edoofa Cycle. It's great to have all the steps laid out in such a clear and easy-to-understand way. Thank you for taking the time to walk me through this.
05/12/23, 11:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Nobuhle, I have asked you a one word question, Please answer accordingly
05/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 708 8302: 3
05/12/23, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
05/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 708 8302: Yes
05/12/23, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
05/12/23, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
