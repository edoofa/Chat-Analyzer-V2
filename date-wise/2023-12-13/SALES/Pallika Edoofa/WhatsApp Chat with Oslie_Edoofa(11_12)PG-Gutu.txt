11/12/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Mrs. Tsuro.
11/12/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
11/12/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As Oslie's evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate her interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
11/12/23, 7:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 453 2562: No I haven't
11/12/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 453 2562: I would like to hear from you.the opportunities,and the disadvantages if there are any
12/12/23, 12:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
12/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 453 2562: Good afternoon to you
12/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 453 2562: Earlier I had asked of the opportunities available after finishing the courses

12/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 453 2562: When I checked on your list of courses which you offer I didn't see medicine on it do you offer it to foreign students or it does have a different name.
12/12/23, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Tsuro, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Oslie does not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
