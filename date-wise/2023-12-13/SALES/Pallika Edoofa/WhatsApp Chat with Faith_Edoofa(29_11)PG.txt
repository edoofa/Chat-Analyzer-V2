I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - +27 62 156 4995: No problem
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - +27 62 156 4995: like as an example how much per month

04/12/23, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 2:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moyo, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity.
04/12/23, 2:17 pm - +27 62 156 4995: K l understand no problem

*Education is a Key to Success*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
07/12/23, 2:32 pm - +27 62 156 4995: Yeah
07/12/23, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Ms. Moyo?
07/12/23, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the results, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
07/12/23, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
07/12/23, 2:36 pm - +27 62 156 4995: I m fine and you
07/12/23, 2:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing great!
07/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 295 6767: Yes... I've researched the university of Cape town... I've always wanted to study in South Africa as it's closest to home
07/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 295 6767: I am confident that I will pass
07/12/23, 8:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 295 6767: Ok thank you I'll go through it
07/12/23, 9:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I was expecting a response from you and now My office hours are over here, Let us connect at *08:30 AM CAT (08/12/2023)* to resume your session (In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)

*What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*

In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.

 *What is it about?*

Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.

BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.
