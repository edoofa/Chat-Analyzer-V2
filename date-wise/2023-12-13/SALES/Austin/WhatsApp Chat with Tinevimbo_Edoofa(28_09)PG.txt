05/10/23, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*“The only way to have a life is to commit to it like crazy.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
05/10/23, 10:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tinevimbo, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
05/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Yes without a scholarship I read in that pdf you sent and they also did
05/10/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tinevimbo, please allow me to share it with you in detail.
05/10/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/10/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Without a scholarship they will not afford all those expenses ma'am
05/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 017 4619: I didn't understand I guess you mean wen one  get a scholarship the cost will be  reduced to $2000 - $3000 or can you please make me understand here ma'am Pallika
05/10/23, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinevimbo, That is correct, as you can see the cost of education in India without a scholarship ranges $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship and includes your Tuition, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, laundry etc
05/10/23, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have understood now.
05/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Oh okay I did understand it n they said they can afford it but let me ask on the fact that before I start anty I will be supposed to pay 1000_1500 the  first semester let me reask them on this
05/10/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tinevimbo, Also, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
05/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Oh yes you did told me the learn while you  work and earn is that it ma'am
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Exactly, The EWYL Program, Please let me explain you in detail.
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 2:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
05/10/23, 2:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
05/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 385 1373: Good after noon ma'am Pallika, on behalf of Tinevimbo I believe the Earn While You Learn program is a great opportunity for her to gain valuable work experience and supplement her income while pursuing her studies. If selected, she will benefit from developing new skills, gaining insights into her field of study, and earning additional income to support her academic goals. This program aligns well with her personal and professional development.
05/10/23, 3:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your perspective Ms. Simbisai, and sharing it on Tinevimbo's behalf.
05/10/23, 3:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, 

If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
05/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 385 1373: Oooh okay l get the sense  now it will be cheaper to us
05/10/23, 4:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed it is. <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 4:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
05/10/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 385 1373: I like all of them but I like the most is number 4 - Higher Education Concierge. I like this point because having a dedicated concierge or caretaker to guide my lil sister through the entire process of higher education is extremely valuable. Pursuing education abroad can otherwise feel quite overwhelming having to navigate different education systems, bureaucracies, paperwork, visa requirements etc alone. The concierge system ensures students have holistic support right from career counseling to identifying the right program/college, helping with applications, arranging travel, finding internships and training opportunities. This level of handholding gives peace of mind and allows one to solely focus on studies without worrying about logistical hurdles. A concierge also offers personalized attention which is important when making such crucial life decisions. Overall, the concierge approach makes the higher education journey smoother and more compliant through dedicated assistance, which is why I find it the most appealing aspect of Edoofa.
05/10/23, 7:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 385 1373: Thank you ma'am Pallika
05/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Thank you ma'am  🙏
06/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Yeah very True they're some students that are hard working .  To earn much like more than $1000 in  5 months this is beneficial . therefore my parents will be the one supporting my education
06/10/23, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
06/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Thank you ma'am in every step I'm keeping them updated and I am discussing with them.

Definitely    they are happy about a step I took and they are so proud and happy  for me and are looking forward to  hear from you
06/10/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinevimbo, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
06/10/23, 2:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
06/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Yes it is ma'am .
06/10/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Thank you for the opportunity ma'am to discuss this with me I'm honored 🙏
06/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Let me also check I have never applied before
06/10/23, 3:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed,

When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
06/10/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
06/10/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
06/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Yes I did understand so I want to ask that this fee will be payed on arrival to xool or I will pay it before without even knowing that am I accepted to any xool or
06/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Why is it paid
06/10/23, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
06/10/23, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Well understood thank you
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Stage 4 in the sense that we lastly discussed how the enrollment program  and discussed fees that  are needed to be payed and how it works .but the steps we take was on personalized counseling ma'am not knowing if what we were doing was an interview test maam😄
06/10/23, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Tinevimbo,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
06/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Yes ma'am
06/10/23, 3:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
06/10/23, 3:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
06/10/23, 3:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
06/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Olkay then I do understand ma'am .so what about traveling from here in Zimbabwe to India are there some cost I pay or who will be paying my ticket to travel abroad maam

08/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 017 4619: We discussed with my family about the scholarship for Edoofa scholarship program.And definitely yes we discussed that they will support me  through out till I'm done with this higher education offered by Edoofa scholarship program Sir  .I have talked on behalf of them because they are not on WhatsApp platform and the big sister of mine is not on internet for the mean time but she will be able to come join our discussion
08/10/23, 6:44 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session!

I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career. So may I know if your family has any queries, please

08/10/23, 6:53 pm - Austin: That is great to know!
08/10/23, 6:53 pm - Austin: So may I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
08/10/23, 7:02 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Looking at the cost of education it was  okay for them in the sense that looking and comparing with other higher education offered abroad like US and Canada this was much reasonable and affordable for them with also the learn while you earn program that will be helping me to earn scholarship credits it will be much easier for me and them.

Looking at the enrollment  fee they was a lack of understanding  it was mentioned that it will be $500_$750 registration fee this was it meaning to say after registering the course I have no more expenses on  the scholarship not counting the tution fees
08/10/23, 7:08 pm - Austin: Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wi-Fi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. Your intake is in August 2024
This cost can be further reduced by you through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While You Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
08/10/23, 7:08 pm - Austin: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$750) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from the University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family.
08/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Olkay Mr Austin meaning to say transportation from Zimbabwe to India if I manage to get a scholarship I and  my family will be responsible for paying the ticket fee n usually how much does it range from
08/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Well understood thank you
08/10/23, 7:24 pm - Austin: The ticket fee is around $450 from Zimbabwe and around $350 from SA
08/10/23, 7:25 pm - Austin: You are welcome, are you having other questions for me please?
08/10/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 017 4619: No sir I do understand   it sir I will have to update my family about this that was the question
08/10/23, 7:35 pm - Austin: Sure Tinevimbo!
Are you having other questions for me?
08/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 017 4619: No sir thank you for the session I'm sure my big sister when she comes online she will have some of the questions ❓ but as fore I'm satisfied .I did understand
08/10/23, 7:54 pm - Austin: This is well noted, Tinevimbo!
08/10/23, 7:54 pm - Austin: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
08/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 017 4619: Thank you olkay let me type it down
08/10/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 017 4619: This message was deleted
08/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 017 4619: My name is Tinevimbo Earnestine Moyo .I would love to study medical lab technology  with Edoofa program.

 Without a scholarship in India it's $6 000_$8 000

This program I will be studying it in India  . If found eligible a student will pay $2000 to $3000

The enrollment fee is $350 .it can be payed in 2 phases the first one $200 in 7 days and the remaining in  next 30 days.


The earn while you learn program therefore, is there to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Also it helps students to learn and develop the skills necessary for digital work space environment. 

On my own point of view I also see this Earn while you learn program helps students financially on supporting and boosting their scholarship program
08/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 017 4619: I think with the earn while you learn program  it Is most helpful to the students in the sense that    cost are reduced ,  also the students will be earning scholarship credits  this is very useful to every student .Also I understand that this earn while you learn program  student they don't earn the same therefore it depends with the way you work if you work hard you will earn more money.

09/10/23, 6:26 am - +263 78 017 4619: Greetings yes I'm clear about it Ms Pallika also mentioned it she explained to me.
