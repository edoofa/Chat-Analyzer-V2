So shall we continue with your process?

No problem, we may proceed
08/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
08/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 615 2641: Studying abroad gives me an opportunity to acquire more not only about the program I have selected to do but it allows me to learn more about other cultures around the world, just being exposed to a different environment promotes understanding other cultures, which is quite intriguing for me, it also boosts career prospects.

Studying abroad also gives me the chance to create a global network by giving me a chance to make new friends around the world.
08/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I had done some research actually and also the counselor told me a lot about it which also made my knowledge a little bit more concrete. No I had not applied to any other University abroad, I only contacted Edoofa
08/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I had done some research actually and also the counselor told me a lot about it which also made my knowledge a little bit more concrete. No I had not applied to any other University abroad, I only contacted Edoofa
08/12/23, 4:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
08/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I am aware that Edoofa can assist in covering between 50% to 80% of the costs which then leads to the costs being cut down to somewhere between $2000 - $3000 which will also be be partly tackled by the earn while you learn program hence it is very cost friendly
08/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
08/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
08/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

09/12/23, 10:19 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Jainos, Mr and Mrs Mugova @263786152641 @263772923584 @263772315491, How are you?

09/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 615 2641: Indeed we are sir, full time.
09/12/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
09/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I think I now fully understand this
09/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 615 2641: It is quite a great opportunity for students
09/12/23, 12:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now update you about the Earn While You Learn program?
09/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 615 2641: Ofcourse, no problem sir
09/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
09/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
09/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

09/12/23, 4:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
09/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 615 2641: Indeed it is sir, it is quite a unique trait that is not offered by any other University. A chance to sponsor your own higher education is just amazing, Ive never seen anything quite like it
09/12/23, 4:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
09/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 615 2641: This is the Edoofa cycle its basically the set of steps or stages that I will get through when getting my Application processed

In the first step, I have to receive proper information about the Edoofa program so that I understand the unique benefits and the value that Edoofa is doing for me

The second step is The Edoofa scholarship eligibility 
check is done and interview is taken by the Edoofa Board.
Once the I am found eligible by presenting their grades and performance in the interview, they are offered the chance of enrollment in the Edoofa program.

Then the third step is the Acceptance Letter from Edoofa, here if I manage to clear the Interview Process, I will then get accepted into our Program and get a scholarship Acceptance Letter from Edoofa.

The fourth Step involves finalizing my enrollment into the Edoofa Program by completing the Edoofa Enrollment fees of $200-$350. 
Once the I pay the enrollment fee, Edoofa helps in generating the 
 Admission Acceptance Letter(AAL) from the University/college as well as the *Visa letter* which Edoofa also helps in mailing to the Indian High Commission in the particular country for the purpose of Visa processing. 

The Fifth Stege, once the enrollment is completed, I will rely on the full-fledged 
support provided by our Admission Officers. 
 
At this stage,  I will start to participate in the Earn While You Learn Program and start earning at an early stage.

Once the university sessions are over, I will then secure the Admission offer letter  from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation and then i will confirm my admission within a stipulated time frame.

In the Sixth Stege Edoofa helps in generating the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL)from the University as well as the *Visa application letter.* 
Edoofa also guides in the mailing process to the Indian High Commission in the particular country for the purpose of Visa processing. 
All the necessary help and information regarding the Visa process will be provided by the Edoofa Admission officers at this stage.

Then last but not least is stage 7.By this time when the I complete the Admission formalities and Visa Processes, it is time for the transition journey from my home country(Zimbabwe) to India.
 Upon arrival at the Airport, The Edoofa team will be there to take me to my respective Top Ranking Universities of India.
This is my basic understanding of the image
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
09/12/23, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This message was deleted
09/12/23, 5:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you understand better now?
09/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 615 2641: Yess sir, clearly, thank you for the enlightenment
09/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
09/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
09/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
09/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
09/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
09/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
09/12/23, 6:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected?
09/12/23, 7:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

11/12/23, 9:58 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Jainos, Mr and Mrs Mugova @263786152641 @263772923584 @263772315491, How are you?
11/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 615 2641: Well, I think all of the above mentioned points are all very interesting and make Edoofa the ultimate higher education organization above all, the career counselling point on the other hand and the affordability are the points that grabbed my attention the most, it is quite splendid that a student is given guidance on their career path to help them understand it better, I think this reduces uncertainty out of the minds of students and make them confident about their craft.
11/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 615 2641: Okay no problem i will be here
11/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 615 2641: Morning Mr Shubham we are all well how are you?
11/12/23, 11:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
11/12/23, 11:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
11/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 615 2641: Indeed sir, I am
11/12/23, 11:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
11/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 615 2641: Indeed you did sir that is quite an advantage for every Edoofa affiliated student
11/12/23, 1:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
11/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 615 2641: I understand sir this is quite beneficial for the students
11/12/23, 1:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted please
11/12/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
11/12/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
11/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 615 2641: So soon after being accepted the 350 must be paid with immediate effect?
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/12/23, 4:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
11/12/23, 4:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
11/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 231 5491: That's good for the parents, they won't feel burdened in raising the money.
11/12/23, 4:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so I have an assignment for you, No need to panic as the answers to every question is resting in this chat itself, so make sure if you don't know the answer find it from the chat and then write it down

1.      Edoofa's vision and benefits if you're eligible?


2.      Cost of Education in India and the course which you're applying for and Why do we recommend India for higher education?


3.      Enrollment Fee payment timeline including the deadline period and how much to pay,  and when you've to pay?
11/12/23, 4:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Please answer these questions correctly to proceed towards the next step*
11/12/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 231 5491: Wonderful it's good that Edoofa is considerate.
11/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 615 2641: Alright no problem
11/12/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 615 2641: 1.  Edoofa would greatly benefit me through the affordability, it will reduce the financial burden on my higher education.
It also gives me an opportunity to fund my higher education through scholarship credits earned through the earn while you learn program
It also helps me to acquire high quality education at the same time providing experience in the field

2. Normally the cost of education in India would be around $8000 annually but Edoofa provides 50%-80% which cuts down the costs to between $2000 to $3000 annually.
The course I want to venture in is Bachelors in Computer Science.
India is a great recommendation because it is home to some of the most successful people around the world, its universities and degrees are also recognized globally. The EWYL program also makes me very marketable on the job market.

3.The enrollment fee is $350 and due to economic instability in Africa parents are allowed to complete 200USD within 7 days then the other 150USD can be paid in 30days
11/12/23, 5:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Excellent, Attempt, Let me sum it up for you. So that you are clear with all the information
11/12/23, 5:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1.Well Edoofa Scholarship Program is an innovative program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. under the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative that solves the problems of Affordability and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to Earn Scholarship Credits and Learn 21st century job skills. Through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, Edoofians are provided 50-100% scholarships to study their dream courses alongside working on live projects that help them earn scholarship credits. We help African students in self-financing their Education.
In short, The Edoofa Program, through the SEELS initiative, is bridging the gap between Financial Aid, College Education and Employability.
11/12/23, 5:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. For the selected students who are able to qualify for the *EDOOFA Program* by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to *$2000-$3000* per year. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
11/12/23, 5:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. let me tell you dear the *enrollment fee* was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
11/12/23, 5:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

Section 5

 16 years after the devastating genocide that took place in Rwanda, the country has made significant progress in rebuilding and healing. However, there are still many challenges facing the nation, and the scars of the genocide remain.
In 1994, Rwanda was torn apart by a brutal genocide that left an estimated 800,000 people dead. The violence was sparked by decades of ethnic tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. The majority Hutu government encouraged the killing of Tutsis, and many ordinary people joined in the violence.
In the years since the genocide, Rwanda has made great strides in rebuilding. The government has worked to promote
While Rwanda has made progress in many areas, there are still challenges facing the country. One major issue is the need for continued economic development. Although Rwanda's economy has grown in recent years, poverty remains a serious problem. In addition, the country faces environmental challenges, such as deforestation and soil erosion.
Another major challenge is dealing with the legacy of the genocide. The memory of the violence is still raw for many Rwandans, and reconciliation efforts have been ongoing. The government has worked to promote unity and tolerance through education and other means. However, some critics say that the government has been too heavy-handed in its approach, and some say that the government has suppressed opposition and restricted freedom of speech. In addition, many genocide survivors are still struggling with trauma, and the country faces a shortage of qualified mental health professionals.
Despite these challenges, Rwanda has come a long way in the last 16 years. The country has made progress in promoting peace and reconciliation, and it has become a regional leader in development and economic growth. There is still much work to be done, but the people of Rwanda are resilient and determined to build a better future.

Section6.

I was born with something in me that forced me not to settle for anything average, it was always tough considering that I was born in a country with a low economic status, however, this does not mean that I gave up, I remained patient but thirsty for greatness even up to this day knowing that my time shall come. I have always been a person who associates well with other people around, I have always been a team player, this is the reason why I enjoy playing Basketball, its a sport that requires you to depend upon your mates and to be dependable at the same time. Beginning this sport, I was never a naturally talented person but I worked hard up to the state were i was able to play, This is basically how my entire life has always been, I face a lot of obstacles and discouragements but quiting or complaining has never been an option, i have always preferred to work against the odds.
I am  and have always been an optimistic person, and a confident and courageous person, which are some of the qualities of a leader. My mission growing even up to this day has always been to help other people who are in need. I have great sympathy for the less fortunate and I'd really love to offer assistance to make the world a better place. Also to help people who have taken the wrong paths in like, for example the path of drugs and crime, i realize that in most cases it is not their fault but rather they are forced into those positions through some curtain circumstances and I have always wanted to take the role of spreading awareness and assist them to desist from such life. 
Most people who know me would say I am too ambitious, i am a person with big dreams and an even bigger imagination, i believe that we can achieve literally anything if we can put our mind to it.
