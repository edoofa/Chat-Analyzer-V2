*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Kudzaishe?*
16/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 543 8646: I saw that Edoofa is a good and different university compared to the universities that we have here in Zimbabwe. It has safe and welcoming environment and high quality education compared to our universities that we have in Zimbabwe. It also shows that Edoofa moulded the behaviour of the students as it stated that it involves parents and be punctual to schedule of your counsellor . I also understood that Edoofa has an affordablilty tuition and it offers high quality education than our universities that we have here . Edoofa offers both scholarship and Sponsorship but it only gives scholarships to the previledges but those who cannot afford Scholarship may get Sponsorship

I am Mr Shubham, The Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa. 

I am here to discuss the application of Simeon

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
20/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 314 6326: Good morning. 

It's my pleasure having conversation with you.

Of recently I have heard that there is a scholarship program called Edoofa that is assisting students to study in India.
20/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
20/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
20/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Thank yu giving me more information about Edoofa. I'm now enlightened.
20/11/23, 12:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

*United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High*, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s,*Shalom Academy*, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Great news.
20/11/23, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mrs Tinotenda Wamedzwa
I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
20/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Tru that. I'm a holder of Bachelor of Commerce Honors Degree in Finance from National University of Science and Technology 2013. I'm currently working as an Audit Clerk at Binga Rural District Council. .

Considering the current educational systems we are having in Zimbabwe, i would be very happy for Simeon to study abroad as he will be able to explore a lot into his career provided adequate resources are availed to him as we lack resources hence enhanced accademic experience.
Studying abroad will assist in making better decision as one will be having a seen HOW OTHERS ARE DOING THINGS  thus unlocking new greater possibilities that we are not realizing today in our community. 
Studing abroad will also enhance personal growth and gives an expanded cultural awareness.
20/11/23, 3:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mrs Tinotenda Wamedzwa*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

I believe that is exactly what you are looking forward to from the program for *Simeon*, right?
20/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Indeed
20/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now *Simeon*, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

*Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way*
20/11/23, 6:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

21/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 543 8646: My name is Simeon Wamedzwa. I am a gentleman aged twenty-two  . I am currently studying my Advanced level (Lower 6). I completed my ordinary level in 2022 and I obtained six subjects. These subjects include English language, History, Heritage studies, Shona, Commerce and Family and Religious Studies.                        I want to be a journalist. I have got my own parents but unfortunately my father died when I was young and my mother is a single mother and she's not working .                 My guardian who is my sister in law is a audit clerk and she is currently working at Binga Rural District Council. Her highest education level it's Tertiary level. She is the one who is responsible for my fees , welfare  and all necessities. My sister in law would be responsible for my Tertiary level .                      I have five elder brothers and two young brothers. The two young brothers are still learning to a certain school in rural areas, however, the other five are not gainfully employed since they have failed to reach better level in their fields due to financial constraints.            Currently, I am a student at Binga High School in Matabeleland  North, province. I am doing Literature in English, History and Family and Religious Studies

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
22/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 543 8646: I once was a student at Chipendeke Secondary School in Masvingo province from 2016 upto 2019. This is school is located under Bikita District and it is in rural areas. But unfortunately,I failed to pass since I used to walk a long distance to school . This meant that I had not enough time to study. This school helped me to be a better person in the community and at school since we used to have guidance and counselling sessions with the elders of the community and other senior teachers who were incharge of shaping and moulding the students' behaviour. There after I appointed as a senior prefect in 2018 where I targeted at shaping the behaviour of the juniors and other fellow students.            In 2019, I joined volleyball and Netball club where  I trained as a coach . There after I decided to repeat my Ordinary level last year.                In 2022 , I decided to join scripture union,drug and abuse compaign as well as cleaning up compaign at Binga High School. I did this because I had greater understanding on dangers of taking drugs ,promoting good hygiene at school and many more. This made me to be a good student and to be popular in the community and at school.

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

I also want to build good relationships with many people from different places as well as to travel and experience new places and cultures. Additionally, journalism can be a very rewarding career for me , since it would cultivates the spirit of patriotism. It also enables me to be more vexed with the current affairs.

05/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 543 8646: Yes
05/12/23, 5:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
05/12/23, 5:19 pm - +263 71 543 8646: Yes am sure I will going to have better points
05/12/23, 6:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

07/12/23, 4:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation. Till then please take care.

08/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
08/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 71 543 8646: It's because I would get an opportunity to get job after studying my course as compared to my country, I can get an opportunity to work outside the country as I compared with my country since there is high rate of unemployment. I want to create relationship and friendship with different people,I also want to improve my English command as I would socialise with different people with different languages. The other reason is education level ,we are now used to learn our native things so I would like to change that system . It also give me an opportunity to experience some new cultures and learn about the ways of life. It provide the chance to improve language skills and endede up building strong communication with different people.  Studying abroad gives me a great chance to experience the standard of living . Studying abroad lead to personal growth and developments ,as it often requires students to step outside of their comfort zone and learn to adapt to a new environment. Lastly to travel and explore a new  part of world.
08/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 543 8646: No accept Edoofa
08/12/23, 1:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
08/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 543 8646: No
08/12/23, 1:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
08/12/23, 1:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
08/12/23, 1:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

11/12/23, 6:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
12/12/23, 10:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
12/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 314 6326: Morning Ma'am. We are out of power for the past 2 days and the network is very bad. Great apologies   for not responding the massage yesterday. Simeon is not reachable at the moment due to the factors I have highlighted above. He is making all necessary efforts to get in touch with you.

12/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Yes
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 314 6326: May you shed more light on the Earn While You Learn Program
12/12/23, 2:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Surely, Let me explain the same in detail
12/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
12/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Thank you Sir for the explanation.
12/12/23, 2:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

12/12/23, 2:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
12/12/23, 2:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

12/12/23, 2:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

12/12/23, 4:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
12/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Yes. The best thing I value is to get work related experience and a number of channels that will open my mind to the international world. Getting to know how  things are done in some countries is the best exposure that I'm interested in.
12/12/23, 4:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 4:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me?
12/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 314 6326: It's the Edoofa Cycle which shows the major steps that  are done for a person to be admitted into the Edoofa. The first stage being that of professional Counseling session. I understand this is the stage which we are right now. After that will be on the second stage of Eligibility Check and interview. 
If one  passes the stage he/she will then be accepted into the Edoofa program on stage 3. The forth stage is now enrolment into the Edoofa. And the admissions process starts on stage 5 . Finally if all goes well one will be given the admissions letter and Vissa to go and study in India through the Edoofa program. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
12/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
12/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
12/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
12/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
12/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
12/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
12/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/12/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Thank you Sir for the information. It's very useful
12/12/23, 4:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:

1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
12/12/23, 4:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
12/12/23, 4:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
12/12/23, 4:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
12/12/23, 4:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?

12/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 314 6326: These have helped me to be guided in my career choice. Earn while Yu learn helps me to reduce financial burden on my guidians as well as giving me exposure and work related experience.
12/12/23, 6:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
12/12/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 314 6326: No you didn't elaborate on what.
12/12/23, 7:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
12/12/23, 7:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:
