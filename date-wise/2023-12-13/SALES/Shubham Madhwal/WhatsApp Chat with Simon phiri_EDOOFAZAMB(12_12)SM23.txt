Yes Iam
12/12/23, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with John Pellser?*
12/12/23, 11:25 am - +260 770891519: .
What motivated me was my friend John Pellser because I was complaining to him to say I want to do my tertiary education unfortunately my parents have no funds to do so for me he responded to say there is this institution I think it might help you because am sure they can find you a place or someone to sponsor you on your journey of education you want to go on then he shared a link to me so I did my research and Iam here still seeking help
12/12/23, 12:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail
12/12/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*

So are we good to begin your session?
12/12/23, 12:21 pm - +260 770891519: .
Yes
12/12/23, 12:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*. In case they are not available right now they can still be a part of the group and catch up with the conversations later.

*Please let me know once you have added them*
