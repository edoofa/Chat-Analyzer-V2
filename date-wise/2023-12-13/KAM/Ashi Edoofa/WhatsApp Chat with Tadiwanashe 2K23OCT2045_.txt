02/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
02/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/11/23, 12:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
02/11/23, 12:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
02/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I am following
02/11/23, 12:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
02/11/23, 12:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/11/23, 12:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
02/11/23, 12:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.

03/11/23, 11:34 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe, Wishing you all a great day!

I wanted to follow up regarding the videos that were shared with you yesterday. Were you able to review all four of them? I am keen to discuss them further and would greatly appreciate your feedback.
03/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I reviewed all of them . They were pretty inspiring
03/11/23, 1:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
03/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I would be happy to
03/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 161 5241: First of all EDOOFA not only makes tertiary education affordable but teaches students to be independent and provides life transforming opportunities. In the first video the co founders also said EDOOFA also looks for students who can go an extra mile , follow instructions and who are open minded. I also liked the Steve Jobs example
03/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263781615241 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
03/11/23, 1:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
03/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 161 5241: The visions of EDOOFA are to make students employamble, education affordableand increase the capacity of a student's success through guidance, counseling and the EWYL program. The co founders also said the attitude of a student also contributes to capacity of success
03/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 161 5241: EDOOFA also have experience and indentifieď  some university and colleges which provide good education accommodation and social life for the student
03/11/23, 1:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
03/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 161 5241: On the SOP the co founders also said that it is a form that create good first impression to the director of certain universities. They said a student must provide vision for choosing that university or college also sharing some past experiences
03/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
03/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
03/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
03/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I agree and also well understood
03/11/23, 1:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
03/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes we are on the same page
03/11/23, 1:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
03/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay I can do that
03/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 161 5241: So where are the forms thaat the co-founder said you should send me
03/11/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, dear I am sharing the forms with you
03/11/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
03/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 161 5241: This message was deleted
03/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Tomorrow at 1000 AM

In reference to our discussion, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?

04/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 161 5241: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (7-Nov-2023).
04/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/CxC40ZceoYvIdl596WfAGc
04/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Tadiwanashe Gomendo, and my EWYL group name is Tadiwanashe EWYL23E0879. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (7-Nov-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.* <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
04/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes
04/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 161 5241: My surname is miswritten it should be Gomendo . Is tha a problem
04/11/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me @263781615241, let me correct it.
04/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay thanks 😊
04/11/23, 3:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes it is accurate
04/11/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/11/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/11/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/11/23, 3:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes
04/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes we discussed about ir
04/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes were are on the same page
04/11/23, 6:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
04/11/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
04/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I get it
06/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 161 5241: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Mrs Aditi and she has scheduled my session for 07 November 2023
06/11/23, 11:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe, I hope you are doing well. 

It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi, and that a session has been scheduled for tomorrow. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
06/11/23, 11:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to your journey, I would like to ask if you are available for the discussion, Could you please share your response?
06/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Thank you for the wishes
06/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes for a moment
06/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263781615241, I am glad to know that you are available for the session now.
06/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With respect to our last conversation, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
06/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000 = $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $400 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
06/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay so when can I expect my offer letter
06/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay thats good
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see your excitement for your offer letter, once we will complete our session today we will apply your application and soon you will receive the good news regarding offer letter.
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
06/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 161 5241: That is fair
06/11/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 161 5241: For now there are no queries
06/11/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
06/11/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
06/11/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
06/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes my family is always excited for my education
06/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are extremely happy to hear that Tadiwanashe. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
06/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
06/11/23, 4:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781615241 May I know if you have taken a note of above messages?
06/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 358 4677: When is this registration fee needed
06/11/23, 5:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263773584677, Let me share regarding the registration fees, Once you'll receive Tadiwanashe's offer letter and decide the university where he wants to pursue his Higher Education, then you need to make a payment. However, we'll discuss regarding this in our upcoming session. May I kindly know if we can proceed?
06/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 358 4677: Yes
06/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
06/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/11/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
06/11/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
06/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 358 4677: Yes I have
06/11/23, 5:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
06/11/23, 5:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
06/11/23, 5:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tadiwanashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his seat before the competition even begins. He will be the trailblazer among his peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
06/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781615241 @263773584677 I was looking forward to receiving your response, but since I haven't received a message, I wanted to follow up and see if we are still connected and if you have taken a note of above messages?

Your timely response is valuable to us, as it will enable us to move forward with our planned discussions.
06/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I have taken note of the above
06/11/23, 7:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/11/23, 7:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/11/23, 7:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes it really resonates. Edoofa has more services than I thought
06/11/23, 7:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850.
06/11/23, 7:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I understand
06/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes it is
06/11/23, 7:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/11/23, 7:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/11/23, 7:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I have followed
06/11/23, 7:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 161 5241: I would like you to provide more information
06/11/23, 7:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 7:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 7:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
06/11/23, 7:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
06/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I see that
06/11/23, 7:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
06/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes they won't
06/11/23, 7:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
06/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I agree
06/11/23, 7:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
06/11/23, 7:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
06/11/23, 7:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I am clear
06/11/23, 7:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
06/11/23, 7:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I am clear
06/11/23, 7:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
06/11/23, 7:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/11/23, 7:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 161 5241: No questions yet
06/11/23, 8:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
06/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes very excited
06/11/23, 8:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
06/11/23, 8:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
06/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Thank you very much
06/11/23, 8:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263781615241, Have a good day ahead and please extend our warm regards to your family.
06/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay have a nice day too
06/11/23, 8:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263781615241

17/11/23, 11:40 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay now I understand
18/11/23, 7:13 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tadiwanashe, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

I am glad to hear that please don't worry about your offer letter, we will share it soon once we received the letter from the University officials, Your patience are highly appreciated.
18/11/23, 8:18 am - +263 78 161 5241: Morning how are you... okay we will be pat

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Quest Group of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
27/11/23, 10:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

27/11/23, 10:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 7:46 am - +263 78 161 5241: Evening how are you
28/11/23, 7:47 am - +263 78 161 5241: Okay 0200 PM we will be available

I am good, thank you for asking. Let us plan to reconnect in the afternoon at 02:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion.
28/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Afternoon how are you
28/11/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes really excited
28/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I have gone through it thoroughly
28/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 161 5241: 1200 USD per annum as tuition fee
Accommodation ranges from 750 to 1000 USD
The registration feee is 730 USD
28/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me correct you here please that your registration fees is $750. Moving ahead, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1200.
						–
Along with this, there is a $100 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your uniform fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1200, the total comes out to be $1300.
28/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay thanks for the correction I now get it
28/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263781615241, Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1300  + $500 = $1800. I hope you are clear about this?
28/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes it is clear
28/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 161 5241: I have one issue though
28/11/23, 2:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please share your issue with us @263781615241
28/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 161 5241: My name is wrongly written it should be Gomendo Tadiwanashe
28/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 161 5241: And 1 quick question. Do I expect any other offer letters or this is the final one
28/11/23, 2:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for highlighting the error in the offer letter, Let me share the same with the team. Moving forward regarding your concern, I would like to inform you that this is the first letter we have received, you might get more offer letters from other universities in the future.
28/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 161 5241: The future like how long interms of duration
28/11/23, 2:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear as you know that the offer letter are processed by the university, hence we are not able to share the dedicated timeline with you. However, I would like to emphasize that we should concentrate on this offer letter now.
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay thanx for the empasis
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes it is crystal clear
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263781615241. Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1800 - $1000 = $800 which will have to be paid by your parents at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yaah it really reduces most financial burden
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $750 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1800 - $750 = $1050. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
28/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes it is clear
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.  Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 11th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay what about that Endowment Grant
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263781615241. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
28/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes that will be great
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 11th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 11th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *December 11th, 2023*.

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes we are
28/11/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/11/23, 3:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 161 5241: My father stays in Harare me I am in Chipinge
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay thanx
28/11/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
28/11/23, 3:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
28/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Okay yes that will be great
28/11/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
28/11/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 161 5241: There is one question. If the registration fee is payed and another offer letter comes will it be possible to change the university
28/11/23, 4:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
28/11/23, 4:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I understand that
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.

As of now, your application has been only accepted by the *Quest Group of Institutions* and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Quest, you would lose out on the scholarship from Quest and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 161 5241: I was not aware but sounds like it is great
28/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781615241 Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with *Quest Group of Institutions* by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at *Quest Group of Institutions* without risking losing out on the scholarship.
28/11/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to *Quest* to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Quest, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 4:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
28/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 161 5241: That is perfect
28/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes now I understand
28/11/23, 4:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that @263781615241, Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 161 5241: For now there are none . We can proceed
28/11/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In that case, let me also tell you a bit about the Quest Group of institutions. It is the most ideal destination for international students interested in studying in India. They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
						
It has a Unique Mentorship program to encourage students to do well according to their abilities and strengths and has been awarded Outstanding Technical Institution of North India during the World Education Summit and Awards.
28/11/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Quest Group of Institutions is approved by the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), the statutory body for Technical Education under the Ministry of HRD, Govt. of India. It is affiliated with IKG Punjab Technical University, which is a Govt. University ranked amongst the top public universities in India.

28/11/23, 4:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by Friday at 2:00 PM and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Quest University as a collective?

02/12/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, With this I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Quest Group of Institutions  as a collective? <This message was edited>

02/12/23, 2:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
02/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 161 5241: It was not tha much efficient because we were talking on the phone but It was worth it . We are ready to proceed except for the due dates of payments
02/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. As you have mentioned that you have some concern with the due dates for payment, Could you please shed more light on the same?
02/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 161 5241: My dad was concerned about the dates being to close with little bit less time to prepare
02/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your point dear, but as you know that the idle timeline is 15 days as per the university if someone wants to secure their seat with the university however since you are enrolled through Edoofa and we are aware of the challenges that parents face since these are not new challenges, parents go through them frequently this is the reason why we have meetings with the universities and came up with the Endowment Program which was discussed with you.
02/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you remember the same.
02/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Yes I remember
02/12/23, 2:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that dear, as you shared that the that the university's due date of 15 days for payment is too short, I understand that raising the required funds might be challenging and to address the same, Edoofa has taken a proactive step to assist you by granting the Endowment Benefits. These benefits not only allow you to save $150 on the registration fee but also extend the payment period to 45 days.
02/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Given this additional time, I would like to understand your expectations regarding the due date, considering the universities have already helped you with the same.
02/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 161 5241: I think we will try to make it
02/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate your positive thoughts dear, however in future if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter please do not hesitate to share it with us. <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
02/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Not that much research
02/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
02/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.

Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
02/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 161 5241: The $300 installment
02/12/23, 2:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
02/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 161 5241: Not sure about that for now I will update you maybe tomorrow

With respect to the discussion that we had here earlier, you were planning to make the payment of your registration fee by 11th December, however, I have not received an update from your side on that.

Now, can you please let me know if you are done with the payment so that I can share the same information with the university officials?
11/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 358 4677: Facing challenges at work we used to be paid in half united states dollars and half Zimbabwe dollars but now due to economy challenges company facing they are paying us in Zimbabwe dollars then to get the united states dollars you have to go to the streets money changer with higher rates.now to get 100usd is equivalent to 1.200.000 Zimbabwe dollars
11/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 358 4677: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern with us @263773584677, I understand where you are coming from.
