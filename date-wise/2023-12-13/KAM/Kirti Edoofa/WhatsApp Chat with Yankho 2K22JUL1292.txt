18/07/22, 3:40 pm - You were added
12/09/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Yankho,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Yankho's higher education?
12/09/23, 2:45 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Yes we are all fine here. How about you and and EDOOFA family? Iam Yankho's mother but Yankho is not on this forum please add him. As a single parent to Yankho Nyoni, I have been using government salary for school fees and my salary is less than 300 dollars of which we also use for our daily life and care for my mother (grand mother to Yankho) who is suffering from stroke to the point that she can't walk for 5 years now. Yankho has indeed finished his exams in end July and he is just waiting for the Malawi School Certificate examination results which Iam hoping them to be out by next month October, 2023.Since his secondary school fees was above my earning salary, I took a loan for him to finish his studies and now Iam still paying back the loan using my monthly salary. Thanks that you are ready but to our side because of what I have earlier explained, it can be difficult for us if university application process will require finances as of now. Thank you
19/10/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Yankho.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
19/10/23, 6:26 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Good evening to you too. I have understood your absence and let me write here that Iam available now as a parent to Yankho Nyoni but tomorrow Iam committed as we are hosting the Malawi President in our Agriculture Development Division (ADD) on affordable input programme launch of this season.
19/10/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your schedule with me, it is duly noted. Before we start, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

19/10/23, 9:06 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: We have not yet received hard copy certificates from Malawi National Examinations Board but allow me to search for the one Chaminade Marianist secondary school sent to us parents

19/10/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can share his number, and I shall add him tomorrow in the group.

20/10/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 10:05 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: I remember well about the discussion we had on registration process of university admission but I mentioned my financial challenges as of now
20/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
20/10/23, 11:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
21/10/23, 4:53 am - +265 888 77 70 30: I appreciated your kind heart to help me recall and understand the process of admission process. Sorry that I failed to respond to you on what you wrote yesterday. This is because I fell asleep around past 10pm last night. I know it can look awkward to do that but on that Thursday I went to bed late after 12pm and wake up again before 3am . With the work we had yesterday the whole day I was very tired. I thought I would make it to connect to you but I failed. Sorry for that. We are more than ready to be assisted please don't get tired of us. As you have said please provide to me the detailed breakdown of summary of the process. Once again forgive us for not responding to your words.
21/10/23, 5:01 am - +265 888 77 70 30: I was supposed to respond indeed but the reason is what I have indicated earlier. Thanks for your tirelessness to help people like us. Let me take this opportunity to assure you that I will be available today even at 8:30 am. Thanks for wishing me a good evening yesterday.
21/10/23, 8:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Yankho,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 8:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I completely understand that work can be tiring and you might have fallen asleep because of that, also I have granted you the admin, please go ahead and add Yankho to the group.
21/10/23, 8:45 am - +265 888 77 70 30: The same good day to you too. I also thank you for allowing me to be an admin.
21/10/23, 8:45 am - +265 888 77 70 30: Today I am available as per promise
21/10/23, 8:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, I am glad to hear that you are available to connect with us now.
21/10/23, 8:47 am - +265 888 77 70 30: Yes Iam available only that I received a call that's why I did not connect to you in time
21/10/23, 8:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, could you please add Yankho, and also share the JCE results clearer picture as discussed?
21/10/23, 8:51 am - +265 888 77 70 30: I am going to add him but we are still waiting for the Principal to give us the results. With the MSCE results it was not difficult because of the current situation as they are using the smart school app and they put examination report/ results there.
21/10/23, 8:52 am - +265 888 77 70 30: We are grad He has sent the results now
21/10/23, 8:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I shall wait for your response to the results

21/10/23, 9:24 am - +265 888 77 70 30: Yes I remember well the past discussion we had on university admission
21/10/23, 9:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 9:53 am - +265 888 77 70 30: Alright. Thanks
21/10/23, 9:59 am - +265 888 77 70 30: Our discussion was that after we start with our university admission process, the university would take a few days of time to evaluate the application for a scholarship after which they would release the scholarship offer letter and to reserve the student  seat with the University then we are supposed to complete university registration formalities by making a payment of $500 to $750 depending upon the university.
21/10/23, 10:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 11:02 am - +265 888 77 70 30: Thanks for you response. Truly my concern is about finances. I have no one to help me from our family because Iam a bread winner to our family and I also care about my mother who can't walk due to stroke problem. Our currency is keeping on devaluating so the registration fee can be huge amount.  I depend on little salary for a living.
21/10/23, 11:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern, however, as we move ahead your concern shall be answered and we have an exciting news to share as well.
21/10/23, 11:26 am - +265 888 77 70 30: I don't know how to thank EDOOFA for this kind of support. Much appreciated.
21/10/23, 11:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
21/10/23, 11:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
21/10/23, 11:33 am - +265 888 77 70 30: Thank you very much.  This is to the best of our knowledge. It is exactly what we applied for
21/10/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
21/10/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
21/10/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
21/10/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
21/10/23, 1:07 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Apology: I was out to the field because one of our mega farmers requested me to visit his farm and assist him with plant health problem diagnosis but now Iam going home I have seen the above documents  and I will go through them
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I shall wait for your response.
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Thanks alot you are most welcome
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Noted
21/10/23, 1:09 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: This is duly noted
21/10/23, 1:11 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: This can not be possible to study at multiple universities.
21/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
21/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
21/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
21/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
21/10/23, 2:10 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Yes please.I will respond soon after arriving home possibly 10 minutes
21/10/23, 2:52 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Thanks much for the direction we need to take
21/10/23, 2:53 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Noted and clear
21/10/23, 2:58 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Iam home now but because your hours are Over. We will reconnect on Monday. Thanks
23/10/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Yankho,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
23/10/23, 2:50 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Good day to you too.
23/10/23, 2:50 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Iam available
23/10/23, 2:51 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Let's discuss about university admission now
23/10/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far
23/10/23, 3:22 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Thanks. Iam Abit clear because our proud counsellor mentioned about this earlier back but can you come again on what you have said that the paid registration fee is adjusted reducing it to zero though you have said for the ordinary registration this fee is an additional cost while with Edoofians it is part of the first year tution fee.
23/10/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I am happy to hear that you are clear so far. That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
23/10/23, 3:39 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Well understood. Thanks for the clarification
23/10/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
23/10/23, 3:57 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: It is clear
23/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
23/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
23/10/23, 4:04 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Alright.  Thanks
23/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
23/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
23/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

15/11/23, 5:44 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Noted
15/11/23, 5:47 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 5:48 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: 2. The standard duration of the course is 5 years ( 10 semesters)
15/11/23, 5:50 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: 1. The tution fee after scholarship is USD 900 per semester
15/11/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response, to all the questions.
15/11/23, 5:54 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: 3. The admission and procedure is USD 300.
15/11/23, 5:54 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: My phone is misbehaving I don't know if it's network problem
15/11/23, 5:55 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Let me write the last question
15/11/23, 5:56 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: 4.Registration fee is USD 750
15/11/23, 5:56 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: I hope I have answered all the questions. Thanks
15/11/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that you can reply to the questions as per your convenience. Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 5:59 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Understood. Thanks
15/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 6:03 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Thanks for this guidance
15/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 6:09 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Nice conversation. Thanks
15/11/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 6:10 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Loud and clear
15/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 6:11 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Much appreciated
15/11/23, 6:12 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Iam listening to you
15/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 6:14 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Yes I can remember well
15/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 6:17 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Last time you said second payment in January not December
15/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. That was the tuition fee upon Yankho's arrival in India, here we are right now talking about the registration fee
15/11/23, 6:19 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Thanks
15/11/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
15/11/23, 6:28 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: I have never used the visa but last time I used through my bank account
15/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please in that case, you can inform us one day prior when you are going to make the payment please.
15/11/23, 6:38 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: I will see if I can afford to pay the registration fee because we are currently facing a challenge of devaluation in our country especially when the university offer letter has taken some days because it was previously 1USD to 1180 Malawi Kwacha but now three days ago it is 1USD to 1700 MK and my salary with this devaluation is USD 236 per month - less than the required part payment. We are in trouble
15/11/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265888777030 thank you for sharing your concern with us transparently please do not worry, we shall definitely assist you here, however, before we get to your concern let us discuss the offer letter in detail so that you have a better understanding of the university, right?
15/11/23, 6:40 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Noted
15/11/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the message above?
15/11/23, 6:44 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Thanks much. Yes I have read the above message
15/11/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing,  now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 6:49 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Clear
15/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: This is a brilliant idea which is of much help to us
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 6:59 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Yes it is indeed affordable the only problem is our country
15/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 7:03 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Thanks so much
15/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. May I know if you were able to go through the message above?
15/11/23, 7:08 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: My question is on out campus accommodation with self cooking facility. Is the student going search for food on his own?
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please let me help you understand our Edoofians, prefer off-campus accommodation since it is more cheaper and allows them the freedom to cook for themselves in the kitchen provided.
15/11/23, 7:14 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Alright. Thanks
15/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

18/11/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
20/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Yankho!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 1:03 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Good afternoon to you too. Surely I shared the offer letter from Galgotias University with family members. They appreciated what has happened to us
20/11/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 1:46 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Exactly. They are all excited but the problem is what explained earlier on about financial constraints. That time I said Iam a bread winner for my family and apart from this Iam also caring about my sick elderly mother  who is suffering from stroke disease. I disclosed my salary and it too little for education abroad. My family is asking if there can be another chance for another scholarship to add on this 50% Edoofa scholarship because even Yankho can do EWYL programme still it will not be affordable to us but thanks for all the effort you are doing to help us.
20/11/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me I was occupied with a meeting, so I was not able to get back to you. I am sorry to hear that and I understand that you have financial constraints and taking proper care of your mother is also a big responsibility being the only breadwinner, however, you know that education is a one-time investment and it never goes wrong if invested correctly, what you are going through is challenging indeed, however, would you want Yankho to go through same in the coming years?
20/11/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe you also want him to grow because as per the current economy in Malawi, the challenges you're experiencing now could be a part of Yankho's life in the next 10 years if he stays there. On the other hand, if he secures admission, performs consistently in the EWYL program, and completes his education in India, his future could be considerably brighter.
20/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: India is renowned for its education, and upon returning to Malawi, he could easily find a job earning $1000 to $1500 per month. However, if he decides to work in India, his potential for growth is even greater. In India, a fresher's basic salary is typically $5000 to $6000 per year, and this presents a significant opportunity for his career to flourish. With such an opportunity, your child would not only be in a better position than you are but also in a position to support you effectively.
20/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I urge you to consider the long-term perspective and not just the immediate challenges. While the next 5-6 months might be challenging, it's a small Investement for your child's future growth and the opportunity to provide a better life for both himself and your family.
20/11/23, 8:35 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: No problem because you were attending a meeting equally important.
20/11/23, 8:36 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Ok. Thanks
20/11/23, 8:37 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: This is so encouraging to us
20/11/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for understanding. I am happy to see that you are encouraged by Yankho's higher education.
20/11/23, 8:53 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Exactly. Thanks
20/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/11/23, 8:58 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: My question is: apart from Galgotias University is there any University in India offering the same courses as Galgotias?
20/11/23, 9:00 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Another question - Can we allowed to pay admission fee and other expenses more than twice?
20/11/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Thank you for your query, since our available hours, for now, are over so I would love to address your query tomorrow at 12:30 pm and I will help you understand the process better, I hope you will be available.
21/11/23, 5:05 am - +265 888 77 70 30: I will be available
21/11/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Yankho,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if we can connect now and continue with our discussion?
21/11/23, 12:36 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Good day to you as well. Iam available now
21/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me my schedules have been really packed these days, however, let me address your concerns now. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
21/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
21/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
21/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
21/11/23, 6:44 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Thanks for the explanation. Iam clear
21/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias , you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that? <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 6:52 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Ok understood but about transfer option Iam not aware
21/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
21/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
21/11/23, 7:15 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: What a good explanation. Thanks for taking your time to explain this to us. I have understood
21/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have understood well. Coming to your second query,  could you please help me understand better which cost are you referring to twice?
21/11/23, 8:09 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Welcome. On second question I meant more than 2 instalments when paying registration fee because it can be difficult for someone who is earning Less than 300 dollars to pay 600 dollars at once. Why do the university not allow for example ample time of 2 months to pay for the registration fee as we understand the admission into the university will take place after 8 months in September?
21/11/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand the perspective from where you have been coming from if I had been at your place I would have had the same perspective. However, after working with the Universities for the past couple of years and counseling 1000+ students I understand the reason that these timelines are in place. As you are aware this scholarship opportunity is a worldwide opportunity and not only for your child's rights, and a scholarship comes with a limited number of seats so even if the academic year commences in August- September, the seats would not be available and this is the reasons students are proactive in the admissions at the university. The idle timeline is 15 days as per the university if someone wants to secure their seat with the university however since you are enrolled through Edoofa and we are aware of the challenges that parents face since these are not new challenges, parents go through them frequently this is the reason why we have meetings with the universities and came up with the Endowment Program which was discussed with you.
21/11/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This approval of the endowment program was possible because of the hard work and the number of arrivals that was possible last year and based on that the university has not only given us the time to pay the registration fees within 45 days but they have also given us an opportunity where we are able to pay $150 out of the $750 registration on your behalf. Now when you see this you already have a 45-day time given by the university with a scholarship if you had to a regular admission you could do that in March or April but at that time you would not be getting the benefits of the endowment so you have to consider that this is an opportunity for you that is benefiting you only if you keep looking at it as a burden then you will not be able to see the bigger picture.
21/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While all of this is true I understand that even after 45 days the financial challenges cannot be resolved considering the economy there. The challenge that you are facing is very common many parents go through the same and I believe this is exactly why you wanted your child to study abroad in the first place so that he does not go through the same challenges that you are going through in the coming 10 years, right?
21/11/23, 8:53 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: For sure I don't want my son to go through the challenges we are facing today
21/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In such cases, we do help the parents by seeking extension after discussion with the academic Board, however, before that, I would like to understand how much have you been able to raise by now and how much will you be able to raise before 28th of November, this will help me understand and have a better discussion?
21/11/23, 9:03 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Iam capable of savind 50 dollars a month and by 28th November I will be able to raise 200 dollars. This is so because I had also a challenge of school fees in Yankho's secondary education that forced me to take loan which Iam still paying back up to now
21/11/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, if I understand that right, you are saying that you will be able to raise $200 and deposit the $200 on November 28th without fail?
21/11/23, 9:13 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Exactly. Thanks
21/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. Alright, please, thank you for sharing the confirmation with me here. Now, on that note, please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti about the cause of the delay in your registration fee and state the reason why and even mention the date and amount that you will be able to pay $200 on 28th of November 2023.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail, once done share the screenshot with me.
21/11/23, 9:19 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Thank you for the guidance. Will do so
21/11/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response.
21/11/23, 9:22 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Should I write the letter today or tomorrow?
21/11/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can write the mail today and share the screenshot with me, so I will be able to have a discussion with the academic board tomorrow.
21/11/23, 9:26 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Alright
21/11/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can share the screenshot once done, since it is past our available hours now, I would be closing our conversation for today, have a great night ahead.
21/11/23, 9:34 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Remind me of admission group name. Is it that reference number on offer letter?
21/11/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The admissions group name is *Yankho 2K22JUL1292*
21/11/23, 9:36 pm - +265 888 77 70 30: Thanks
21/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

Regarding the promise I made let me say that I went to one of my bank account at National bank of Malawi and I tried to make transactions withe the bank though they were doubting if the transaction will be successful due to shortage of dollars in our country and also because they saw I was asking for 200 USD yet on the invoice  the registration is 600 USD.
