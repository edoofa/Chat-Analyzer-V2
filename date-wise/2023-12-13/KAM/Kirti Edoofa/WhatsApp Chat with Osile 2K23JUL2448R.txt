I hope this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, Admission Officer* at Edoofa. Along with Mr. Milan (Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Senior Admission Officer), Mr. Jyotishman (Head of Admission), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction so that you can reap the most benefits from the Edoofa scholarship program.

03/08/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
03/08/23, 7:50 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes we can
03/08/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 7:52 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Iam done
03/08/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
03/08/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
03/08/23, 8:02 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes i can understand
03/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
03/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/08/23, 11:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Osile.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, however, you did not respond. So I wanted to reach out and check if you are available to connect with us today?
04/08/23, 12:52 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Helo sir how are you .iam doing good
04/08/23, 12:53 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Sorry for not responding  yesterday
04/08/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great and I am glad to know that you are doing well. That is alright, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
04/08/23, 12:54 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes we can
04/08/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
04/08/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
04/08/23, 12:56 pm - +27 61 282 2560: This message was deleted
04/08/23, 12:57 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Everything  is clear sir
04/08/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
04/08/23, 12:59 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes we can proceed
04/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
04/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
04/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
04/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
04/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
04/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
04/08/23, 1:01 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Let me go through  it tonight
04/08/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by today 09.00 PM?

04/08/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 144 3224: Noted sir
04/08/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us as discussed earlier?
04/08/23, 9:06 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Hi everyone  iam still busy watching i didnt manage to watch it because  of loadshedding
04/08/23, 9:21 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Helo iam done
04/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
04/08/23, 9:35 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Video 1 : i understand  that students must be teachable and open minded
Video 2: Edoofa is also the there to increase students capacity for success to make students more responsible and independent 
Video3:  founders they are encouraging  students to pay attention  so that they can qualify at the good institute
04/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding I shall wait for your response for video 4.
04/08/23, 9:43 pm - +27 61 282 2560: 5: SOP this an important  document students must be carefull when they arw fillin this form
04/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
04/08/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
04/08/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
05/08/23, 10:07 am - +27 61 282 2560: My net work is poor due to loadshedding sorry
05/08/23, 10:07 am - +27 61 282 2560: My Wifi is not working
05/08/23, 10:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, I shall share the tasks with you and you can go through the messages once you are connected to a better network.
05/08/23, 10:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Monday at 09.00 pm.

07/08/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 150 5494: I will start with the question 2 :The difference is that the content in newspapers is current news and developments on ongoing issues in the world with short articles However Magazines on the other hand have specific content such as fashion medicine and sports, with long articles
07/08/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Question 3:The difference between journalism and Studio television is that Journalism is the practice of reporting, writing and editing news for mass communication. It involves investigating, verifying and presenting information. However to the other side Studio Television  which is also called a television production studio it provides videos either for the production of live Television and it, s recording onto video tape or other media
07/08/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Question 4 : what I understand about Journalism Ethics is that it shows how the Journalists decide what news to write each day? How do they convey the science of a politicized issue like climate change?, How do they decide when to print national secrets? The answers of those questions are informed by the Journalistic Ethics which guides reporters and editors to seek out the truth and act with integrity
07/08/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Question 5: Characteristics of  Journalism are 1: Precision
2 :Objectivity and factual
3:inverted pyramid
4:Fairness and balance
5:Bravity and Simplicity
08/08/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing question 1, it is duly noted with us, May I know a time by when will you be able to share the SOP form?
08/08/23, 4:24 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Eish send it but i forget to take screen shoot .what can i do there
08/08/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, your response is recorded. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
08/08/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
08/08/23, 4:25 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Thank yu
08/08/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
08/08/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Yes
08/08/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
08/08/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Yes I, m ready
08/08/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
08/08/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
08/08/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/08/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Yes
08/08/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
08/08/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
08/08/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
08/08/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 150 5494: I will the other form later
08/08/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 150 5494: I will send the other form with my results soon
08/08/23, 4:48 pm - +27 61 282 2560: An excuse there is another slip  result she didnt send there she have to send it
08/08/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, she can send that when she will share her SOP response, may I know if we are connected with each other now?
08/08/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 144 3224: Noted how are you today sir

16/08/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, on Thursday it was mentioned that you had a conversation over call with the headmaster regarding the result slip, so I was wanting to know a update from your side regarding the same.
16/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
16/08/23, 9:45 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Helo
16/08/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well @27612822560
16/08/23, 9:47 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Iam good sir
16/08/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
16/08/23, 9:53 pm - +27 61 282 2560: I did get in touch with them maybe their network is down
16/08/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, we can continue with our discussion if you are available, and once you are able to collect the result slip you can share it in the group, does this plan sounds acceptable to you?
16/08/23, 10:07 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes sir
16/08/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you were clear here?
16/08/23, 10:16 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes iam clear sir
16/08/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
16/08/23, 10:17 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes sir
16/08/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
16/08/23, 10:22 pm - +27 61 282 2560: That $750 we have to pay it after she recieve  a letter  from the university  or
16/08/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are correct you will be required to pay the $750 after you get receive your offer letter from the university. 

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
16/08/23, 10:31 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes
16/08/23, 10:31 pm - +27 61 282 2560: We can move on
16/08/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
16/08/23, 10:33 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Noted sir
16/08/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
16/08/23, 10:38 pm - +27 61 282 2560: No i dont have sir
16/08/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
16/08/23, 10:43 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Ok sir good night  thank yu
16/08/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great night to you too.

16/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Yes I am
16/10/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
16/10/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
16/10/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
16/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Noted thank you
16/10/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
16/10/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
16/10/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
16/10/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
16/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 150 5494: I am done
16/10/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
16/10/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Osile, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Osile,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you yesterday, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
17/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Yes I was preparing for my exam .I am sorry
17/10/23, 12:36 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Good day everybody  i read and understand  everything you said there
17/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that everything is clear to you. Now moving ahead with the next point.

*2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 1:18 pm - +27 61 282 2560: I can understand but i just want to ask is it mean that as timr goes on the fees is going to be increase or it will remaim cpnsistent until she finished her school
17/10/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27612822560 Thank you for your query, let me help you understand here what I am trying to make you understand every year each university revises its fee structure, and since Osile's admission is for August 2024, the fee structure will be revised by that time, however, since you are enrolled under Edoofa, this gives you a benefit year. 

With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain its fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This opportunity enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India. I hope we are clear now?
17/10/23, 2:00 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Ok i understand now
17/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
18/10/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Osile.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, however, you did not respond, since we were not able to connect yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/10/23, 1:28 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Hi how are you
18/10/23, 1:29 pm - +27 61 282 2560: So do yu mean we have to pay $600 first
18/10/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Yes, please as you may recall the registration fee is $750, however, here you will only be required to pay $600 and Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, and this $600 can be paid in two installments as well, of $300 each. 

This fee is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.
I hope we are clear here?
18/10/23, 1:38 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes iam clear now thank you
18/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 2:00 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Thank you for the information  let me pass this message to my parents in Zimbabwe
18/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely you can do that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 2:02 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Can you pleasw provide with more information
18/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure. let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
18/10/23, 2:07 pm - +27 61 282 2560: I can understand now so it means if the student managed to get 6 points and above will be able to receive  50% scholarship
18/10/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No @27612822560 for a student to receive a 50% scholarship a minimum of 2 E passes are required however, if they get more than that and if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

I hope we are clear now?
18/10/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Osile.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress @263771443224 @263781505494 @27612822560?
19/10/23, 1:22 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Hi how are yu
19/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
19/10/23, 1:53 pm - +27 61 282 2560: For now iam busy at work
19/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you must be occupied, in that case, may I know if you will be available to connect with us today at 07:30 pm?
19/10/23, 3:16 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes we can by 7:30  i will free
20/10/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Osile,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied with work commitments however, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you however it seems like you are not available to respond, may I know if we are still connected?
20/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Yes we are still connected
20/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Let us move ahead with the next point. 

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
20/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
20/10/23, 11:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
21/10/23, 8:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Osile,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 8:24 am - +27 61 282 2560: Morning  how are yu today

21/10/23, 9:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/10/23, 10:02 am - +27 61 282 2560: But just wanted to ask about diploma and degree  .yu have to  choose or edoofa have to choose for yu
21/10/23, 10:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: We shall give you the choice according to your subject combinations and what is closed to your preference.
21/10/23, 10:56 am - +27 61 282 2560: Oohk
21/10/23, 10:57 am - +27 61 282 2560: I understand  we can continue
21/10/23, 10:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/10/23, 11:00 am - +27 61 282 2560: No i dont have any queries
21/10/23, 11:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: As Osile's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Osile is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/10/23, 11:10 am - +27 61 282 2560: Yes iam very excited
21/10/23, 11:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
21/10/23, 11:11 am - Kirti Edoofa: Also could you please share a clearer picture of the statement of entry as I inquired last time as well?
21/10/23, 11:15 am - +27 61 282 2560: My apologies  on that i tried to call my parents home to resend it but network  connection problem

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 11:58 am - +27 61 282 2560: I managed to through  it
15/11/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/11/23, 12:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Osile,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 2:52 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Sorry for late respond
16/11/23, 2:53 pm - +27 61 282 2560: We are still connected can we procced
16/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we can connect. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 3:10 pm - +27 61 282 2560: (1)  $1800 USD 
(2)  4 year ( 8 semesters )
(3)  $300 USD
(4)  $750 USD
16/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please let me know the per-semester fee after scholarship?
16/11/23, 3:20 pm - +27 61 282 2560: $900  USD
16/11/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes i understand  thank yu
16/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 4:26 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Understood
16/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Osile

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday however, you did not respond although I noticed that you were able to go through my message. May I know if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 8:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
18/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Hello
18/11/23, 4:21 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Hi how are you
20/11/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Osile.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I wanted to inform you that we will be connecting today at 06:00 pm CAT, to discuss the offer letter in more detail and address any queries that you might have. I hope you will be available, have a great day till then!
20/11/23, 3:07 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Ok noted
20/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 150 5494: Hello
20/11/23, 6:19 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Hi everyone
20/11/23, 6:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/11/23, 6:45 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes we can
20/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you are clear so far?
20/11/23, 7:03 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Can  yu explain please
20/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, the $200 is the examination fee which every university charges before the start of their semester final exams, per semester the fee charge is $100 hence it makes your examination fee annually as $200.
20/11/23, 7:12 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Ok i understand
20/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
20/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
20/11/23, 7:24 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes we are together i have to talk to my parents inZimbabwe
20/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can definitely do that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 7:43 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes yu can explain
20/11/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/11/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/11/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response, however you did not response, since our available hours for today are over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
21/11/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since our available hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm, I hope you will be available considering there is a deadline as well with the offer letter, I hope you will prioritize this discussion. I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
22/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Osile.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
03/12/23, 7:11 am - +27 61 282 2560: Hi everyone i just wanted to say we didnt manage to pay $750 on the 28 of NOVEMBER  is the any option we can take .or we can proceed  next 2024 .i think we are going to arrange about the finance with my family .may you  please  give Oslie another chance
04/12/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon parents and Osile. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was unable to connect with you when you reached out as it was past our available hours. However, I am now active and ready for our session. Hence, may I know if you are available now to proceed with the session so that we can discuss the concern you shared above in detail? <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 12:53 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Hi.
04/12/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was able to go through the message above and I understand that raising the amount all at once can be a challenge, however, what I would like to understand first is the reason for your being inactive despite our best efforts to connect with you even over the personal window, may I know what happened all of a sudden?
05/12/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Osile,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I eagerly anticipate your response to my previous message, but I fully comprehend that you might have been preoccupied and unable to reply. At your earliest convenience, may I kindly request a confirmation regarding continuing our communication? I look forward to hearing from you soon.
05/12/23, 12:56 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Helo how are you everybody
05/12/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/12/23, 1:58 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Yes we can
05/12/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now with regard to our conversation over the personal window yesterday I understand that after all the medicine bills for your father and younger daughter raising $750 is not easy, and for that I would like to understand what is your monthly expense on medication please?
05/12/23, 2:53 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Iam using $200 .before he was sponsered by the government hosptal but now because  of no medication  in the  hospitals wr have to buy for our8
05/12/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, and may I know how much are you able to save every month?
05/12/23, 3:00 pm - +27 61 282 2560: I will manage to to save $100 a month
05/12/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, let me help you understand why continuing Osile's process for next year's intake is not a good idea. Because you will be losing on the Endowment benefits, meaning you will not be granted the $150 grant and the other 6 benefits we discussed above. That is the reason we were not suggesting the same to you. We understand how the endowment benefits come into play and help you out. With that said, let me also address the second alternative that you have suggested.
05/12/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While taking a gap year may seem like it would provide you with enough time to prepare your finances, I am certain you might be able to do that, however, that might not be a viable solution for you, and that is the reason we did not suggest this to you in the first place.
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The reason being, that the universities revise the tuition fee every year, and by the time you start with Osile's admission in 2025, that would further add to the financial pressure since the fee would be increased by at least 40%. As of now, the scholarship offer that Osile has received is in accordance with 2023's fee structure, and as we move forward with the rounds of application, the fee for 2024 will be revised, adding to the financial burden for you and your family.

Secondly, when you factor in the economy of South africa, I am sure you are aware that over the past few years, the economy has been in decline. By the next year, while you might be able to save up on expenses, these costs might factor in and once again add to your financial burden.
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, while we understand that you are the ones who are to make decisions for your child's higher education, we, as educators, have guided thousands of students every year to help them plan their admission process and higher education despite the financial challenges they face. Just like those students, ma'am, if you want us to help you out here, which is something we wish to do, I believe you have to take a step forward, understand the recommendations we have in place, and the basis of the same. If you are willing to work towards the solution, then we can certainly help you out.
05/12/23, 3:55 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Can you please help me iam stressed dont know what to do .my wish is for my daughter  to do her higher education
05/12/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please do not worry I understand where you are coming from and if I had been at your place I might also have been stressed. Being your admission officer I am committed to assisting you in every situation since Osile's education is equally important to me as well. You know we will be having a meeting with the university officials of Galgotias on Thursday and we will discuss the students' seriousness for their higher education and this month's performance as well. I can use this opportunity and help you here by discussing your case with them as well, I have a payment plan that I can discuss with them as well and it will be flexible for you as well:
05/12/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: $100 by the 20th of December 2023.
$100 by the 20th of January 2024
$100 by the 20th of February 2024
$100 by the 20th of March 2024. 

May I know if this will help you to ease your burden?
05/12/23, 4:40 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Is it possible is i start by January  because this month i have to go yo Zimbabwe to see the situation on ground i dont think i will manage but jaunary obviously i will manage
05/12/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, it was my dinner break also I was able to have a discussion with the team about the request you shared above, however, 20th January will be a long time and the universities have to be fair to every student as well, but I can still utilize the meeting on Thursday and discuss if they can agree by 1st of January, may I know if that will work for you?
05/12/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you however, it seems like you are not available to connect with us. In that case, I would suggest you go through the message above and share your thoughts regarding the same, I will be connecting with you on the 7th of December since I am not available tomorrow due to some personal work commitments, have a great evening ahead.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
[11:05 pm, 11/12/2023] +27 61 282 2560: Hi hope yu are ok may you please kindly resend your message .thank you
11/12/23, 7:55 pm - +27 61 282 2560: I think  i responded  there concerning about paying $100 from December .i said is it possible  for me to start january paying that  $100
11/12/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I certainly understand that, however, January will be a long time, since the universities have to be fair with all the students. I can have a conversation with the university and help you process your admission as a regular application by 20th January, but that would mean letting go of the Endowment Grant of $150, and you will need to deposit $750. If you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out. However, sir, that cannot be done if you do not understand the importance of these due dates.
11/12/23, 8:16 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Are yu saying by 20 january  i have to  deposit $750 in total
11/12/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27612822560 no I am not saying that I am letting you know that, if you wish to have an extension it is certainly possible however, the university needs to be fair to other students as well, and for the month more extension you can end up losing the Endownment benefits. And that is why I suggested you a flexible payment plan above.
11/12/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can respond to the message above by tomorrow, since it is past our available hours in that case, we will not be able to continue with our discussion which will lead to a broken discussion so let us reconnect tomorrow and start with our discussion. I hope you will be available. Have a great night ahead.
12/12/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Osile,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday.

Therefore, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can start our discussion?
12/12/23, 3:04 pm - +27 61 282 2560: Hi
12/12/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I'm pleased to hear that we can now connect. Please accept my apologies for not being able to get in touch sooner, as I was engaged in a work meeting that demanded my attention. May I know if you are available to connect with me now?
12/12/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
