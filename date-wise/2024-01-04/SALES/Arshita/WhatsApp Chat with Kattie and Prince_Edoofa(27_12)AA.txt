27/12/23, 9:45 am - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
27/12/23, 9:45 am - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/12/23, 9:45 am - Arshita: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, a number of schools, educators and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.
27/12/23, 9:45 am - Arshita: *I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity, aren't you?*

27/12/23, 10:48 am - +265 991 74 37 28: You are welcome
27/12/23, 10:48 am - Arshita: Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now,we accept upto 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregrate of 35,this would be the maxumum limit for eligibility.All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program

The minimum requirement was higher pre pandemic but during the pandemic a lot of students failed to recieve enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements has been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and perform well in MSCE!
27/12/23, 10:53 am - +265 991 74 37 28: With their performance am very confident and I know they won't fail me..and am very happy that you have increased the chances of higher quantum of scholarship this can help the students to work with effort
27/12/23, 11:00 am - +265 991 74 37 28: So what are the requirements for their programs that I can get as a parent to be well prepared of and what are the challenges as parent we get the most in readiness of our students to go further,and what is the role of the government in the process to get our kids get inspired to get through the learning process better? I hope you understand what I mean...
27/12/23, 11:02 am - Arshita: These are the point requirement
27/12/23, 11:02 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in your children studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
27/12/23, 11:04 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Not any and I have never gone through such a process before,in short I don't even know what's the process.
27/12/23, 11:04 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Sorry to say
27/12/23, 11:06 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
27/12/23, 11:06 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:06 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done

27/12/23, 11:54 am - Arshita: For *KATTIE*
27/12/23, 11:54 am - Arshita: As you mentioned that it is your desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course as students need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with high grades to be eligible for Medicine and the process is regulated by the National Testing Agency under Ministry of Education. At the same time, I do acknowledge your strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference in the health sector, due to which you are eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as   

*1) Bachelor of Physiotherapy*
*2) Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*
*3) Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*
*4) Bachelor of Pharmacy*
*5) Bachelor of Optometry*
*6) Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology* etc

Do you want me to explain any of these courses to you?
27/12/23, 11:55 am - Arshita: For *PRINCE*

Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: Since he is not having Physics , he is not eligible for the same. 

At the same time may I know if he has any alternate career aspirations?
27/12/23, 11:59 am - +265 991 74 37 28: May you please explain the no 2, Bachelor of science in medical Lab Technology

27/12/23, 1:56 pm - +265 991 74 37 28: Am here sorry for the delay
27/12/23, 1:56 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
27/12/23, 2:02 pm - +265 991 74 37 28: I know by learning through these institutions the students have much to learn and bring home the best of them through culture and education system,these students might be strong pillars of our tomorrow and good leaders through what you implement in India
27/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
27/12/23, 2:05 pm - +265 991 74 37 28: No
27/12/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to you?
27/12/23, 2:09 pm - +265 991 74 37 28: With these reduced costs I feel it's affordable to me
27/12/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
27/12/23, 2:10 pm - +265 991 74 37 28: No go ahead sir,it sounds more interesting
27/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
27/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
27/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
27/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
27/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
27/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

27/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think your children will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
27/12/23, 2:19 pm - +265 991 74 37 28: They can benefit alot cos they learn how to work and become strong and know to earn money and education all in one,and I believe in doing that as I have already said,will have a better tomorrow
27/12/23, 2:20 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
27/12/23, 2:20 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:26 pm - +265 991 74 37 28: Yes I do but as already said am just new in this whole process it won't be enough to understand everything at once but with the interest I have to these kids to go further on education I know will understand everything as we go..
27/12/23, 2:28 pm - +265 991 74 37 28: And please if there is more to share do so to inspire these newly introduced students for they will understand the benefits in all the aspects you've shared with us
27/12/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
27/12/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
27/12/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
27/12/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
27/12/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
27/12/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,

03/01/24, 10:04 am - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
03/01/24, 10:11 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Very impressive so according to our understanding is there anything you can recommend us to atleast follow as we are about to have a genuinely satisfying quality of education..
03/01/24, 10:13 am - Arshita: Our team will be guiding you about everything at each step
03/01/24, 10:13 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Ok
03/01/24, 10:14 am - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
03/01/24, 10:21 am - +265 991 74 37 28: I feel like a dream come true and the only challenge we have is that,as you know that Malawi has been far behind with education this can be the very best of what our tomorrow leaders can be, mainly where I come from it's a very remote area,and above all this will encourage many of our dropouts students to follow the same after these students have the opportunity of this edoofa scholarships
03/01/24, 10:22 am - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as he/she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
03/01/24, 10:23 am - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
03/01/24, 10:23 am - +265 991 74 37 28: And please these beneficiaries may help alot as they can easily guide us all through all our challenges..
03/01/24, 10:23 am - Arshita: absolutely, I will be sharing them with you towards the end of our session
03/01/24, 10:35 am - +265 991 74 37 28: As for me I don't know some of the requirements as I have already said that here we are new to this kind of education and had no any guidance before that we can atleast follow..we only have the guidance of our local universities.
03/01/24, 10:37 am - Arshita: That is noted
03/01/24, 10:37 am - Arshita: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
03/01/24, 10:38 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 10:38 am - Arshita: To sum up, shall I inform you why and when the enrollment fee is paid?
03/01/24, 10:40 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Yes please
03/01/24, 10:42 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
03/01/24, 10:42 am - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/01/24, 10:45 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Ok
03/01/24, 10:46 am - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
03/01/24, 10:50 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Very impressive
03/01/24, 10:53 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 10:56 am - +265 991 74 37 28: But what happens in the process that we got a challenge like loosing guardians who pays the fees for  students or loosing the student or the conviniences? But you have run all the 3 phases?
03/01/24, 11:01 am - +265 991 74 37 28: I feel like we have discussed up to stage  02
03/01/24, 11:07 am - Arshita: Then the scholarship seat will be given to the next eligible candidate.
03/01/24, 11:07 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Ok
03/01/24, 11:07 am - Arshita: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
03/01/24, 11:10 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Yes go ahead
03/01/24, 11:11 am - Arshita: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
03/01/24, 11:11 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
03/01/24, 11:11 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
03/01/24, 11:16 am - +265 991 74 37 28: This step 5 process starts right away or it takes time
03/01/24, 11:18 am - Arshita: Once the student gets enrolled in the Edoofa scholarship program they will be added to their admissions group and will also be assisted by their EWYL mentors who will guide them further.

They can begin their EWYL journey even while still be at their home.
03/01/24, 11:19 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Ok
03/01/24, 11:19 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
03/01/24, 11:19 am - +265 991 74 37 28: Clear
03/01/24, 11:28 am - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
03/01/24, 11:29 am - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.
