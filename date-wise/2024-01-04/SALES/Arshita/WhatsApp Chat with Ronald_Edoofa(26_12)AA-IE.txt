What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
I learnt that Edoofa is a good institution in terms of education and it requires hard workers.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?

It is because Iam a hard worker and iam committed to my work .I think i should also be recruited because it is my desire to learn from high quality educational institutions like this one .Last but not least ,I want to influence younger students to work hard in their school work.

26/12/23, 10:11 am - Arshita: As per the protocols of the program, the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary for the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So I am making you the admin of the group so please add them and let me know once they are added.*

In case they are not available right now, they can still be part of a group and catch up with the conversations later. Let me know the names with which I should address them.
