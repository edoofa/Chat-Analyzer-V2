*I am Garima career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us, Mr. Sahil, Senior Career Counselor, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa who will be evaluating your application.*

We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program as referred by *Providence* from Zimbabwe.

Due to the overwhelming response from applicants, we wanted to ensure you receive personalised attention. Therefore, we've scheduled a dedicated time slot just for you:

📅 Date: 03 JANUARY 2024
🕤 Time: 10:00 PM CAT

Please mark this date and time on your calendar to ensure you're available for this important counseling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation. To prepare for our session, we encourage you to explore our website at [www.edoofa.com], the video and document shared along. This will provide you with valuable insights into our programs and opportunities. In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
