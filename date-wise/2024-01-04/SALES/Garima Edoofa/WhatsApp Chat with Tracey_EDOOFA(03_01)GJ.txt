03/01/24, 9:53 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263787180349 @27799119580 , Hope you are doing well.
03/01/24, 9:54 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to begin with your counseling session, shall we start?
03/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 718 0349: Yes
03/01/24, 11:28 am - Garima Edoofa: So Tracey, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Tariro!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what did you happen to learn from your friend?
03/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 718 0349: it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through the scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 5:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
