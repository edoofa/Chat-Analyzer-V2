So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what did you happen to learn from your friend?
03/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 623 2933: she didn't tell me much she said  you came to their school looking for scholars 
she said that you can recruit more people to the scholarship  program
03/01/24, 4:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, Let me help you in understanding the program in a better way.
03/01/24, 4:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: You see, Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
03/01/24, 4:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

03/01/24, 4:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the above information, and be transparent and active throughout the counseling session and Evaluation, as your counselor, I'll guide you for the Eligibility Check Interview, discussing your course, country, finances, and more. You'll then complete a scholarship test and interview with the Program Director. Ready to compete?
03/01/24, 4:21 pm - +263 71 623 2933: I really  understand
03/01/24, 5:02 pm - +263 71 623 2933: Now I have come to the full understanding of the Edoofa scholarship program.
Edoofa is there to provide quality education to students from all parts of the word.
It is there to help with financial services and some things that may hinder good education for students.
It has also benefits which are lower fees , it offers training programs etc
I can say that is briefly  how I understand  Edoofa  program
03/01/24, 5:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
