27/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Thank you very much. 
Kelvin is a very ambitious young man who does things with passion. Currently, I am doing my Lower 6 at Hamilton High School, paying $100  per term.
I want to pursue law as it's been my life long wish to someday own a law firm and later step up and be a magistrate. Over the years I have managed to defile everything that makes me feel weak hence I sternly say I do not have any weakness. I used to be emotionally weak however after I had exposed myself to a lot of psychology books, my emotional intelligence increased. I am a good problem solver and l like studying people's day to day lives.
I am also good at debating and public speaking, that is why I am part of the Bulawayo Junior Council. My leadership skills are exceptional no wonder I am the senior prefect at school and also the Sergeant of Arms of the toastmasters club at school.
I spend my free time ( not literally free time) reading my psychology books and making myself familiar with the worldly affairs through reading the news.
I am from a family of six, well five now since my mother is no more. My father is a self employed man who makes and sells building material. I have three siblings a bigger brother, and two sisters. 
...
Thank you once more.
27/12/23, 12:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is a pleasure to know about you and your family, Kelvin.

28/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Firstly I would share the knowledge I would have gotten that side. With time, when I make it in life, l would establish a school that literally caters for arts students. My country does not very much consider Arts careers
28/12/23, 2:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Kelvin, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
28/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 001 9872: I do agree. The library has been the best so far
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Yes I actually wanted to ask about that.
28/12/23, 2:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: This message was deleted

28/12/23, 2:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you understood everything properly?
28/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Alright, this is well informing. I see you have highly rated varsities and renowned lecturers. I am going to work hard to ensure I study in one of the best Universities.
28/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Yes I understood everything
28/12/23, 2:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your hard work.
28/12/23, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: So are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
28/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Not sure about my family but I am not aware
28/12/23, 2:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
28/12/23, 2:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/12/23, 2:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Okay, I understand.
28/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 001 9872: So since I am going for Upper Six next year, when am l getting tested
28/12/23, 3:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Kelvin what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/12/23, 3:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts on the same? <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Ohh..l fancy the earn while you learn program
28/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 001 9872: I think it's fantastic
28/12/23, 3:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Indeed it is.
28/12/23, 3:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
28/12/23, 4:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
29/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 001 9872: Good morning
29/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 001 9872: I am ready for today's session
29/12/23, 9:20 am - Garima Edoofa: Good morning, hope you’re doing well.

As discussed yesterday, I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
29/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 001 9872: Yes, let's start
29/12/23, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright Kelvin, *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
29/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 001 9872: Yes please
29/12/23, 10:56 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/12/23, 10:56 am - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
29/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 001 9872: Okay l understand
29/12/23, 11:00 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/12/23, 11:00 am - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/12/23, 11:01 am - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje

29/12/23, 11:01 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
29/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 001 9872: Alright
29/12/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 001 9872: Yes I think this will be beneficial
29/12/23, 11:17 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/12/23, 11:17 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 001 9872: This is very interesting, and it is something different. I fancy the EWYL program
29/12/23, 11:33 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
29/12/23, 11:33 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
29/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 001 9872: I very much appreciate them all  with the second one getting most appreciation. I fancy the second one because most African companies require experience in the certain field that one would be looking for a job in
29/12/23, 11:45 am - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Kelvin, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
29/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 001 9872: Yes my parents will be doing so
29/12/23, 12:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Kelvin, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Alright, I'm ready
29/12/23, 12:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Kelvin as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Around $1500-$2250
29/12/23, 12:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/12/23, 12:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Ohhhhkay okay, so it's paid on the 31st of January
29/12/23, 12:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: We know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the word which is why we have decided for this slowdown period that a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.

Which simply means, if you are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receives Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, you will be receiving a time span of 7 days to pay the enrollment of payable amount of $350
29/12/23, 12:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
29/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Alright...well informing
29/12/23, 12:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/12/23, 12:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Kelvin basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
29/12/23, 12:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Noted
29/12/23, 12:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Kelvin, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
29/12/23, 1:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected kelvin?
29/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 341 0334: He will get back once the internet connect back
29/12/23, 2:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Duly noted.
29/12/23, 4:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for TUESDAY 2nd January at 10 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

29/12/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 341 0334: Thanks for such wishing you all the best in 2024. We had a power cuts  caused by persistent rains we are experiencing. God bless you all 🙏🏼
02/01/24, 10:29 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263773410334 @263780019872 , hope you all are doing well.
02/01/24, 10:29 am - Garima Edoofa: As discussed earlier I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
02/01/24, 5:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 10 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

03/01/24, 10:12 am - Garima Edoofa: @263780019872 I would like to inform you as EDOOFA receives more than 1277 plus applications a day and EDOOFA being a fair scholarship program gives equal opportunity to all the students in that case I would want you to complete your application in the next 48 hours or we would be forced to close it.
03/01/24, 6:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing back from you, but unfortunately, I didn't receive a response. Lately, our conversations have been a bit disrupted due to the timing not aligning with our available hours. I remain hopeful that we can have a smoother conversation tomorrow at 10:00 a.m, CAT. Your availability would be greatly appreciated; however, if you're unable to make it, please understand that, as an organization, we strive to be fair to all students. I may have to consider closing your application to ensure fairness in providing opportunities to other deserving students.
03/01/24, 8:11 pm - +263 78 001 9872: Good evening. I am very sorry for my poor participation in the group. It certainly will not happen next time. You had asked me to tell you what I have understood about the payment policy of the Edoofa. Well l have understood that the Edoofa program helps subsidise University payments for a student. You talked about application fee which normally costs about $300-$450, but can amount to alot of money since a student would have to apply to alot of Universities. But however, you said for a student to be part of the Edoofa program, she/he would have to pay $350 _(*once the student has been found eligible*)_ of which the other half would have been payed by the Edoofa program. This $350 would account for alot of things including foster care throughout the course. The student will do the EWYL program and will get an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee. You also mentioned that since economic instability is a major challenge to most African countries hence the parents of the students can pay $200 in 7days and pay the remaining within the next 30days. This is all I have understood.
