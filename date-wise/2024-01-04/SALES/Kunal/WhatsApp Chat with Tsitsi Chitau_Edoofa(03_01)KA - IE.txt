03/01/24, 11:03 am - Kunal: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Kelvin who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
03/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 71 690 7996: Yes he did
03/01/24, 11:30 am - Kunal: Can you tell me how much was the scholarship parameter he mentioned?
03/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 71 690 7996: The scholarship parameter is fully funded
03/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 71 690 7996: Thus 100 %
03/01/24, 12:10 pm - Kunal: *International Student Admission Eligibility Check:*

a) Nature of the Scholarship: Partial Scholarship or Fully Funded
Ans:

b) Cost of Education after the Edoofa scholarship: $1500-$3000 or $6000-$8000
Ans:

c) What, in your understanding, is the purpose of the EWYL Program? (Answer in 30-50 words)
Ans:

d) Why do you believe you should be accepted into the Edoofa Program? (Answer in 50-100 words)
Ans:

e) Are your parents aware of the details shared above? If yes, will your parents/guardians be part of the admissions process?
Ans:
03/01/24, 12:10 pm - Kunal: May I know if these questions were asked?
03/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 71 690 7996: Yes they were asked
03/01/24, 12:13 pm - Kunal: Please share your response for these questions
03/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 690 7996: a) fully funded 
b) $2000-$3000

c) PURPOSE OF Earn While You Learn 

The purpose of earn while you learn is that it reduces financial costs for your guardian , students might have ideas but because of scarcity ,earn while you learn will then provide all the financials and the students will get the chance to stand for their projects 
Earn while you learn gives students a room to advance their level of education ,it reduces chances of students borrowing money from the parent 
To my view I think thus the purpose of EARN WHILE YOU LEARN 


d) The reason why I should be accepted in the Edoofa program is that it gives me room to have more advanced knowledge than here 
I want to start up some projects that can benefit the majority of the edoofians and nationally 
In addition, I want to make my education more financially accessible ,the Edoofa program gives me room to expand my ideas so I can expose them to the world and make it a better environment to live .
I also get to link up with different people learning their home country language and many more .
I want to fullfill my purpose for life in India under the Edoofa program 

Above are some of the reasons I should be accepted in the Edoofa program 

e) Yes ,they can be part of the admissions process 
f) 9am - 12pm
03/01/24, 12:35 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing, Tsitsi

03/01/24, 5:42 pm - +263 71 690 7996: I was motivated by the technology there in India ,there is production and also  more advanced education than here 

2) I have understood the earn while learning  ,there is room for practical activities  ,I have understood that I can have a room to improve my knowledge and as well as that you people are genuine
