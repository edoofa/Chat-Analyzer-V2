03/01/24, 2:10 pm - Kunal: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

03/01/24, 2:18 pm - Kunal: Kundai, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me:
1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2) What are your understandings of the program as discussed with Leonor?
03/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 047 7770: Okay let me answer <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 78 047 7770: It is my pleasure that you gave me the opportunity to say it out the motivation on why l applies for the Edoofa scholarship program 

1)

So since as a child it has been my passion and dreams to study abroad whilst in the medical field. I have always been wanting to be a doctor but somehow due to career guidance that l managed to be involved in l realised that in the  medical field  there is no a doctor only,  rather there are many programs and jobs in  there , l appreciate my Uncle as one of my mentors who managed to encourage me and motivating me upto this level. The very moment my friend told me about your program l was happy amd by that time l told myself that finally my dream has come true and l believed in myself that l will secure a place there and she also told me on how you can assist one another with your organization 

From what l read in the document your sent me l felt like l really suit in with the qualifications you managed to list .l have heard about your access to quality education , the need for employability in higher education and your ability to provide educational opportunities to underprivileged and deserving students across the whole world. 

It was my pleasure when l heard that you offer these scholarships with the leading universities,  l really want to be studying in India as l heard of its quality education as well .

It is with my great honour to be part of the Edoofa scholarship program  together with the benefits your offer .I believe that working with you would help me in achieving my goals and passion with your organization.  As a child who have dreams to achieve more and being recognized as one of the top students  but without funds to make me that great somebody in the world is the main reason that motivated me to apply for the Edoofa Scholarships fund . 


I believe these are some of the motivations behind my application for the Edoofa scholarship program. <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 78 047 7770: My understanding are as follows;

When l discussed with Leonora she highlighted to me that you offer a variety of programs at your program to both the under privileged and the deserving students across the whole globe. She also told me that you get the opportunity to the career guidance on what you want to do which is one of the best thing l admire. And supporting together other extracurricular programs together with mentorship .Leonora also told me that you offer opportunities to various branches and your students resulting in greater marketing access . She highlighted your assistance on how you apply for the scholarships process until you land in India

It's evident that your passion for the medical field has been a driving force, and your journey reflects the valuable impact of mentorship from your uncle.

Your enthusiasm upon discovering the Edoofa scholarship program and its potential to make your dream of studying abroad a reality is genuinely uplifting. Your eagerness to secure a place and your belief in the alignment of your qualifications with the program's criteria are noteworthy.
