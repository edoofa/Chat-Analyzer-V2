03/01/24, 10:06 am - Kunal: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
03/01/24, 10:07 am - +265 986 93 76 47: Thank you  for making  me an admin

Please let me know once you are available!

03/01/24, 10:26 am - +265 986 93 76 47: Scholarship programs like the Edoofa Scholarship offer opportunities for students, particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds, to pursue quality and affordable higher education. So this motivated me for applying for scholarship programs:

1. *Financial Assistance*: Scholarships provide financial support to students who may not have the means to afford higher education on their own. By offering financial assistance, scholarship programs like Edoofa help students overcome financial barriers and pursue their academic goals.

2. *Access to Quality Education*: Many scholarship programs, including Edoofa, aim to provide students with access to quality education. These programs often collaborate with universities and educational institutions to offer scholarships that cover tuition fees, accommodation, and other related expenses.

3. *Empowerment and Opportunities*: Scholarships can empower students by providing them with opportunities they may not have otherwise had. By receiving a scholarship, students can gain the necessary skills and knowledge to pursue their desired careers and contribute to their communities.

4. *Support with Visa Processing*: Some scholarship programs, like Edoofa, also assist students with visa application processing. This support can be valuable for international students who may face challenges navigating the visa application process on their own.

This things mentioned  above, inspired me to  apply
03/01/24, 10:32 am - Kunal: I see you are well motivated and let me help you understand more
