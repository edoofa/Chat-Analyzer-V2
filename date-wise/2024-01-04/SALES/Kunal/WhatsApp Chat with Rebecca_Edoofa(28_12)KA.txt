28/12/23, 8:59 pm - +265 991 90 00 92: My name is Rebecca Charles, a form three student at Saint Louis Secondary School.   I am the first born in the family of two, that's I and my brother.  I am a Christian by religion.  I am a young Malawian lady, aged 15 years.  I am very strong in following areas; 
1. Decision making-  I understand myself that I am capable of making effective decisions
2. Prayerful-  I always seek the Lord's face in all the times, that's including both good and bad moments
3. Interactive- I really like and enjoy interacting with others and capable of working in a team
4. I am courageous
5. Ambitious 
6. Hard worker-  I understand myself as a hard worker mostly when it comes to academic.  I really have a great passion to go further with my academic and be able to reach my destination. 
 
- Just to mention some 

Below are some of my weaknesses;
1. Easily get bored when something bad come up.  If I am to be honest, I really cry a lot when something bad occur upon my life.
2. Looking down upon myself----- Sometimes when I look at myself, my family background, my academic, I feel like its very had for me to reach my destination.  

I am currently in form 3 at Saint Louis Secondary School.  I am taking the combination of the following subjects; Agriculture, Biology, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Chichewa, English. 

I would really wont to become a surgery doctor when I complete my studies.  I am much willing to take any course that will lead me to my destination.  

I am raised by a single parent and that is my mother.  My mom works at Achikondi Private Clinic as a Heathy Surveillance Assistant (HSA).   My mom's highest education level is Junior Certificate of Education (JCE) obtained from Masasa Community Day Secondary School. 

I have one sibling, that's my brother who is young than I.  He is schooling also. 

My mother has been supporting me with school fees and all other necessities for my education so far.  I don't have anyone who can support me financially so far apart from my mother.  I am trusting God that she will continue to support me though having a very big responsibility of supporting the family with all basic needs.  

- I am really looking forward to go further with my academic.  Thanks

28/12/23, 9:17 pm - +265 999 43 83 82: Well noted, thanks.
29/12/23, 9:47 am - Kunal: Greetings everyone

29/12/23, 10:22 am - +265 991 90 00 92: Yes lm available
29/12/23, 10:34 am - Kunal: So, may I know what fascinated you about pursuing a course and career in Medical field?
29/12/23, 10:53 am - +265 991 90 00 92: I understand that God called me to serve him through helping other people.  I have a great passion to help those with heathy challenges that needs surgery.
29/12/23, 11:02 am - Kunal: I see you are well motivated towards this career path and looking forward to excelling in it.

So, may I know your subjects of MSCE?
29/12/23, 11:10 am - +265 991 90 00 92: Agriculture, Biology, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Chichewa, English.
29/12/23, 11:21 am - Kunal: Well noted
Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now,we accept upto 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregrate of 35,this would be the maxumum limit for eligibility.All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program
29/12/23, 11:21 am - Kunal: The minimum requirement was higher pre pandemic but during the pandemic a lot of students failed to recieve enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements has been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and perform well in MSCE!
29/12/23, 11:35 am - +265 991 90 00 92: I am very confident that I can not fail to meet the requirements.  I hope I will be able to get better grades
29/12/23, 11:38 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
29/12/23, 11:38 am - Kunal: As you mentioned that it is your desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because you need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with great marks to be eligible for Nursing. At the same time, I do acknowledge your strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference, due to which you are eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as   

*1) Bachelor of Physiotherapy*
*2) Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*
*3) Bachelor of Pharmacy*
*4) Bachelor of Optometry*
*5) Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology etc*

Do you want me to explain any of these courses to you?
29/12/23, 12:08 pm - +265 991 90 00 92: Please help me understand the first course (Bachelor of Physiotherapy)
29/12/23, 12:09 pm - Kunal: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
29/12/23, 2:22 pm - +265 991 90 00 92: I understand and it sounds very good.  I guess this course is not contrary to my first option.  I can gladly take the course if I have an opportunity.
29/12/23, 2:24 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that!
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
29/12/23, 2:54 pm - +265 991 90 00 92: It is very important to have a picture of where you will be in some years to come.  I can surely see myself becoming a helper to  people who are in need of physiotherapy treatment.  I can see myself becoming a very strong woman of influence and be able to stand still and help those in need of physiotherapy.  I have all the confidence that God will help me to reach my destination through the help of Edoofa.  I am really ready to go further with my academic and be able to help people out there.  I have a strong courage as an Edoofian that I will be able to put into action what God has trusted me do.
29/12/23, 3:18 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
29/12/23, 4:12 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 5:13 pm - +265 999 43 83 82: That's wonderful
30/12/23, 7:26 am - +265 991 90 00 92: I have discovered that the school / education system in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local.  Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education.  There are many private schools in India and highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate and all other aspects of operations.

TERTIARY EDUCATION
After passing the Higher Secondary Examination, students may enroll in general degree programmes susch as bachelor's degree in arts, commerce or science, or professional degree programme such as engineering, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and law graduates.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
02/01/24, 4:47 pm - +265 991 90 00 92: No
02/01/24, 5:29 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 5:38 pm - +265 991 90 00 92: Thanks blessed to you two 👏👏
03/01/24, 9:59 am - Kunal: Good morning
Let us be grateful for this new day of our lives. 

So I am here to continue with your application 

How are you this morning?
03/01/24, 11:39 am - +265 991 90 00 92: I'm good what about you
03/01/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
03/01/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/01/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
