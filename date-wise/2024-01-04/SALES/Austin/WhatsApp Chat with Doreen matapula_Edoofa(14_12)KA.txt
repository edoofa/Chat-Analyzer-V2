As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
28/12/23, 3:01 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: That's an excellent question. For starters, I see myself pursuing my studies further by becoming a medical student after graduating from my bachelor's in Cardiovascular Technology. Finally, being an Edoofian will help me in getting into schools that I would like to pursue my career in more easily. I also feel that being an Edoofian member will make it easier for me to reach out of my dreams in becoming a medical doctor.
28/12/23, 3:02 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: My apologies for the delay
28/12/23, 3:22 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?

Indian schooling has achieved worldwide acknowledgment with its recognized decent variety of character. Diversed educational planning bodies administer the institute instruction scheme in India. I have also researched that India has a publicly funded higher education system that is the third largest in the world.

28/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
28/12/23, 4:17 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Allow me to first answer how I aim at achieving my career aspiration from studying in India. Firstly, studying in India is a privilege for me. However, I shall return to Malawi with a new perspective on culture, language skills, independence, and being a role model to many other children who have aspirations just like myself. 

And to answer how studying in India will implement a positive impact on my career...Having to study India will enable me to get a job much easier and faster than expected after graduating.
28/12/23, 4:25 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
28/12/23, 4:37 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: I am aware of the fact that having a scholarship as an international student allows the student to concentrate on their careers and studies rather than worrying about how they will pay back their loans. Scholarships make it easier to pursue education and career goals by breaking barriers. What I am not aware of are the costs of being an international student without any scholarship. Can you please break it down for me.
28/12/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 5:22 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Honestly speaking, I really can't say because I feel that my family can afford the reduced fees, but as the question suggests, "family," it is essential to discuss this with the family. So, prior to answering the question, we need to discuss it as a family
28/12/23, 5:33 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for a Board meeting. Let us connect at 6:40 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

28/12/23, 5:38 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Sure
28/12/23, 6:58 pm - Kunal: Good Evening
Shall we proceed?
28/12/23, 7:01 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Good evening. Let us proceed
28/12/23, 7:24 pm - Kunal: I can understand
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
28/12/23, 7:36 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: No, I do not... please elaborate
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
28/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
28/12/23, 7:48 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Yes, I think it would. However, each person has different strategies on which they do their studies, and presently, I have learned my strengths and weaknesses in what I do. What I know is I cannot manage two things simultaneously. My family and I have discussed the Edoofian scholarship and we have concluded that it is possible to afford for the payments.
28/12/23, 7:48 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
28/12/23, 7:51 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: I think that you have not understood me but I am not willing to work while doing my studies
28/12/23, 7:52 pm - Kunal: I can understand your concerns about facing the pressure of studying and working simultaneously. It's natural to want the best possible environment for your education. However, I'd like to emphasize that the "Earn While You Learn" program, like the one offered by Edoofa, is designed to strike a balance between work and study, ultimately benefiting the student in several ways:
28/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kunal: Financial Support: The program provides an opportunity for students to earn a portion of their tuition fees through part-time work, reducing the financial burden on their families. This can alleviate some of the financial pressures associated with education.

Practical Experience: Part-time work allows students to gain practical work experience while pursuing their studies. This can be a valuable addition to their resume and prepare them for future career opportunities.
28/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kunal: Time Management Skills: Balancing work and study teaches students valuable time management skills, helping them become more organized and efficient in managing their responsibilities.

Independence and Responsibility: The experience of earning while learning can foster independence and a sense of responsibility in students, as they learn to manage their finances and make informed decisions.
28/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kunal: It's important to note that the work component in programs like this is typically structured to be manageable, so it doesn't overwhelm students or interfere with their studies. Additionally, Edoofa is committed to providing the necessary support and guidance to ensure that students can successfully balance work and academics.
28/12/23, 7:55 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: I understand the emphasis but I am not interested in the "Earn While You Learn" program
28/12/23, 7:56 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 7:59 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Wow that is indeed inspiring but we are also two different people what might work for him would not work for me but I'd rather stick to what's best for me
28/12/23, 8:04 pm - Kunal: That is absolutely understandable and the EWYL program is optional Doreen and not mandatory. But do you wish to be engaged in practical learnings and skill development programs within your course?
28/12/23, 8:05 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: What are they about?
28/12/23, 8:14 pm - Kunal: The purpose of the EWYL program isn't just about the earning scholarship credits but focuses on the holistic development of each Edoofians through webinars, skills development programs, seminars, campus visits of our mentord, one on one training and assistance etc
28/12/23, 8:14 pm - Kunal: Thereby within the span on your course, our team ensures that you possess employability skills
28/12/23, 8:38 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: That sounds pleasant...
28/12/23, 8:39 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: How does one officially become an Edoofian? From the sessions?
28/12/23, 9:18 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *9:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*Make sure to be available tomorrow on priority to finish the session*

Stay Blessed!
29/12/23, 9:49 am - Kunal: Greetings everyone
How are you doing today?
29/12/23, 9:52 am - +265 991 00 20 67: Good Morning. I believe everyone is doing very well here. How about you there?
29/12/23, 10:12 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
29/12/23, 10:13 am - Kunal: Let me tell you that the student needs to clear the eligibility criteria in order to be found eligible for the program

The eligibility procedures are the criteria or set of evaluations that you need to get through inorder to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. They include-

-Final interview with Program Director(via whatsapp voice notes from a different interview group)
-Video interaction with your parents/parent

Your Academics, understanding of the program, willingness to be a part of the Edoofa family, personal traits, qualities, previous experiences, career aspirations, techchnical knowledge on the field opted etc would be evaluated!
29/12/23, 10:17 am - +265 991 00 20 67: What is the period of eligibility program?
29/12/23, 10:31 am - Kunal: Can you elaborate on this?
29/12/23, 10:40 am - +265 991 00 20 67: My concern is that in a week and a couple of days from today, I will be going back to boarding school. Being in the senior class we are expected to remain in school until we write our MSCE exams which are from the 2nd to the 22nd of July 2024. This might prevent me from partaking in any other sessions or programs that will require my presence when I am away from home.
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Kunal: Let me tell you that we will be completing the procedure of eligibility in the coming week
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
29/12/23, 10:58 am - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
29/12/23, 11:26 am - +265 991 00 20 67: I like point 4 most
29/12/23, 11:36 am - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

29/12/23, 11:36 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/12/23, 12:18 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
29/12/23, 12:30 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Seems like the alternative to the "Earn While You Learn" program is beneficial. Apart from my family paying for the fee, there is no one but myself so can I opt back and agree with the program?
29/12/23, 12:32 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/12/23, 12:47 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: On behalf of my family, I am honored by what you are doing for me, thus we would like to say thank you. When it comes to my family they are supportive of my decisions regarding school. To my parents in particular, studying abroad is something beyond their expectations as well as something to make them proud of educating their daughter. My parents believe that when you educate a girl you have educated a nation.
29/12/23, 12:58 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
29/12/23, 12:58 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
29/12/23, 1:27 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: When a student wants to apply for a university abroad they need to make good decisions and research the school they plan on applying to. This includes the programs they offer, requirements and deadlines for submitting documents carefully. 

It is also required to submit copies of diplomas from your previous studies, Reference letters, Motivation letter or Statements of Purpose. Like you mentioned 
 
In addition, it is required for a student to have proof of language proficiency which might be from language certificates such as IELTS or TOEFL.
29/12/23, 1:29 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Students also have to apply online at their chosen universities and when accepted they have to schedule a visa appointment
29/12/23, 1:33 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that these are required
29/12/23, 1:33 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
29/12/23, 1:33 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
29/12/23, 1:33 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:40 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: The enrollment fee is $350?
29/12/23, 1:41 pm - Kunal: That is right
29/12/23, 1:41 pm - Kunal: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
29/12/23, 1:41 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
29/12/23, 1:41 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/12/23, 2:04 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: This is indeed good news
29/12/23, 2:09 pm - Kunal: You can address this as well
29/12/23, 2:11 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: I hope I will be found eligible to be an Edoofian
29/12/23, 2:15 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:19 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: We have discussed upto stage 6
29/12/23, 2:20 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
29/12/23, 2:20 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Please do
29/12/23, 2:24 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
29/12/23, 2:24 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.
29/12/23, 2:45 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Does this imply that the student starts school in 2026?
29/12/23, 2:45 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Followed by a gap year?
29/12/23, 2:46 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that as per your application your intake is in 2025
29/12/23, 2:47 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: That's relieving
29/12/23, 2:48 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
29/12/23, 2:48 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
29/12/23, 2:48 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

29/12/23, 2:48 pm - Kunal: For any question apart from whatever has been discussed, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has answers to most of the queries
Furthermore, if you have any other query I would suggest that you note down all of the questions and get back to me
29/12/23, 2:48 pm - Kunal: Also, I am sharing some pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program

01/01/24, 2:27 pm - Austin: Greetings dear parents and Doreen!

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Mr Kunal and learned about the program better. Now, I will guide you to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions.

01/01/24, 2:38 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
01/01/24, 5:39 pm - Austin: Good Evening to you all!
How was your day?
01/01/24, 5:42 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Good Evening Mr Austin. I believe we are all great how about you?
01/01/24, 5:44 pm - Austin: Good to hear that, Doreen!
I am doing well by the Grace of God
01/01/24, 5:44 pm - Austin: May I know did you managed to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
01/01/24, 5:46 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Yes, I have managed to discuss the Edoofa program with my family and they are happy about it 😀
01/01/24, 5:46 pm - Austin: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
01/01/24, 5:47 pm - +27 73 753 0068: Evening Mr Austin 🙏
01/01/24, 5:48 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Mrs Matapula

I hope you are doing well
01/01/24, 5:49 pm - +27 73 753 0068: I'm good and you sir
01/01/24, 5:50 pm - Austin: Good to know, I am having a good time

I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
01/01/24, 5:54 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: My family and I have discussed how we can benefit from the Edoofa program when it comes to my education in particular. We feel that the procedures and also expenses are at a fair price. We believe that the program is effective from our research as well as contacting some of the people who have experience with the program, people in the likes of Miss Valerie Rukubo and Mrs Dancila.
01/01/24, 5:58 pm - +27 73 753 0068: This hole season I have read very well so my question is that do take someone on scholarship when that person have not known her results on her exams what if that person falls the exams while you have already consider her giving that person  schorlaship is it possible
01/01/24, 5:59 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! It is good to see that you have connected to a few of our beneficiaries to have a better insight on the program through their experiences.
01/01/24, 5:59 pm - Austin: I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career.
01/01/24, 6:02 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: It was such an honor speaking with them, especially Mrs Dancila who is not far from where we reside.
01/01/24, 6:04 pm - Austin: That is a genuine concern and as mentioned in the session, the minimum academic requirement is at least 7 points in 5 subjects which is an achievable target. But we always encourage students to come out with flying colours with the best possible grades. Moreover, they will have to pass the most important eligibility check interview inorder to qualify for the Edoofa Scholarship Program where the student will have a general interview as well as a technical round concerning to the field of student along with a video interaction with the parents. So you see, it is not going to be easy for every student.

Even if Edoofians fail to meet the requirements, they have a positive path ahead. If a student qualifies as a deserving student for the Edoofa scholarship we believe that he/she has the calibre to meet the grades, so in case they fail to meet them, even then the eligibility will be valid, and students can write the exams again, gain minimum points and can join the intake. With the right needs and resources students will give their best to perform well.
01/01/24, 6:10 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Does this mean that the required points for my MSCE results have to be below 10 points?
01/01/24, 6:11 pm - +27 73 753 0068: Noted
01/01/24, 6:11 pm - Austin: No please, Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

We accept upto 7=pass for a subject. Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35. This would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program. The minimum requirement was higher before the pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered
01/01/24, 6:12 pm - Austin: Doreen, target for the best results and points to increase the chances of a Higher Quantum of Scholarship!
01/01/24, 6:13 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Wow, the clarity is excellent!
01/01/24, 6:16 pm - Austin: Perfect, do you have other questions for me?
01/01/24, 6:16 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: How does the Higher Quantum of Scholarship differ from the Higher Education, or are they the same thing?
01/01/24, 6:18 pm - Austin: Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% on tuition fees. The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
01/01/24, 6:23 pm - +27 73 753 0068: When you say that Edoofa offers 50-100 percent scholarship, does it imply that the student is likely to have 50% scholarship before the other positions of merit and academic achievements are considered?
01/01/24, 6:27 pm - Austin: That is correct, a student is guaranteed a 50% scholarship or more if qualified for the Edoofa program.
01/01/24, 6:28 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Amazing
01/01/24, 6:29 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: After acceptance into the program, when is the enrollment payment made?
01/01/24, 6:31 pm - Austin: If you qualify for the Edoofa Program, you receive the Acceptance Letter after which you are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of  $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together.
01/01/24, 6:35 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Is it possible for the payment to be made after MSCE exams?
01/01/24, 6:41 pm - Austin: In that case, you will have to re-apply after MSCE but it would depend on the availability of scholarship seats. As of now, we are receiving huge number of applications each day from 29+ countries due to which scholarship seats are filling out fast. Moreover, the Western African nations receive their results earlier than Malawi due to which chances are high that students would fill out the scholarship seats. This is the reason Central African Nations are given the opportunity to apply before results are out
01/01/24, 6:41 pm - Austin: Moreover, Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
01/01/24, 6:44 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: That has been noted ✅️
01/01/24, 6:50 pm - Austin: Are you having other questions for me, Doreen?
01/01/24, 6:57 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Oh yes. During the personalized counseling sessions, Mr Kunal mentioned that Edoofa does not offer the branch of medicine that I want to pursue as a career. Instead, he left a list of 5 available courses which included Bachelor's of Cardiovascular Technology that I selected. Does it mean that when I start University, I will study that career program or will have to apply for the one I want?
01/01/24, 7:04 pm - Austin: Let me please help you understand why Medicine is not offered under the Edoofa Scholarship. In order to study MBBS(Bachelor of Medicine-Bachelor of Surgery) in India, you need to attend the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) conducted by NTA under the government of India. This is the the only path to qualify for medicine in India and the exam is highly competitive with almost a million students attending for just 5000 seats. Students prepare for 2-3 years after their Higher secondary to clear the test after which they can study Medicine in India. This is also the reason for India producing some of the finest healthcare professionals.
01/01/24, 7:06 pm - Austin: It takes 5.5 years to complete medicine followed by a year for house surgency(internship), 3 years for Doctor of Medicine and 2-3 years for specializations in India.
01/01/24, 7:08 pm - Austin: Therefore, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we offer the career opportunities in Medical Field discussed by Mr Kunal during the session.
01/01/24, 7:08 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: I am now a little more confused. What about my selection of Cardiovascular Technology which I have been inspired by Edoofa?
01/01/24, 7:08 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Mr Kunal in particular
01/01/24, 7:09 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Oh alright.
01/01/24, 7:10 pm - Austin: The pathway that I mentioned is for MBBS and you do not have to worry about Cardiovascular technology because you will be able to pursue the course through the Edoofa Scholarship Program if you qualify
01/01/24, 7:11 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: God willing I do qualify 🙏 🙇🏽‍♀️
01/01/24, 7:11 pm - Austin: Let us hope for the best, what else would you like to ask me please?
01/01/24, 7:15 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: By far we have only been talking about expectations before being in the university chosen. What can you tell me about the living conditions of African international students like there in India?
01/01/24, 7:20 pm - Austin: Let me please help you with the same but just before that, did you manage to interact with any Edoofian here in India to learn their experiences directly?
01/01/24, 7:24 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: I managed to contact Miss Valerie but due to the New Year Festival the communication is somehow poor

01/01/24, 7:48 pm - Austin: You are welcome, Doreen!
01/01/24, 7:48 pm - Austin: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
01/01/24, 8:57 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: I will be studying for a Bachelor's in Cardiovascular Technology through the Edoofa program which is in India. 
The average cost of studying in India without a scholarship is worth 6000-8000 US dollars.
With Edoofa scholarship, I will be paying 2000-3000 US dollars annually if I am found eligible for the program.
 The enrollment fee for the program is $350 US dollars. The fee is paid in two installments. The first installment is $200 within 7 days after getting the acceptance letter, and the second should be paid within the next 30 days if found eligible for the program.
01/01/24, 8:57 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: The Earn While You Learn program is offered to students by Edoofa to help make their Higher Education affordable. Students work part-time, which enables them to have time for their studies. The Work While You Learn program helps students balance time for work and school. It also builds the student's ability to be independent as they learn to manage their finances. The program also helps the student gain practical working experiences, which prepares them for future career opportunities.
01/01/24, 8:57 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: Yes I am clear on that
01/01/24, 8:58 pm - +265 991 00 20 67: But I'd like it if you would explain
01/01/24, 9:10 pm - Austin: Good Work, Doreen!
01/01/24, 9:10 pm - Austin: The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600
