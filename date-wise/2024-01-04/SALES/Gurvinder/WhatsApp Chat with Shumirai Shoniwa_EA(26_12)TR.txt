28/12/23, 11:04 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

28/12/23, 11:20 am - Tushti: Alright so Shumirai, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background.

9. Name of your school and the province in which it is located
28/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 544 7266: I'm Shumirai Shoniwa a former student at Kutama Day High School located Zvimba , Mashonaland  West Province ,Zimbabwe. I was raised by maternal grandmother  in Zvimba rural area. My mother passed away  when l was at a very tender age , at the age of 3.My greatest strength is that I can prioritize what needs to be done first today and which tasks can wait until tomorrow. Because of this, I’m efficient with my time management and able to succeed in both school and extracurricular activities. However, my greatest weakness is that I can become too focused on one task and forget about other assignments or projects which need attention. I’ve been working on this by setting reminders in my phone throughout the day. l enjoy netball because that was my sport at school
28/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 544 7266: 1. Name of school: Kutama Day High School 
Location:   Mashonaland West Province 
2. Educational level:  Ordinary level and Advanced Level 
5 Subjects at Ordinary including: English,Science and Mathematics 
Advanced Level subjects: history, shona and divinity
 3. Course to study: Nursing because it offers me an opportunity to help old peoples and children to live longer 
4. My parent is a vendor in a growth point named Murombedzi
5.My parents level of education is standard six. 
6.My grandmother and well wishers are the ones who supported my education 
7. Yes l have siblings .they are at school primary level 
8.I'm looking for scholarships to support my education 
9. My fees per term was $50usd
28/12/23, 12:50 pm - Tushti: Noted
28/12/23, 12:50 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
28/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes
28/12/23, 1:18 pm - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
28/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 544 7266: My family will not be able pay for me to study abroad or put any money towards the studies for that reason I'm looking for scholarship to finance my studies
28/12/23, 3:02 pm - Tushti: Shumirai let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
28/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 544 7266: In that case I will apply for loan to cover expenses that are not covered by scholarship
28/12/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: Are you sure this would be financially feasible for the family?
28/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes
28/12/23, 3:24 pm - Tushti: Kindly share teh L5 and O LEVEL result pictures
28/12/23, 3:28 pm - +258 84 444 9829: Good afternoon Ms Tushti.I will sell my livestock to help Shumirai with someone of the things she might need at school
28/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 544 7266: If l send it tomorrow will it be too late because I'm far from them
28/12/23, 3:42 pm - Tushti: Noted

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
03/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 544 7266: For now l don't have any question
03/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
03/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Yes l know
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

03/01/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/01/24, 5:51 pm - +263 77 544 7266: Now l have a better understanding of Edoofa program...it's a great opportunity to me.
