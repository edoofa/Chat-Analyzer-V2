27/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 073 3676: I don't think I have the full knowledge
27/12/23, 11:08 am - Tushti: Alright, let me give you a brief introduction to the Program you have applied for
27/12/23, 11:08 am - Tushti: , *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

9. Name of your school and the province in which it is located

Harare high and its in Harare
28/12/23, 10:30 am - Tushti: Kindly mention your current subjects
28/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 073 3676: I'm doing Maths , Physics and Computer Science
28/12/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
28/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yes
28/12/23, 3:06 pm - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
28/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Does edoofa give fully funded scholarships
28/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: No
28/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: Now, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
28/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 073 3676: So u reduce tuition to what percentage
28/12/23, 4:40 pm - Tushti: The scholarships range from 50-100%
28/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 073 3676: So how do I get a 100 percent
28/12/23, 4:41 pm - Tushti: The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
28/12/23, 4:41 pm - Tushti: Even after a 100% scholarship, the family would have to cater to costs such as food, accomodation and flight tickets
28/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yeah I know , they will
28/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 073 3676: So u saying u just don't get a 100 percent u have to earn it ,

So how much percentage are u given at first
28/12/23, 4:44 pm - Tushti: You shall know the scholarship percentage once you have cleared all rounds of the selection process
28/12/23, 5:31 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Ooh okay I understand ,
29/12/23, 9:35 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
29/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 073 3676: Yes we can
29/12/23, 11:46 am - Tushti: So, has the family decided to proceed with the application or withdraw it?
29/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Proceed
29/12/23, 12:40 pm - Tushti: I would like to get a confirmation from the parent
29/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 073 3676: K
29/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 269 3093: How are you all , I'm blesseds mom and would like to continue and hope he will get the scholarship and I will be able to afford anything else needed
29/12/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: Would you be able to raise around $2000 per yearfor the annual fee after scholarship?
29/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 269 3093: Yes indeed , I will be able
29/12/23, 2:00 pm - Tushti: Noted

02/01/24, 1:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal added Gurvinder
02/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon, Everyone!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa.*

*Happy New Year to you and your family.*

As Ms Tushti is under the weather and won't be joining us for some time, she has asked me to continue with your application to move ahead with priority.
02/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Okae I'm ready to continue
02/01/24, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great @263780733676 I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
02/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yes sir I'm willing to give my best and exceed my limits and grab each and every opportunity that comes my way
02/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 78 073 3676: One of the major reasons I would like to study abroad if for me to study abroad is expanding horizons immersing myself in a new culture can help me break down preconceived notions and offer fresh perspectives on the world and myself. 
Being away from home encourages self-reliance, resourcefulness, and problem-solving skills. And that will help me become an independent being without much help and support from my parents and family.
I will also be able to access specialized programs, unique courses, or world-renowned universities not available in my home country.
Studying abroad will help me connect with individuals abroad which can later open doors to future career opportunities for me.
Studying abroad will enhance my employability by demonstrating adaptability, intercultural competence, and global awareness.
Employers in my country increasingly value international experience and its associated skills so it will be an advantage for me.
02/01/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
02/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Studying abroad can offer valuable experiences and perspectives that can contribute to improving the education system in my native country in several ways such as exposure to diverse teaching methods I will encounter alternative approaches to learning, assessment, and curriculum design, potentially sparking innovative ideas for our own education system.
One of the things I will be able to do is study programs unavailable in my home country which can bring new expertise to my field of work, enriching the overall talent pool.
02/01/24, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community @263780733676 , but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
02/01/24, 3:25 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yeah I agree
02/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
02/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yes
02/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
02/01/24, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

02/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yeah I have understood,  for now I have non questions , u have already answered my question
02/01/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
02/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Hmm it would be a no ,
02/01/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
02/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Okay I'm all ears
02/01/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Before that, can you please share the course that Ms Tushti offered you?
02/01/24, 3:37 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Computer Science
02/01/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Please state the full name of the course.
02/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 78 073 3676: B.Tech Computer Science Engineering
02/01/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
02/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
02/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Okay I fully understand now
02/01/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
02/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yes u can
02/01/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: @263780733676 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
02/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Ooh okay
02/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Its a helpful program
02/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
02/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
02/01/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

02/01/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
02/01/24, 3:54 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yeah I think it will benefit me for i will have guidance from people who have experience
02/01/24, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @263780733676 , moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Okay I understand , the effort u put determines how much scholarship credits u get
02/01/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/01/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
02/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yes something i have been looking for
02/01/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263780733676 , now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
02/01/24, 3:59 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yes
02/01/24, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
02/01/24, 4:00 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yes I have and my mother is pleased with the earn program , I added her in the group and she's in support
02/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
02/01/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yes I am
02/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: @263780733676 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Thats would be 1500-2250
02/01/24, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly @263780733676 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/01/24, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Okae we thank you
02/01/24, 4:05 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Can see how edoofa makes it easier
02/01/24, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yeah I think so too , I can see that
02/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: @263780733676 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
02/01/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
02/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Okay I understand
02/01/24, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
02/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 78 073 3676: No I'm not familiar with the edoofa cycle
02/01/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263780733676 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
02/01/24, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Yeah I understand
02/01/24, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
02/01/24, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
02/01/24, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
02/01/24, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
02/01/24, 4:25 pm - +263 78 073 3676: Noo don't have any questions , if I come up with any will ask, but for now I understand the cycle
02/01/24, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
02/01/24, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/01/24, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
