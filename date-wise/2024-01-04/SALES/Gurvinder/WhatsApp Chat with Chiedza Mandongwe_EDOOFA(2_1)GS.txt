*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
02/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 77 488 4699: I am online sir
02/01/24, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Chiedza,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

02/01/24, 9:42 am - +263 77 488 4699: And a pleasant day to Mr Shubham and Mr Jyotishman
02/01/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Chiedza, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from John, is that correct?
02/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 488 4699: This message was deleted
02/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 488 4699: Yes, that is correct
02/01/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from John, also do tell me whether you learnt about John’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
02/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 488 4699: Okay. Edoofa Scholarship Program is an innovative program initiated by
Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. with a deep focus on fixing higher education, and making it accessible, affordable and making it the path for increasing employability of every student part of your organization. Over the last 25years it is observed that the Industrial Sector has grown almost at a rate of 40% because of the technological developments across the globe. 
 
However at the same time the Education System around the world has only grown at a rate of 5% because of which the unemployment gap has risen massively too. 

To bridge this gap and to reduce this magnificent gap in employment the Program was born. It’s primary focus is on providing education which is accessible, and employable. Which means, every student part of your  family, is empowered enough and coached enough with relevant skills, that they can find their own path to finding a job. 

So this is a scholarship program where l can pursue Tertiary education at the best premier colleges in India with more than 250 courses offered from diverse fields.
02/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
02/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
02/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
02/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
02/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 488 4699: As per John’s experience, he saw that tuition fee at the University of Zimbabwe was quite pricey. He wanted to help his family so he talked to some of his seniors and he got to learn about Edoofa Scholarship Program. He got to learn about the work while you learn Program and he followed the 5’S which helped him qualify for the Edoofa Scholarship Program
02/01/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
02/01/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
02/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 77 488 4699: Yes it is
02/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Chiedza, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
02/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 488 4699: Yes I do have what it takes
02/01/24, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now Chiedza, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
