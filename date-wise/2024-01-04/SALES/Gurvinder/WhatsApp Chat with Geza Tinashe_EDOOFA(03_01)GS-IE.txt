*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student Abigail

Since you have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Abigail , please reach out to your friend to understand their complete journey and views on the program to attain greater clarity and understanding about the program. In the meantime, can you also please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?
03/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 696 3527: You mean the question which were on the form
03/01/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: The questions that Abigail might have shared with you.
03/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 696 3527: Mmmm I was given the application form by Manjenjenje
03/01/24, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
03/01/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Manjenjenje, also do tell me whether you learnt about Manjenjenje’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
03/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 696 3527: Well I didn't chat with Manjenjenje that much but I learnt people in the Edoofa scholarship program are very helpful for example Mrs Manjenjenje helped me a lot she was patient with me and taught me some few things and according to the videos sent in the Edoofa scholarship program group it seems the students who come from other countries besides India are being treated well
03/01/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
03/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship  as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
03/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 696 3527: No she didn't
03/01/24, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
03/01/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tinashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 



In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
03/01/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 696 3527: Ohh so you mean my parents must participate in this group
03/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, they should be active.
03/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 77 530 9893: Am the parent I would like to know requirements
03/01/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you, please refer to this.
03/01/24, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
