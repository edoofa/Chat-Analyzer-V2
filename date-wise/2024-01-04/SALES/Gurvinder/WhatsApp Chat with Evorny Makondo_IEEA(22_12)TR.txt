23/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 840 4588: The founders of Edoofa Scholarship Program are Indians and they bring African students here in India to pursue their higher studies
23/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 840 4588: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* 

▫️The Edoofa Scholarship Program is a transformative initiative aimed at providing *Quality International Tertiary* Education to deserving students, particularly from Africa. 
▫️Managed by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions* Pvt. Ltd. founded by *Mr.Angad and Mr.Avreen Singh* , the program addresses the challenges of both *affordability* and *employability* that many students face in pursuing tertiary education.

▫️Key Features of the Edoofa Scholarship Program:

*1. Affordable Education:*

▫️Imagine having the opportunity to pursue your dream education without the burden of very high tuition fees. 
▫️Edoofa provides scholarships covering 50-80% of tuition costs, ensuring that financial constraints don't stand between you and a Quality International Education.
▫️ Studying in India without the scholarship granted by Edoofa is way too expensive and may cost around $7000-$8000 per year

✅ However, after the Edoofa Scholarship's fund, on average, a student would need a range of *$2000-$3000* per year including all academic and living expenses.
▫️Through the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa gives you the opportunity to alleviate the financial burden even more, by participating in online projects and earning scholarship credits.
