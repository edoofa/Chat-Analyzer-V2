18/11/23, 10:00 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your mother to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. I she facing such a situation?

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
11/12/23, 5:27 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 9:23 am - Tushti: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
12/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 823 3855: Mam morning we can start
12/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 823 3855: Yes we can start
12/12/23, 9:39 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
12/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 823 3855: No no-one is aware
12/12/23, 9:49 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
12/12/23, 9:49 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/12/23, 9:49 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/12/23, 9:50 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 9:51 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 9:51 am - Tushti: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 823 3855: Ok this amount is payed per year
12/12/23, 10:16 am - Tushti: That is correct
12/12/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: I would now like for your parents to go through this information and let me know ehther they have any questions
12/12/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: Kindly ask them to come online
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 823 3855: Okae
