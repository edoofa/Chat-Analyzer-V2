03/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
03/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Tapiwanashe who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
03/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 71 250 1277: He did. He'd stipulated a (50-100)% quantum.
03/01/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Junior, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 



In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
03/01/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, I think you will adhere to the above two quantifiers. Do you have any limitations that may hinder you and your Parents from being online for at least TWO-THREE hours today?
03/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 71 250 1277: My mom will be available but my father is usually working throughout the entirety of the day, so he's barely ever free.
03/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Now Junior, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
03/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you Mr. Gurvinder. In about a month's worth of time, my highest qualification will be Ordinary levels, I have already sat for them in the November 2023 session of the ZIMSEC examination council and I'm waiting for the publication of the results. I was hoping to pursue courses in finance and business management (I'm not exactly sure of the courses offered, but that's the field). My father is a security manager at Zialandia Mine in Midlands Zimbabwe and my mother is an Event Planner. My parents highest educational level is Ordinary levels. My parents have been supporting my education so far. I'm hoping the scholarship would be able to support my finances if I get the opportunity to study abroad. I have 3 siblings, the oldest William is a confectioner at Spar supermarket in Cape Town South Africa, my sister, Mercy is an Office Manager working in her capacity as a secretary at a private boarding school in Chivhu called Livingproof High School and lastly, my brother, Praise who is also currently waiting for his final semester results for his BSc. Hons. in Applied Mathematics from the national university of science and technology. I was studying at Zvishavane High School in Midlands province at US$60.00 per term. <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know about you Junior.
03/01/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel like you have a close-knit family, so don't you think, your siblings should also be a part of this session?
03/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Indeed we're close-knit but my oldest brother's profession like my father's does not allow him to be on any social media platform during the day. My sister can be part of the procession. I am currently using my brother, Praise's phone, so him and I cannot be online at the same time.
03/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, can you please add your sister and ask her to introduce herself.
03/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Alright

03/01/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 700 8692: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Mercy Nesvinga. I'm Junior's immediate older sister. I'm an office manager working in my capacity as a secretary at Livingproof High School in Chivhu Zimbabwe
03/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you Ms Nesvinga.
03/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study finance and business management, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
03/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 71 250 1277: For me, studying a course inline with finance and business management is about more than just earning a degree. It's about gaining the skills and knowledge that will allow me to succeed in an industry that is constantly changing and evolving. I am drawn to the challenge of working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, and I am excited by the opportunities that this field offers. I also believe that business and finance have the potential to make a positive impact on the world, and I am eager to play a role in that. Ultimately, I am motivated by the prospect of making a difference in the world through my work as others who've come before me have. <This message was edited>

Her work ethic and overall perspective and appreciation of the financial world is quite quintessential to her overall success in her endeavours and that is the closest I have to any relations in the field.
03/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: It's great to hear about your inspiration from your mother's work ethic and her perspective on financial aspects, even if she's not directly in the finance and business management field. Sometimes, indirect influence can be just as impactful in shaping our aspirations and work ethics.

03/01/24, 3:02 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I'm still waiting for the results. I sat for my O Levels in November. The results haven't been published yet.
