15/12/23, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, let me also brief you about the program.
15/12/23, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/12/23, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/12/23, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
15/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
15/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

15/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/12/23, 5:59 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes I am, I'm  looking for a chance to become independent and  to take  little responsibility of my education and my parents financial burned.

16/12/23, 8:36 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
16/12/23, 9:26 am - +260 95 5956785: Good morning, thank you
16/12/23, 9:48 am - +260 97 9151577: good morning
16/12/23, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Ntali, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
16/12/23, 11:26 am - +260 97 9151577: I believe I do have what it takes
16/12/23, 3:49 pm - +260 95 5956785: How long does the corporate law course take?
16/12/23, 4:11 pm - +260 95 5956785: And Once the cource is completed  do you help in finding employment for them?
16/12/23, 8:30 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

18/12/23, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:
*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.
*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.
*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.
*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.
A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

19/12/23, 4:31 pm - +260 97 9151577: I see myself a capable lawyer able to take on real life cases ,defending and protecting justice in the company I'm working. I see myself as an example to people  that anything is possible (there dreams )through God and hard work. I will be able to help make the laws that govern companies with an active hand . I will be able to take on cases with the seriousness and responsibility they deserve. if I get into the Edoofa programme I can be able to achieve the mentioned goals. by attending school at a well established university with a concious that I'm responsible for my own tuition fees .Giving me the courage and the confidence to take on cases outside school .This programme I believe will push me to be the better me each day I'm there .

20/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Ntali I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
20/12/23, 9:50 am - +260 97 9151577: thank you and yes I'm willing to work my hardest
20/12/23, 9:51 am - +260 97 9151577: good morning
20/12/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/12/23, 9:54 am - +260 97 9151577: I believe studying abroad will get me into a university faster than it would here. I also want a chance to visit a place I have never been.
20/12/23, 11:01 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
20/12/23, 11:42 am - +260 97 9151577: I would attribute my success to edoofa programme for helping me and sharing ideas with other lawyers about the aspect of quality education and hopeful my success will be of great influence to the education system. With help from others I'm sure I will be able to make a difference
20/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Ntali, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
20/12/23, 12:18 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes sir I agree and working hard will give me that reputation achieved by competing to be the best
20/12/23, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
20/12/23, 12:52 pm - +260 97 9151577: now that you have mentioned it ,I asking the very question
20/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

20/12/23, 1:45 pm - +260 97 9151577: well this is more than I knew about India ,and its very promising
20/12/23, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: So now Ntali, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
20/12/23, 2:04 pm - +260 97 9151577: do u have specific university you are associated with in India
20/12/23, 2:04 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes I do understand the quality
20/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: There are a number of globally recognized Universities, Ntali.
20/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
20/12/23, 2:11 pm - +260 97 9151577: no, I don't have any idea
20/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
20/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/12/23, 2:22 pm - +260 97 9151577: even though I'm not paying my own fees that sounds like a good bargain
20/12/23, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Can you elaborate, what do you mean by that.
20/12/23, 2:34 pm - +260 97 9151577: its a good offer compared to other countries, India is a good place to get quality education at a lower price
20/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
20/12/23, 2:46 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes please
20/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Ntali, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/12/23, 3:11 pm - +260 97 9151577: I understand it and i cant wait to have first hand experience of it ,if I get the scholarship
20/12/23, 3:12 pm - +260 97 9151577: thank you for explaining
20/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
20/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

20/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/12/23, 3:34 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes I think it will benefit me in the best way like pushing me to work hard each time I'm doing work .I think this program will give me exposure to the outside world and it will help me interact and learn from others
20/12/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Ntali, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/12/23, 3:42 pm - +260 97 9151577: okay so all the money I earn goes into my fees
20/12/23, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct.
20/12/23, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/12/23, 4:13 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes it is, with the program is internship needed ?
20/12/23, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL program in not mandatory, but won't you want to reduce the financial burden on your parents?
20/12/23, 4:28 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes I would
20/12/23, 4:28 pm - +260 97 9151577: my question is even after the EWYL program is internship needed ?
20/12/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: No, that is totally your wish.
20/12/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Ntali, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
20/12/23, 4:30 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes they will
20/12/23, 4:30 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
20/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 97 9151577: not really in depth
20/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 97 9151577: what aspects am I supposed to consider ?
20/12/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: Please, I mean have you discussed with them about studying through Edoofa in India?
20/12/23, 4:37 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes
20/12/23, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
20/12/23, 4:43 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes
20/12/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: Ntali as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/12/23, 4:45 pm - +260 97 9151577: $1500-$2250
20/12/23, 4:46 pm - +260 97 9151577: for application
20/12/23, 4:46 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Ntali, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/12/23, 4:46 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:48 pm - +260 97 9151577: okay
20/12/23, 4:48 pm - +260 97 9151577: the 350 is valid until 30th December ?
20/12/23, 4:49 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
20/12/23, 4:49 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/12/23, 4:50 pm - +260 97 9151577: I do .
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
20/12/23, 4:57 pm - +260 97 9151577: alright , so I get a chance to earn cradit even as I am here ?
20/12/23, 4:58 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
20/12/23, 4:59 pm - +260 97 9151577: alright ,thank you
20/12/23, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
20/12/23, 5:02 pm - +260 97 9151577: is it all the phases ?
20/12/23, 5:05 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 5:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Ntali, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
20/12/23, 5:05 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - +260 97 9151577: yes I do

20/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*.

20/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
20/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
20/12/23, 5:15 pm - +260 97 9151577: no thank you

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

 War in one house can never end well, Rwanda being that house had wars between two tribes Tutsi and Hutus that lasted 3 years.The mass killings of the tutsis was caused by ethnic differences and prejudice. The hutus thrived over the tutsis and a majority of them were killed .
  The wars that went on for years affected various parts of the country economically and in terms of freedom and safety.The people of Rwanda wondered if a difference was going to be their ,if a better day was going to come each day.Many people of Rwanda ended up running away from the country and seeking asylum in other countries reducing its population tenfold.
 This threat to there safety caused then to leave their economical way of life which then had a major toll on the economy as a whole . More than 500000 Tutsi were killed during this time . When they themselves lost hope along with the rest of the world a light shone on the face of Rwanda and the wars stopped. Despite the killers stopping, they were already back set on their economic structure, their government system and the order of everything. The people of Rwanda still lived in fear of the return of such happening. The world thought they couldn't get back to their feet again then,in the shortest period of time they had their feet to the ground and started to rise above the damaged caused.
  The people of Rwanda and their government started to work on the country as a whole , their transport systems have been recognized worldwide and is one of the few in Africa as at now.
 Their past has laid out a path for peace in the country to thrive making it one of the many peaceful countries in Africa,16 years ago Rwanda was not a place to be .
 Their innovative minds have been housed by the schools they have that were not their a while back.inter trade was unable to thrive because of these conditions. The people of Rwanda have a greater understanding of each other more than ever and have experience if that ever happens again
26/12/23, 7:02 pm - +260 97 9151577: My inspirational story 
As a child my one dream was to become wealthy as I grow up wealth became more than just a dream or as easy as it was to just say it .I realized its obtained through hard work and discipline.I so much wanted to be a pilot since I was a child but unfortunately the odds were not in my favour. But I have another option which was law,growing up I like to watch the series law and order.As funny as it may be my aspiration was also influenced by the tv shows I watched ,I thought to myself if they can manage to do it what is stopping me.My father told me something like that when I was younger, he said with my own words efforts differentiate success. Those words replay in my head each time I do something .I set my goal to be a lawyer in that field and I wish to advance to criminal law in due time .Ultimately I want to fly a plane one day no matter how long it will take ,with a building block of law I believe I can get to that goal and help the people I cant help now.My parents have been the major role models and teachers in my life because no matter what situation we go through the find a way to get through it and later smile at the end of the day.I want to be an example to others and reason for other to work towards their goals. Just today I have learnt from someone that nothing comes easy and he has become an example to me of innovation and hardwork ,I with to be that person in someone's life...

27/12/23, 8:06 am - +260 95 5956785: From the programme Director's letter,       my understanding is that,
We as parents play an important role in deciding of our child's career options for tertiary education.
We as parents should provide emotional support, and encouragement to our child through  decision making process.
As parents we can also help to gather information about various tertiary education options, that includes universities, colleges, vocational programmes etc,
We should also research together, and talk to parents who have their kids studying at local universities, and most importantly note down the challenges they faced in terms of fee hikes.
My understanding is also that we as parents have the role to play in helping our child in identifying their strengths, interests,and weaknesses.
We are also to work together as a family to create a budget that outlines our financial plan.
My understanding is also to encourage the child as he reaches adulthood to be responsible in his decisions, we should also be flexible,and open minded if our child's interests or goals change during their tertiary education.

02/01/24, 10:22 am - +260 97 9151577: good morning

02/01/24, 10:41 am - +260 95 5956785: The session went on well
02/01/24, 10:42 am - Shubham Madhwal: So the Program Director Mr Abhinav updated me that you wanted to discuss with your family yesterday, May I know if you managed to do that and how did the discussion go?
02/01/24, 10:48 am - +260 95 5956785: We had a very productive discussion, and we agreed that in an event that our son is given a scholarship we'll give Ntali all the support he needs.
02/01/24, 10:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: So I would like to tell you that after your discussion with the Program Director, Mr Abhinav and I and the Edoofa Academic Board had a brief discussion regarding Ntali's scholarship application

02/01/24, 6:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 7:24 pm - +260 95 5956785: Thank you
03/01/24, 9:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Ntali, Mr and Mrs Chapeshamano @260979151577 @260977662181 @260955956785, How are you?
03/01/24, 10:07 am - +260 95 5956785: Good morning. we're fine thank you
03/01/24, 10:54 am - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please
03/01/24, 10:54 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
03/01/24, 11:09 am - +260 95 5956785: Thank you for asking.

1. Which city/town is the University located.

2. At which stage do we know the percentage of Chama's scholarship 

3. Are your students allowed to stay in the campus while on break. 

4. In terms of travelling, does a child/student need to be accompanied or you do handle that process.  By saying process, I mean do you prove guidance on how to get there?
03/01/24, 11:29 am - +260 95 5956785: 5. You also mentioned that the deadline for payment of registration fees is 2nd and 3rd January, 2024, so what happens to us, since we are still waiting for Ntalis acceptance letter.
03/01/24, 11:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: 1. The Edoofa Scholarship Program is affiliated with 250+ Universities, And all the 250+ Universities are UGC (University Grants Commission) and AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) approved meaning the student after completion of the course can work anywhere in the globe.
- Lovely Professional University 
- Uttrakhand Technical University
- Punjab Technical University
- Galgotias University 
- Gulzar Group of Institutions
There are various other universities, as well as the list, goes on and on
03/01/24, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2.  As you may recall from the counselling session, the counsellor informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with our special recommendation, as indicated, Ntali was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$1800), as mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
03/01/24, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Ntali's potential. I firmly believe that if students like her are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.
03/01/24, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. Yes please, the student can definitely stay at the campus while on break.
03/01/24, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
03/01/24, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
03/01/24, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cover the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
03/01/24, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 5. Please that there was a hypothetical deadline provided to you, The final deadline that you will have to follow will be mentioned In Ntali's acceptance letter. Which will be shared with you by today!
03/01/24, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope all your questions were answered?
03/01/24, 12:16 pm - +260 95 5956785: Thank you for answering our questions.
03/01/24, 1:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any other  questions you would like to ask?
03/01/24, 2:29 pm - +260 95 5956785: At the moment no.
03/01/24, 2:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please, So Ntali's acceptance letter will be shared with you shortly, I will keep you updated with the progress!
03/01/24, 2:34 pm - +260 95 5956785: Thank you.
03/01/24, 2:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 
It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent!!
03/01/24, 2:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 4:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you have managed to go through the video by now?
03/01/24, 5:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 5:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So  Ntali, Mr and Mrs Chapeshamano @260979151577 @260977662181 @260955956785 the acceptance letter has been shared with you via email. I am sharing the same here with you in the group as well for your convenience.
