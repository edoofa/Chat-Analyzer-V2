27/12/23, 12:33 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:33 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 584 7586: No
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - Tushti: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 584 7586: Intresting
27/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: What are your parents thoughts on the costs?
27/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 314 0052: the cost are quite affordable and we can manage to pay
27/12/23, 2:43 pm - Tushti: Now let me brief you about the EWYL Program
27/12/23, 2:43 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
27/12/23, 2:44 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/12/23, 2:44 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/12/23, 2:44 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
27/12/23, 3:15 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
27/12/23, 5:44 pm - +263 71 584 7586: Yes we are
27/12/23, 5:51 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:37 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
28/12/23, 4:45 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 584 7586: Am very sory l was experiencing electric issues
29/12/23, 9:35 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
29/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 584 7586: Yes we can
29/12/23, 9:51 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that *you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.*

Are you ready?
29/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 71 584 7586: Yes
29/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 314 0052: it's okay
29/12/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: Mitchell, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 584 7586: $1500_$2250
29/12/23, 11:38 am - Tushti: Exactly Mitchell, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/12/23, 11:39 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:39 am - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/12/23, 11:39 am - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 71 584 7586: Yes
29/12/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/12/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
29/12/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
29/12/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: Are you able to understand?
29/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 71 584 7586: Yes l am
29/12/23, 12:42 pm - Tushti: Does your parent have any questions?
29/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 314 0052: no
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: Alright Mitchell, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
29/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 584 7586: No
29/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
29/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *on 2nd Jnauary at 2 pm* Mr Shubham would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
29/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!
