I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer* 


We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Kooji*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the application form which you submitted and what I was able to understand from the same!
03/01/24, 10:58 am - +260 97 5610521: Good Day Sir, Yes you have contacted the right person.

03/01/24, 11:58 am - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Kooji?*
03/01/24, 12:15 pm - +260 97 5610521: *What motivated me to apply for Edoofa.* 
I've always had the interest to study abroad because I believe it would grant me the opportunity to access better academic opportunities that might not be available in my own country. It also grants me the opportunity to learn about different cultures as I'll be exposed to different people during my study .

 *What I understand about the program.* 
He told me, he knew about the program here in Zambia during one of the visits of the people from the University. Which is for June/July intake. He said he had been tasked to recommend more people to apply for the schoolarship which would increase his schoolarship points. He also mentioned that the schoolarship would be given to an individual based on ones patents financial state.  But I'd love to learn more about it from you.

Thank You.

Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..
03/01/24, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia

Like Wabei had said earlier, we believe her studying abroad will be an opening to more academic opportunities that she might not get here in Zambia. It’ll also expose her to learning different cultures and peoples way of life which will broaden her exposure. <This message was edited>

03/01/24, 5:29 pm - +260 97 5610521: My name is Wabei Mununga from Zambia. I am 18 years old born on 5th March 2005. I am from Solwezi in the North Western Part of Zambia. I completed my high school (grade 12) last year so I am currently waiting for my results which are scheduled to come out this Month.

I’m interested in engineering and would therefore love to study Civil Engineering to be specific .  My moms highest level of education is high school, she is currently a business lady while my dad works under Zambia Army as a Soldier. 
Both my parents have been supporting my education so far and am sure they will do the same for my higher education.

I am the last born in a family of four. I have one sister who is the eldest and two brothers. My sister works as a nurse, the second born is still In school and my immediate elder brother also joined the army right after high school which is  where he’s currently working.

I completed my high school education at Legacy School based here in North Western. Once my results are out, I am looking forward to being accepted at one of the Universities under the Edoofa Scholarship which will be a great opportunity to further my education.

Thank you so much.
03/01/24, 5:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth?
