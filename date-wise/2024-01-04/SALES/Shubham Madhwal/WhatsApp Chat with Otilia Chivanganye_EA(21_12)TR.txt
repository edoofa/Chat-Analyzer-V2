23/12/23, 11:30 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 371 5315: Yes it is
23/12/23, 11:39 am - Tushti: Alright so Otilia, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

23/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 371 5315: I'm Otilia Chivanganye .A girl aged 18 , I have completed my "O"and level and am now waiting for my "A" level results .My strength is in that I am a fast writer , physically talented, critical thinker and I critically solve problems. My weakenes is that I am a shy but for me to hide my shyness I try by all means to be confident and I'm also an emotional person . I like running , playing handball and reading as my hobbies, this year even managed to go to provincial participating in running . I can not also refer my family as a poor family but my father try by all means to bring food on the table , so that we cannot sleep hungry .
23/12/23, 12:10 pm - Tushti: Do provide all the details
23/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 371 5315: I have completed my "A"level this year and I am now waiting for the results with the combination of Business studies, Economics and Textile Technology and Design . I want to be one of the students who study Bachelor's of science honours degree in fashion clothing design, I liked this course because since my childhood I always have passion in Textiles and I was also motivated with my mother's friend who is a tailor but my dream is to be more than my mother's friend and became a well known designer improving my economy . My father is a security guard , he didn't get money to complete his secondary level so he drope doing his form 3 and my mother is house wife ,she also experienced a school dropout doing her form 1. I am a third born in family of four , my sister is married with two kids , my brother is a civil servant in military and my little sister is about to start her form 1 next year. My father is our breadwinner and he was the one who always supports in my education and I think my brother will also take a part in supporting but am not 100% sure since he is now married .  I used to pay $25 per term since my form 1 at Hippo Valley High school in Masvingo Province
23/12/23, 12:26 pm - Tushti: Thank you
23/12/23, 12:26 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
23/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 371 5315: Yes they are

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
26/12/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 371 5315: Yes i am willing to do all things and to be a hard working student
26/12/23, 11:09 am - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
26/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 371 5315: The reason is that , through studying abroad, I can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards my higher education by myself and help my parents reduce the financial burden and I am sure that if I study here in my country I won't be able to do  so since there is rampant inflation ,whereby there is a fee hike almost every year
26/12/23, 11:40 am - Tushti: I see
26/12/23, 11:40 am - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
26/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 371 5315: From my research, I've found that in India there is high quality education and I've also found that in south africa there is a well-known doctor who studied in india , I forgot the name . So I think that if I managed to do my studies in india I will be more experienced than before and I'm sure that I will be an experienced designer to fulfill my dreams
26/12/23, 12:18 pm - Tushti: Very well researched Otilia. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

26/12/23, 12:35 pm - Tushti: Amazing Otilia, as I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
26/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 371 5315: Yes , we know that  studying without any scholarship has higher costs especially on my program
26/12/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/12/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: In simple words Otilia, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 371 5315: I understand Ms Tushti
26/12/23, 1:00 pm - Tushti: Does your parent have any question?
26/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 481 2128: So far as a parent  I don't have any question
26/12/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you about teh EWYL Program
26/12/23, 1:48 pm - Tushti: That is really great NAME I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
26/12/23, 1:48 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/12/23, 1:48 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/12/23, 1:49 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
26/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 371 5315: Yes I was really looking for this
26/12/23, 1:55 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that *you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.*

Are you ready?
26/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 371 5315: Yes
26/12/23, 2:03 pm - Tushti: Is the parent online?

26/12/23, 2:28 pm - Tushti: Otilia, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 481 2128: $1500-$2250 

It's otilia who is replying using parent's phone
26/12/23, 2:33 pm - Tushti: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/12/23, 2:33 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:33 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
26/12/23, 2:33 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 481 2128: Is this money going to be paid for the application only
26/12/23, 2:35 pm - Tushti: This is answered here
26/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 481 2128: Yes I think so too
26/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 481 2128: So let's say I have payed this $750 , am I going to be 100% sure that I have qualified in the Edoofa program
26/12/23, 2:41 pm - Tushti: The amount is $350, please
26/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 481 2128: I am sorry for the misunderstanding
26/12/23, 5:30 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
26/12/23, 5:30 pm - Tushti: So, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
26/12/23, 5:30 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
26/12/23, 5:30 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
26/12/23, 5:30 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 5:31 pm - Tushti: Alright Otilia, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
26/12/23, 5:31 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
26/12/23, 5:31 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
26/12/23, 5:31 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
26/12/23, 5:31 pm - Tushti: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 5:31 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
26/12/23, 5:31 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
26/12/23, 5:31 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

28/12/23, 9:34 am - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

28/12/23, 10:37 am - Tushti: Do you feel you are finncially prepared?
28/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 481 2128: Yes
28/12/23, 10:48 am - Tushti: Would you be able to make the payments in 7 days, in case Otilia gets selected?
28/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 481 2128: Yes I am able
28/12/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: Noted <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 10:51 am - Tushti: So, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that Otilia would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
28/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 371 5315: Bachelor's of science honours degree in fashion clothing design is the name of my course and the country is India . The average cost without a scholarship is around$6000- $8000. Then the annual fee will be $2000-$3000 and the enrollment fee is $350 and it is not paid at the same time,$200 in 7 days time then $150 in 30 days  time .


About this Earn While You Learn program I understood that for example if an annual fee for a student is $2200 and then that  student managed to to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month , this means that you can earn $1200 in a year ,and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student's education would be somewhere between $90-$100
28/12/23, 11:46 am - Tushti: The questions have to be answered by the parent
28/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 371 5315: Ok
