22/11/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Good Morning Tariro, Mr.C.Sigireta!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Good morning
22/11/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Tariro,

You can address me as Mr Singh, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Same here ,it's also my pleasure thank you for connecting with me
22/11/23, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Tariro, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Rejoice, is that correct?
22/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 825 3252: No 

Persistence Muza
22/11/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
22/11/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Persistence, also do tell me whether you learnt about Persistence’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
22/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Reflecting on my experience as a proud member of the Edoofa family, I recall discovering the program in 2021 during my final year through Facebook. Initially cautious due to the prevalence of online scams, my perception shifted when a friend based in India introduced me to Edoofa. Intrigued by the opportunity, I swiftly submitted my application and engaged in insightful counseling sessions arranged by Edoofa counselors. These sessions illuminated the program's benefits, emphasizing the advantages of pursuing higher education in India.

Having gained confidence in the program's authenticity, I met the eligibility criteria, paid the enrollment fees, and fulfilled all necessary documentation. After receiving multiple offers from different institutions, I decided on Lovely Professional University. This choice entailed navigating through various formalities—visa, passport, medical tests, etc.—culminating in my departure on July 26, 2022. Presently, I find myself in my second year, pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at Lovely Professional University, one of India's distinguished educational institutions.
22/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Not so detailed but this little description boosted confidence in me that  Edoofa will help me persue my studies
22/11/23, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: Sigireta, Let me brief you about the program.
22/11/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22/11/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/11/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
22/11/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 825 3252: That's true
22/11/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tariro, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
22/11/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
22/11/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
22/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Yes
22/11/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Tariro, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

The law field has limited job opportunities in comparison to other fields like Commerce and Science. Law Graduates are hired in many different sectors of the industry as Business Development Manager with various Law firms, Finance and Management Accountant cum Legal Advisor, Working as an Advocate pursuing Corporate Litigation with other Practicing Advocates and Articles.
22/11/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
22/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Yes
22/11/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 825 3252: I'm seeing myself as an independent girl who can take part in different sectors of industries which include business, law , finance and management accountant etc and Edoofa's program will enable me to archive my dreams since it'll help me persue my education. And Edoofa is helping with career guidance so I'm sure I'll never be lost since people all over the word a being helped .I'm just imagining myself as one of the best students in law field
22/11/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Since my country is still developing , there are very few universities so there are very limited opportunities of taking part in the field you really admire. I promise if given a chance I will never let down Edoofa since it will give me an opportunity to follow my dreams
22/11/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
22/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Once I graduate , I will contribute fully using the knowledge given from Edoofa. Also to participate in programs of my field in my country's universities.
22/11/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Sigireta, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
22/11/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you agree?
22/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 825 3252: I do agree
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/11/23, 4:52 pm - Gurvinder: Well Sigireta, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care, address my question, and do watch the video I am sharing below.

23/11/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

Interesting
23/11/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: So now Sigireta, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 825 3252: No
23/11/23, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 825 3252: We're not familiar with the costs
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/11/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Okay
23/11/23, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Sigireta what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 825 3252: I understand
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Yes so that I understand in detail
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Sigireta, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 825 3252: So through this EWYL program, my fees will be paid in full or my parents will have to pay a certain amount
23/11/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Let me continue, your doubt will be addressed just in a few moments.
23/11/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

23/11/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/11/23, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

23/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Okay
23/11/23, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/11/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: Well Sigireta, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Yes this will benefit me since I will be learning whilst experiencing my career. Also Edoofa will give me access to quality education at an affordable fees
23/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Thank you sir same to you , it was my pleasure getting to know more about Edoofa
24/11/23, 8:31 am - Gurvinder: Greetings Everyone,

*"All our dreams can come true; if we have the courage to pursue them."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
24/11/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 825 3252: Greetings , yes we can begin
24/11/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Sigireta, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
24/11/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 71 825 3252: Following
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/11/23, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
24/11/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
24/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Exactly, it is something I have been looking for regarding my international education
24/11/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Sigireta, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
24/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 825 3252: What about the EWYL program?
24/11/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, the EWYL program will help you self-finance a major part of your fees but I am asking that after that I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
24/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Okay , yes they will
24/11/23, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
24/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 825 3252: We haven't discussed in depth
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, do remember to discuss this whole session with your family.
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Yes I'm ready
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Sigireta as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 825 3252: They will spend about $1500-$2250
24/11/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Sigireta, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/11/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Sigireta, I would advise you to stay online for 10 minutes as we are just at the end of the counselling session.
24/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Noted
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you think so?
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 825 3252: I do think so
24/11/23, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/11/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Sigireta basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
24/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Following
24/11/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: However Sigireta, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Okay ,following
24/11/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
24/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 825 3252: I'm not familiar
24/11/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Sigireta, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
24/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Yes I understand
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/11/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
24/11/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
24/11/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
24/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 825 3252: No , I understand
24/11/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
24/11/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
24/11/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

07/12/23, 10:37 pm - +263 71 825 3252: Topic: what is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there? 

After the genocide , life in Rwanda was very difficult , this emanates from the fact that the economy was left in shambles since war requires heavy expendity. There was closure of industries especially the Transnational companies because investors were driven off due to the harsh conditions in the economy. People in Rwanda faced poverty , lacked basic commodities and this was due to high unemployment rates in the economy. The economy struggled to rise again since it was left in a depression and the country lost most of the energetic people who were able to help in developing the economy. Life became miserable especially to the underprivileged groups since they were left without anything to cater for their needs due to heavy losses of their way of earning a living. The country was left distructed and the need for them to work on their infrastructures left the economy with hunger. After the genocide, investors were no longer interested in investing in Rwanda because of fearing the fact that maybe it will repeat itself. Therefore, after the genocide, life in Rwanda became hard for the people in the country and led to underdevelopment of the economy.

" My Inspirational Story"

I am being inspired to a higher degree by the story of  Zimbabwean speaker of Parliament ,J. Mudenda who worked really hard to become something in life. Tracing his life history,Mr J.Mudenda , he is a man who follows his dreams no matter what circumstances. He grew up in a poor family, got educated at a government school which was cheap so that he could afford , then after finishing high school , he wasn't able to be enrolled at a university because of lack of finance. He then decided to search for a job and he was employed as a clerk and managed to save some money for advancing his career. Mr J. Mudenda lateron got enrolled at the University of Zambia and studied law , he took his first degree at the age of fifty five years. This inspires me the most since he followed his dreams of studying law. Mr J. Mudenda never gave up on his dreams and this always give me strength since I learnt that challenges in life can either enrich you or poison you but you're the one who decides. One can become whatever they may opt to be if the person works for it. He inspires me also by the fact that quitting is never an option on the road to success, though he couldn't afford to pay the fees at a younger age , he worked really hard for him to pay his fees later. Mr J .Mudenda inspires me a lot through what he went through to become the man he is right now , it was only because of hard work and fighting for what one really wants in life

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

I understand that you are occupied with work, But this is really disrespectful to me and to this scholarship opportunity itself, I have been trying to communicate with you for the past 2-3 days and there has been no response on your end even though you have read my messages.

*I personally feel there is actually something that is concerning you because of which you are not Proceeding ahead with the process, And I am still willing to assist you with a solution if you wish to continue ahead and get your child enrolled in the Edoofa Program*

Otherwise, I am not forcing the scholarship opportunity on you at all, *If you do not wish your child to proceed ahead and succeed with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity then please come forward and confirm so that I can provide a formal closure to your application!*

18/12/23, 3:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
18/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 287 8008: Wonderful whats the period between the 7days enrollment and the    yearly payment
18/12/23, 4:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please the yearly payment is done when the student will be coming to India, that is next year  for the time being you only have to focus on the Enrollment fees
