11/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Yes thats what l believe

11/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 105 2450: They are supportive,l have already told them on the family gathering last week
11/12/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Well that's good
11/12/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
11/12/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 105 2450: I promise to have 14points
11/12/23, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: That's the spirit

11/12/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
11/12/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

12/12/23, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Makanaka, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Actually,l heard that edoofa scholarships are only for abroad ,if there were also edoofa schoolarships in African universities ,l will go there
12/12/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: So isn't international education a priority for you, Makanaka?
12/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Its a priority Ms
12/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 105 2450: I forget to ask do you have universities in Africa
12/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Education abroad is more advance than in Africa ,plus its a peaceful place for education thre will be no disturbances
12/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: You see, Makanaka, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
12/12/23, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: No please, we offer scholarship only to those who wish to study in India, Makanaka.
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok l now understand it
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Education abroad is more advance than in Africa ,plus its a peaceful place for education thre will be no disturbances
12/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Noted,okay okay l now get it
12/12/23, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

15/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Makanaka.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 105 2450: No, l am not familiar
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok l get it, so how much per semester
15/12/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Makanaka, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/12/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
15/12/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: There are two semesters a year please.
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
15/12/23, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
15/12/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok
15/12/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Its great
16/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
16/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 105 2450: Morning
16/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same, Makanaka?

Do ensure active participation.
16/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 105 2450: Edooofa is great ,it really helps .Its an advantage to Africans like me
16/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 105 2450: So have you decided the day we will end this session
16/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: Today itself, Makanaka.
16/12/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: You see, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
16/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 105 2450: Yes l agreee
16/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 105 2450: Ok ok
16/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 78 105 2450: What follows,after this
16/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Makanaka?
16/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: We are in the Counseling session currently discussing the process, Makanaka?
16/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
16/12/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Yes
16/12/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok
18/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 105 2450: Hello
18/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
18/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 105 2450: Okay l get it
18/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly read and understand, Makanaka?
18/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 105 2450: So they pay high money or its little money
18/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
18/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 105 2450: Yes
18/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: Please.
18/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 105 2450: I want to ask these earning programs do they really pay high money
18/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: I hope now you have a better understanding?
18/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 105 2450: Yes l now have a better understanding
18/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Wonderful
18/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/12/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 105 2450: I am participating but you know that Zimbabwe data bundles are expensive,you have to understand that plus l am a dstudent l dont go to work
20/12/23, 9:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning Makanaka

How are you doing today?
20/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 105 2450: I ãm fine
20/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Makanaka, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Yes
20/12/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Makanaka, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/12/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 105 2450: More than 1000
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: It would be $1500-$2250
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: You see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/12/23, 6:08 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/12/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok
20/12/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 105 2450: I thiñk so
20/12/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/12/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
20/12/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/12/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok
20/12/23, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
20/12/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
20/12/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok so we have just finished step 1
20/12/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.
20/12/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Woow ,Thats great
20/12/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
20/12/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
20/12/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Thats really great
20/12/23, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
20/12/23, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
20/12/23, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: Do connect Mrs Ruth with your parents too.
20/12/23, 7:34 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Let me connect to her but now she is offline
20/12/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: That's fine please.

She would get in touch
20/12/23, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
20/12/23, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
20/12/23, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
