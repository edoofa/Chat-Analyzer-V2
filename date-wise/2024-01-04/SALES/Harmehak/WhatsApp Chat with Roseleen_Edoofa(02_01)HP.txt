02/01/24, 8:44 pm - Harmehak: Good Evening,

*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Roseleen	Graneti. 

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. 

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video to go through and learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.

03/01/24, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.* <This message was edited>
