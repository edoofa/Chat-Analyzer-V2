I am delighted to know more about everyone!
27/12/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Well Irikidzai, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
27/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 399 0267: I do believe that it is a life changing decision
27/12/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Alright please, in that case would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Irikidzai?
27/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 399 0267: It would really broaden my education in that I would be obtaining an education that is different from our country .

I can see you are looking for maximum exposure.
27/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: Irikidzai, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
27/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 399 0267: Yes my family members are aware of my plans to study abroad. And yes they are more than willing to support me mentally and financially
27/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 399 0267: Yes. I am
27/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I appreciate their support please.
27/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
27/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 399 0267: I appreciate the information. I am confident that I can do better than 2 Advanced Level passes
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: That's great, Irikidzai.
27/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you
27/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Finance ?
27/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 399 0267: I have always had an interest in finance and budgeting money because of my family background in business. And it has great graduate prospects. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: That's great,

What all did you research regarding your desired field, Irikidzai?
27/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 399 0267: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 399 0267: I did do a little research in my desired field
27/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 399 0267: <Media omitted>

27/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Received please
27/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Alright and what all did you learn please?
27/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 399 0267: I learnt that I needed to have a background in finance, Economics, or business studies. I also learnt that there are many career paths in my desired field and that each of these careers paths have different roles and require different levels of experience
27/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 399 0267: A degree in finance or economics can be a great foundation for a career in private equity. Finance degrees typically focus on topics like financial management, investment analysis, and financial markets. Economics degrees typically focus on topics like economic theory, statistics, and econometrics. Both degrees can help you develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which are essential in private equity.
27/12/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: That's great, Irikidzai. Its good to know that you have a thorough awareness of your desired field.

27/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please,

Did you have a thorough reading?
27/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 399 0267: Yes. I did. Thank you

27/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 399 0267: In the next five years, I see myself employed in one of the various departments and also attempting to pursue my studies by taking a post graduate course in chartered accounting or actuarial sciences.
27/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 399 0267: I believe that that if I get into the programme it would really help me to achieve my dreams of furthering my studies and and also help me to find the most suitable career option for me. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: That is really great Irikidzai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
27/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 399 0267: Of course Zimbabwe has an excellent education system but studying abroad offers me an opportunity that I would not get in my own country. It also allows me to travel and understand what happens in other societies. It also opens my education pallete and for international recognition. And it also pushes me to become independent in terms of money and assist my parents by alleviating some of the pressures such as school fees since they have other children <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Very well expressed, Irikidzai, it's great to know that you are open to new challenges and wish to build yourself a promising future.

27/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: That's very correct, Irikidzai!
27/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

27/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 399 0267: No we are not aware
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Alright please
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you for this information. It really helps us
27/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you for highlighting this
27/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
27/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same, Irikidzai?
27/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 399 0267: I think that it very affordable and the earn while you learn programme makes it very easy to pay the fees
27/12/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
27/12/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: Irikidzai, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
27/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 399 0267: I agree the same. It is all very true
27/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 399 0267: Cost of living and travelling in Zimbabwe is a bit expensive
27/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Irikidzai!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
27/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 399 0267: Yes I am. Thank you
27/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
27/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
27/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

27/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please
27/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you for explaining further
27/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
27/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 399 0267: This would be very helpful
27/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 399 0267: No. I have understood everything you have explained so far
27/12/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: That's great
27/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 320 1523: What exactly will these students be doing as they work and earn
27/12/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
27/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 320 1523: OK so this is done at the college
27/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 71 399 0267: That sounds wonderful opportunity
27/12/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Online please,

They would be alloted a dedicated mentor who assists them.

They are start while still in Zimbabwe itself.
27/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 71 399 0267: This is intresting
27/12/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 320 1523: Oh yes I do
27/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Yes
27/12/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
27/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Yes
27/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Irikidzai, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
27/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 399 0267: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 399 0267: $1500-$2250
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
27/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Okay that's interesting
27/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: You see Irikidzai, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 399 0267: I agree
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Okay understood
27/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
27/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
27/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
27/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
27/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Yes I understand
27/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
27/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Okay
27/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Understood
27/12/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
27/12/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

27/12/23, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Ennie, do connect with Mrs Ruth yourself as well, you can have a direct call too!

@263773201523
27/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you very much
27/12/23, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything, Irikidzai?
27/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 399 0267: So I can only proceed to step 2 after I get the Reservation letter?
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please,

Can you rephrase your question for me?
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Okay
27/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 399 0267: So I have to wait for a Reservation letter to proceed to the next phase?
27/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Which reservation letter are you referring to please?
27/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: You mean the acceptance letter?
27/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Yes. Forgive the mistake
27/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
27/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 399 0267: I meant the acceptance letter
27/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: You receive your Acceptance letter at Stage 3, after/if you qualify for the interview at Stage 2 please.
27/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: And your enrollment is done only after you receive the acceptance letter.
27/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Okay. I have understood thank you
27/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Irikidzai.
27/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you
27/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
27/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Irikidzai_Edoofa(26/12)HP" to "Irikidzai_Edoofa(26/12)HP 2025"
27/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you so much
27/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: So now do you have any queries, Irikidzai?
27/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 399 0267: No you have explained quite well. Thank you
27/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
27/12/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
27/12/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

28/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 399 0267: On one hand it is true that Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. We start by taking into consideration the fact fact that many farms in Africa are small and subsistence-based. Such farms have not had the resources and opportunities to grow and mordenize. This means that farmers are stuck in a cycle of low productivity and low income. This is turn makes it hard to invest in new technologies and techniques that improve their yields. There are many factors that lead to this kind of stagnation. These factors include lack of access to credit, lack of infrastructure like roads and irrigation systems, as well as limited information and education. If we move on to address the issue of inefficient farms, we realise that even when farms do not have the resources to mordenize and expand, they may not be using the most sufficient methods. A great example is the farms that use traditional farming methods that are not optimized for sustainability . Some farms are not able to get their produce to the market due to lack of transportation or storage facilities. All this leads to inefficient farming practices and ultimately poor diets. However, it is not accurate to say that this is solely due to inefficient farming methods. Other factors come into play such as urbanization. More and more people have become dependent on food that is imported from rural areas as increasing numbers of people have moved to the city. This leads to price hikes and food shortages, especially in times of crisis. Another factor is conflict. Violence and unrest disrupts transportation, it least to a shortage of food or results in the food becoming too expensive for the average African to afford. To add on, some regions in Africa are simply not suitable for growing crops fur to climate or geography. In some places the climate is such that periodic floods and droughts see experienced in alternate fashion. These two natural disasters result in extreme door shortages due to poor harvest. There are many different factors that contribute to poor diets in Africa and although stagnant and inefficient farms is one of the major reasons, it would be innacurate to claim them as the sole factor of poor diets. There are many other factors that contribute to poor diets. Therefore it is true that Africans have poor diets because of stagnant farms and inefficient methods to a lesser extent

28/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 399 0267: A memory that once would have sent shivers down my spine and brought tears to my eyes, is now a memory that I look back at with ease. I had not realised back then that one moment would forever be my turning point. Not only had I managed to change my life but I had also managed to changed the life of my friend, Charmaine. Charmaine had always been a positive person who preferred to look at life with optimism until she suddenly changed. I never really understood how one human being could suddenly despise the very thought of waking up the next morning. She began to express her dislike of life in general and it always left me with questions. Questions that I never asked her in fear of her reaction. I acted blind to her negativity and tried as best as I could to spread more positivity in her life. She however, would have none of it and would only accept gifts that were in the color black. "it's the color of my soul, " she would always say. Charmaine and I were complete opposites now, where she was dark, gloomy and moody, I was lively, bubbly and vibrant. With time, her negativity began to wear me down. I began pondering whether I should confront her or leave her alone for good. Eventually I decided it were best if I confronted her and the result of out conversation would leave me with a clear cut answer on how to proceed. With an air of determination I walked over to her house as she did not live far away. My resolve was firm and as I entered the house I went straight to her room since her parents were rarely home. As I reached her room I decided to knock but quickly decided against it as I needed the element of suprise. I pushed her door open and was startled with the sight in front of me. I felt like the wind had been knocked out of me. Caught off guard, she just stared at me with the knife hanging in mid air. I realised that her left wrist was already bleeding and I rushed and took the knife away from her. I threw it the other side of the room. She broke down almost instantly and I held her as she poured her heart out to me. I worked quickly to stop the bleeding and called her parents who rushed home as soon as they heard what had happened. After a few weeks I saw her again and she looked happier. She look at peace and livelier than the last time I had seen her and that is when I realised that her behavioral change had been a cry for help. I learnt the top always notice people's changes in behavior and always check to make sure people were okay.

29/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Alright please
29/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
29/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
29/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

29/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 71 399 0267: Let me check
29/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 320 1523: Interesting
29/12/23, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 4th or 5th January 2023 for $200 and the  4th or 5th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 4th or 5th January 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same? <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 320 1523: We are already past the 4th of Dec. I am a bit confused
29/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: Kindly excuse me please
29/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: I hope now you have a better clarity?
29/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 320 1523: This message was deleted
29/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 320 1523: OK I see now.
29/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 320 1523: I may have a problem with early January since that is when we are paying school fees for Irikidzai and her siblings. Is it possible to do it around the 17th when I get my next payment
29/12/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Let me discuss the same with board please, Irikidzai
29/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 320 1523: Thank you
29/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
29/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Good afternoon Mrs Ennie
29/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I did discuss about Irikidzai's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. 

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Irikidzai's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
29/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 320 1523: This will work out well for us. Thank you so much
29/12/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please,

03/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 71 399 0267: Good morning. Yes we may continue
03/01/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: I hope you were thoroughly able to go through your Acceptance Letter, Irikidzai?
03/01/24, 10:00 am - +263 71 399 0267: I read through most of it
03/01/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: That's great,

So far, do you have any queries for me?
03/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 71 399 0267: No so far it is all clear
03/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 77 320 1523: Morning morning. No queries for noe
03/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

In that case, shall I brief you about the payment modes?
03/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 77 320 1523: Ok
03/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
03/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC
