03/01/24, 12:00 am - +263 71 681 1517: Ohhh let me talk to them ma'am sorry for that
03/01/24, 12:04 am - +263 71 681 1517: Ma'am what are the required points for one to get an Edoofa Scholarship
03/01/24, 9:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 71 681 1517: Yes ma'am
03/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 71 681 1517: I think I am ma'am
03/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted
03/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Well Oliver now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
03/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 681 1517: Yes ma'am
03/01/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright, and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
03/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 71 681 1517: Being honest ma'am l always wanted to travel around the world ma'am and l would confidently say l am prepared
03/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Oliver, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
03/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 71 681 1517: Oky ma'am l will now
03/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 71 682 3514: Hie there.  My name is Onias Chimhenga.  I am Oliver's father. I support him in getting education abroad
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: Hello Mr Oliver.

Duly noted please,

As parents to Oliver, may I know what is your financial planning for his higher education?
03/01/24, 2:49 pm - +263 71 682 3514: We intend to save from our small sales so that we are able to fund his studies
03/01/24, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.

May I know more about your business please?
03/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 71 682 3514: We run a small shop whereby we buy wholesale and sell retail. Goods we sell vary from groceries to clothes.
03/01/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Oh Alright please!

Duly noted, Mr Oliver.
03/01/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: I believe you must recall the costs discussed earlier?
03/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 71 682 3514: Thanks very much.  Actually its Mr Onias
03/01/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Excuse me for the same Mr Oliver.
03/01/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware of the costs please?
03/01/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 682 3514: Am quite aware
03/01/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/01/24, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
