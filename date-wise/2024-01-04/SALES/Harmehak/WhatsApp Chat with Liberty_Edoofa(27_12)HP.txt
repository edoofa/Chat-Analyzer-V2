You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

29/12/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
3. Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you?
02/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 78 697 8729: 1. Edoofa is an Educational program which forcuses on quality higher education.Edoofa Scholarship Program is an well known appriciated in SAARC nations and in Africa offering 50-100% scholarships on tution fees.Edoofa have worked with 250 universities and colleges in India.Edoofa can help you if u want to study in other countries like Canada or Germeny .Edoofa assist students with VISA application processes.Edoofa did not offer a full Scholarship but after help of scholarship fund the fees come down to $ 2000/$3000.

2.Edoofa did not offer a full Scolarship no matter your passes or poor you are.
They just reduce the fees after their Sclolarship fund to $2000/$3000 per year.
 3.My family members are willing to support
02/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly followed the document, Liberty.
02/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Did you discuss the same with your parents too?
02/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 78 697 8729: I am so grateful
02/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i did and they appreciated
02/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Liberty.
02/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: I believe you do understand the following, Liberty.
02/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i do but there are few things i don't understand
02/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 78 697 8729: This message was deleted
02/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 697 8729: Is Edoofa going to pay my fare
02/01/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
02/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 697 8729: Who is going to buy my plane ticket
02/01/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$450, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations
02/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 697 8729: Ok Ms Harmehak thank you and now i understand
02/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

Is there any thing else that you would like to ask?
02/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 697 8729: Yes, The actual fee after scholarship fund is not known?
02/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 78 697 8729: Can i study Law with 9 A levels ?
02/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: The fee is between $2000-3000 itself.

However the final fee is shared by the university when you will receive acceptance letter.
02/01/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 697 8729: Ok and it will be payed annually or per semester
02/01/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Now you see Liberty, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
02/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 78 697 8729: Okay okay yah so it is affordable
02/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Who would be the one supporting you financially and what profession they are in?
02/01/24, 11:51 am - +263 78 697 8729: My parents are farmers and my sister do teaching
02/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
02/01/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: Earlier you shared with me the financial challenges, I hope everything is clear now and you thoroughly discussed the finances with your family?
02/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 78 697 8729: With 9 points can i study Law
02/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Yes please

02/01/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
02/01/24, 9:08 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Financial constraints , my parents couldn’t afford since they are peasants farmers and they have other responsibilities
03/01/24, 9:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/01/24, 9:23 am - +263 78 697 8729: Good morning how are you?
Yes we can
03/01/24, 9:26 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please
03/01/24, 9:26 am - Harmehak: I can understand,

So what is their financial planning to support you now, Liberty?
03/01/24, 9:29 am - +263 78 697 8729: They are going to take a loan
03/01/24, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Alright please
03/01/24, 9:31 am - +263 78 697 8729: Can i ask
03/01/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Yes please?
03/01/24, 9:32 am - +263 78 697 8729: Why Edoofa did not give a full Scholarship?
03/01/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a full scholarship please?
03/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 78 697 8729: Is it not about paying all the fees
03/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
03/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: I hope you must have read in the document regarding the same as well?
03/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 697 8729: Ok thank you and i was confusing those two things
03/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: I understand,

I hope you now have a better clarity?
03/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 78 697 8729: Yes please
03/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: So far would you like to ask anything?
03/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 78 697 8729: Yes about Law

03/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through the shared resources and find the information helpful, Liberty?
03/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i did
03/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Liberty 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
03/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 697 8729: I am not yet familiar about the costs as well as my family members  and I thought if im assured of the scholarship then will look for the possible university or maybe Edoofa has specific university in which they offer these scholarships
03/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
03/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
03/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
03/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok noted and thank you
03/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Liberty, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
03/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 78 697 8729: It is affordable
03/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to read you can score a 100% scholarship too?
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Yes but how can i be able to get it?
03/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
03/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok can you elaborate on number 2 ,3,5 and 6 i did  not get it clear
03/01/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: It's all related to your academics and performance during the evaluation of the Counseling session along with test and interview for the scholarship, Liberty. <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok  ok now i get it
03/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
03/01/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation
03/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 697 8729: I want to know the time to pay the enrollment fee so that i will be alert
03/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok Ms Harmehak thank you
03/01/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: I would guide you later in the discussion.
03/01/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Liberty, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
03/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Yes it is true
03/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Liberty?
03/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 697 8729: I can see that Edoofa is making high and quality education affordable for us as students
03/01/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
03/01/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
03/01/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/01/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

03/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok i understand but i have some questions
03/01/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Is this EWYL program helps students who are doind Law
03/01/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, it's a program for all Edoofians.

You participate in the program while you are still in Zimbabwe and continue for your entire course duration.
03/01/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok Ms Harmehak and now i can see that if you are serious education with Edoofa is affordable
03/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
03/01/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/01/24, 2:26 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i can see it and this means even the poor family can afford Quality education through Edoofa
03/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
03/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 697 8729: My battery is low but i am ready
03/01/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: Liberty, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
03/01/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/01/24, 2:35 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Around $25 000
03/01/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: It would be $1500-$2250
03/01/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: You see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/01/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/01/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: You see, Liberty, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
03/01/24, 2:40 pm - +263 78 697 8729: I think so
03/01/24, 2:45 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Now i can see how best Edoofa is
03/01/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
03/01/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/01/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok i understand and i need to ask
03/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
03/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
03/01/24, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/01/24, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
03/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok sorry i was about to ask about the cycle
03/01/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i understand
03/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 697 8729: If i surpass stage 2 it means i am accepted?
03/01/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
03/01/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Liberty
03/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok so is it difficult ? hence u said there are many applicants and of which 2500 students are needed
03/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Well if you perform honesty and follow all the guidelines, I shall surely assist you thoroughly.
03/01/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
03/01/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
03/01/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

It remains the same the entire course.
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok
03/01/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: This is the registration fee which is not a separate fee for our Proud Edoofians, Liberty.

It's waived off from your tuition fee itself.
03/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 78 697 8729: Ok i understand Ms Harmehak
03/01/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

03/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
03/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “04-01-24” at 10:30 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
