02/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 289 2775: Admission Process
1. In the first step, the students have to 
receive proper information about the 
Edoofa program so that they understand 
the unique benefits and the value what we 
are doing for them. (This step happens 
when students are in Africa and can 
happen on either call, WhatsApp, email or 
any other online medium.)
2. In the second step, Edoofa eligibility 
check is done and interview is taken. (This
also happens while the students are in 
Africa.) Once the students are found 
eligible by evaluating their 
transcripts/grades and performance in the 
interview, they are offered the chance of 
enrolment in the Edoofa program
3. The third step is the Acceptance Letter from Edoofa, in this step if you manage to clear the 
Interview Process, then you get selected into our Program and get an Acceptance Letter from 
Edoofa
4. The fourth Step involves finalizing your enrolment into the Edoofa Program by completing 
our Edoofa Enrolment Fee formalities (fee ranges from $350-$750 depending upon the 
admission cycle): Once the student pays the registration fee, Edoofa helps in generating the 
Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) from the University/college as well as the visa letter 
which Edoofa also helps in mailing to the Indian High Commission in the particular country 
for the purpose of Visa. All the necessary help and information regarding the Visa process 
will be provided by the Edoofa Admission officers at the stage .
5.In the Fifth Step, once the enrolment is completed, our students rely on the full-fledged 
support provided by our admission officers. No other college or programme has this level of 
conviction towards comforting the students and providing a wonderful experience to them. 
To get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students 
remain in their home country and they are directly going to be connecting with University 
representatives.). Once the university sessions are over, students secure the Admission 
offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation and 
then the student is expected to pay Registration fees (ranging from $500-$750) to confirm 
their admission with in a stipulated time frame.
6. In the Sixth Step, once the student pays the registration fee, Edoofa helps in generating the 
Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) from the University/college as well as the visa letter. 
Edoofa also guides in the mailing process to the Indian High Commission in the particular 
country for the purpose of Visa. All the necessary help and information regarding the Visa 
process will be provided by the Edoofa Admission officers at this stage.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 
*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*
 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
