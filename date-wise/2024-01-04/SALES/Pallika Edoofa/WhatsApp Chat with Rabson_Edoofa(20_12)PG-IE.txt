02/01/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Rabson?
02/01/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Rabson, I would like to know that if you were interested in Healthcare, so why haven't you opted for Biology, physics and Chemistry in your A level.
02/01/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
