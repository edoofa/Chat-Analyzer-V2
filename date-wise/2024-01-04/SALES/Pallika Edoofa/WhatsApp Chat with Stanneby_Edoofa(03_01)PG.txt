Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
03/01/24, 7:29 pm - +263 77 404 3070: I am Zviito Kanengoni, the mother of Stanneby Maunga. For living, l am a self employed(vendor). I finished O level and did not proceed due to lack of financial support. So as a parent, l did not want my son to end at a level l ended. What motivate me to support my son ahead for education is that l wants him to be independent and a critical thinker. As nowadays education is the key to success if he is educated he can start his own things
03/01/24, 7:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this.
