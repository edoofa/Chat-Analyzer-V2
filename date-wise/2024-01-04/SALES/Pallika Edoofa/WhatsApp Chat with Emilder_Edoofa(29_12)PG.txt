What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? You can get a 100% scholarship with Edoofa program but it does not cover all costs from transport to flight. There's an earn as you learn program that helps you get funds to pay for your fees and credits. This sponsorship program is based in India. For help I can contact Miss Jasmine or Miss Saloni.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? I am a young, ambitious woman and full of potential. My passion is deeply grounded within the law sector and in the need to make the world a better place through finding justice for those that were wronged and make their life easier.

29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

29/12/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 289 6783: I believe I did as fairly well as I could in my Advanced Level final examinations. I will forward the results as soon as they are out in a few weeks.
29/12/23, 1:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
29/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 289 6783: I haven't applied to any University abroad yet.

29/12/23, 3:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay as I was having my lunch
29/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 289 6783: No problem at all ma'am.
29/12/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know why the grades are low?
29/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 289 6783: It had been a tough term for me, I was absent from school for a number of days because I had not been feeling well. This caused me to be behind with some of my schoolwork and be behind with my lessons. I also had not grasped the correct concept of answering the questions especially in Geography.
29/12/23, 3:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand!!
29/12/23, 3:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

02/01/24, 9:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
02/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 78 289 6783: Interesting and motivating indeed!
02/01/24, 9:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Emilder, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
02/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 78 289 6783: Looking at the successes of Indian origin men and women, I'm more certain that attaining an education in India will surely boost my chances of having an amazing career and more experience and skills than studying anywhere else. Not only looking at the successes that these men and women have, they also have over 9 digit incomes and that would be a dream come true if I could be able to join the Forbes list just like them.
02/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 78 289 6783: I did a bit of research and I found out that the tuition fees for international students ranges from $3000 to $6000 annually, is that correct?
02/01/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely! Emilder, India has produced remarkable talents, and pursuing education there can indeed offer valuable experiences and skills. The success stories of Indian origin individuals, with their impressive incomes, serve as inspiring benchmarks
02/01/24, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/01/24, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
02/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 289 6783: I do feel so, it will be more affordable with the help of the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program.
02/01/24, 10:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!
02/01/24, 10:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.
02/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 78 289 6783: That really gives students a chance to have a great education abroad with less worries of unaffordable living and learning expenses.
02/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Exactly, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
02/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
02/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
02/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
02/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
02/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
02/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 289 6783: Definitely!
02/01/24, 10:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
02/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 78 289 6783: No I don't.
02/01/24, 10:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
02/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 78 289 6783: Does this mean I can even earn credits that will cover the whole annual fee?
02/01/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!
02/01/24, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
02/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 289 6783: I really like the 4th point because that takes a huge load off my shoulders because of the help throughout university, that is very good.
02/01/24, 10:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

02/01/24, 10:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
02/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 289 6783: My father will be helping with the remaining fee.
02/01/24, 10:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
02/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 78 289 6783: They are very supportive and they want this for me as badly as I want it too. Despite my sisters having to pay for their masters degrees that they are both currently pursuing, they are also willing to help wherever they can.
02/01/24, 10:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Emilder, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
02/01/24, 10:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
02/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 289 6783: Very true, that's exactly what I am hoping for
02/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 289 6783: That is correct
02/01/24, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
02/01/24, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
02/01/24, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
02/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 289 6783: So does this mean if I pay the 350, I can apply to any Universities in India with the help of Edoofa, with a higher chance of being selected?
02/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 289 6783: Yes please!
02/01/24, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Emilder, Please note that we will be guiding you for the same!
02/01/24, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid.
02/01/24, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/01/24, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/01/24, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
02/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 289 6783: Ooh I understand clearly now
02/01/24, 11:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
02/01/24, 11:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 78 289 6783: I think we have done stage one we are going to stage 2, is that right?
02/01/24, 11:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
02/01/24, 11:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
02/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 78 289 6783: Yes ma'am!
02/01/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
02/01/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
02/01/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
02/01/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 289 6783: I understand very well!
02/01/24, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

03/01/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Emilder,
I hope you are doing well
03/01/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
03/01/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
03/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 78 289 6783: I am ma'am, how are you doing today?
03/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 78 289 6783: Yes I did.
03/01/24, 10:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
03/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 78 289 6783: We discussed how the program really is a great opportunity for me to go abroad for university and how it can help with the financial strain of paying the annual tuition fees especially since my family's salaries does not come in USD. If I do get the scholarship, everyone including my sisters are willing to lend a hand in paying the amount that will be left after I get credit scores of the semester. The whole family is very proud for the step I am taking and we are all praying it really works out. They are happy with the program and what they read in the Frequently Asked Questions pdf you sent to me yesterday. Learning in a different country can be hard if you are alone with no help whatsoever so the help that Edoofa offers its scholarship students throughout university from applying up until graduation is really great, they were really impressed by that.
03/01/24, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Emilder, I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career. May I know if your family has any queries, please
03/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 289 6783: No, not yet they don't. Their questions were answered by the FAQ pdf.
03/01/24, 10:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
03/01/24, 10:56 am - +263 78 289 6783: They think it's quite a reasonable amount especially in comparison with the enrollment fees for universities *without* Edoofa's help. They think it is more affordable and easier done.
03/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 78 289 6783: We all do.
03/01/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career, Emilder.
03/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 364 2468: Very well, thanks, and how are you?

students are assigned live online projects during which they gain valuable
