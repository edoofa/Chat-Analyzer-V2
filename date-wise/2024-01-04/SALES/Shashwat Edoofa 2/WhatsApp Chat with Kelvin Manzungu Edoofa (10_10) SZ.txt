25/10/23, 7:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good morning to all! I trust you're having a splendid day. Unfortunately, due to a technical issue with my device, I have switched to a new number. I would greatly appreciate it if you could save my new contact information +91 83509 76168. Your co-operation is highly appreciated!
25/10/23, 7:43 am - +263 71 492 5319: Yes I have saved it. We can proceed with our discussion
25/10/23, 7:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Roneward!
25/10/23, 7:44 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
25/10/23, 7:44 am - +263 71 492 5319: Yes it's so great
25/10/23, 7:47 am - +263 71 492 5319: Yes those are the requirements which are needed for one to apply for a university place abroad and also that's what the laws of the country states.the recommendation will put trust in university he will be applying to.Also it will increase the amount of scholarship percentage.
25/10/23, 7:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
25/10/23, 7:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
25/10/23, 7:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 7:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
25/10/23, 7:58 am - +263 77 376 1475: Noted sir
25/10/23, 8:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
25/10/23, 8:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
25/10/23, 8:08 am - +263 77 376 1475: Thanks for the advice on how we can pay for the admission fee
25/10/23, 8:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It will be my utmost pleasure to assist you with the process, Mr. Roneward! So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
25/10/23, 8:24 am - +263 77 376 1475: I would like to first of all thank you the discussion
I have learnt that the fees affordable and there is less barden to the parents as the student will fund himself through EWYL programs
25/10/23, 8:25 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
25/10/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 492 5319: Thanks I have understand now your explanation on what Edoofa do to help my child attain his education
25/10/23, 8:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 492 5319: I think we have discussed phase 1 and 2.we  are going to stage 3
25/10/23, 8:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
25/10/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 492 5319: Yes sir go ahead
25/10/23, 9:03 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
25/10/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 492 5319: Yes sir
25/10/23, 9:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

26/10/23, 11:18 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Mr.Shashwat* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
26/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 393 9614: Yes
26/10/23, 11:26 am - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Mr. Shashwat go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by him during the session?
26/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 707 4506: Yes
26/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 707 4506: Yes
26/10/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 707 4506: My session with Mr Shashwat went well and all of my questions were effectively addressed
26/10/23, 11:57 am - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
26/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 707 4506: Yes we did and she say that Edoofa is the best program which you need to trust
26/10/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 707 4506: And she told us if it was not for Edoofa she would have not manage to send her daughters to study abroad
26/10/23, 12:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
26/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 707 4506: Yes that is true

26/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 707 4506: So can I ask something
26/10/23, 12:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Yes please
26/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 707 4506: Do you fund transport for students to move from there countries to India ?
And is the program the one that will be taking responsibilities of the student like making sure that the student is safe from things like bullieng
26/10/23, 1:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Before I can answer this please answer my question if your child studies at University of Zimbabwe will University pay for the transportation?
26/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 707 4506: No
26/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 707 4506: So can we proceed with our discussion Sir because I have a lesson at 14:30pm
26/10/23, 1:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay please inform me once you back .
26/10/23, 1:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: And how much will bus or Van charge you per day ?
26/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 707 4506: OK sir
26/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 707 4506: They will charge me 1us
26/10/23, 1:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Where do you live ?
26/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 707 4506: I live in Harare

26/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 707 4506: Yes sir
26/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 707 4506: But it might actually cost you  $4 per day
27/10/23, 8:36 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
27/10/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 376 1475: Morning sir kelvin today is having an exam so he will late you know once he finished
27/10/23, 10:12 am - Sahil Edoofa: Wishing Kelvin all the best
27/10/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 393 9614: We receive sir
27/10/23, 10:19 am - Sahil Edoofa: How much is that annually?
27/10/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 393 9614: Annually it may cost atmost  usd 720
We are saying 20usd per week then per month 80usd then per year 720 because we are removing 3 months holidays
27/10/23, 11:07 am - Sahil Edoofa: That way more than what you spend for international flight
27/10/23, 11:07 am - Sahil Edoofa: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $400-$590, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations
27/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 376 1475: Thanks for that information .I now know better.

30/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 492 5319: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 3:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
30/10/23, 3:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
30/10/23, 3:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 3:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
30/10/23, 3:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 3:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 5th or 6th November 2023 for $200 and the 5th or 6th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 5th or 6th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
30/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 492 5319: I will opt for the first one

Noted with thanks
06/11/23, 11:51 am - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
06/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 707 4506: Yes
06/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 492 5319: Yes sir
06/11/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 707 4506: Sir did you send the later to that email I gave you
06/11/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 393 9614: Letter

06/11/23, 12:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Will send it by day end.
06/11/23, 12:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me guide you
06/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 707 4506: OK sir
06/11/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
06/11/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
