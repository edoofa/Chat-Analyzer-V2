29/12/23, 8:35 AM - +263 71 438 9968: My parents are also in the group,Mr and Mrs Muchada. My mother is a secretary and my father is self employed.
29/12/23, 8:40 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, Tadiwa. It's great to know that your parents, Mr. and Mrs. Muchada, are also part of the group. It seems like you come from a diverse background with your mother working as a secretary and your father being self-employed. I extend a warm welcome to them for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey.
29/12/23, 8:41 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you so much.
29/12/23, 8:48 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
29/12/23, 8:52 AM - +263 71 438 9968: My long term goals include
Getting a degree in pharmacy, building my own pharmacy, improving my communication skills,getting good grades in all my studies, develop a positive mindset.
The EWYL program will help me achieve these goals by reducing the amount of costs and tuition fee that i have to pay
29/12/23, 8:56 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It's fantastic to hear about your long-term goals, Tadiwa! Pursuing a degree in pharmacy, establishing your own pharmacy, improving communication skills, maintaining excellent grades, and developing a positive mindset are admirable objectives.🎯 The EWYL program will surely help you achieve these goals, particularly by reducing the financial burden associated with tuition fees and costs. This support can undoubtedly pave the way for your academic and professional aspirations. ✨
29/12/23, 8:57 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss. Thank you
29/12/23, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/12/23, 9:00 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Please enlighten me
29/12/23, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/12/23, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/12/23, 9:04 AM - +263 71 438 9968: I understand.
29/12/23, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/12/23, 9:08 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you. Nice to meet you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
29/12/23, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed! They are also honored to have you.
29/12/23, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/12/23, 9:18 AM - +263 71 438 9968: Yess indeed. Noted
29/12/23, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

29/12/23, 9:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now we are concluding our session!
As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

2/1/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 438 9968: 3. Through the newsletter
2/1/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 438 9968: 4. The hall of inspiration is a section in the newsletter where edoofians get to share their different experiences that shaped them or motivated them to become better people. It also helps other students to learn from their fellow colleagues and they also become motivated
2/1/24, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: This is amazing!✨
