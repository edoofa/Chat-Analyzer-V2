3/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now that the time is over, we are wrapping up our scheduled session. Kindly excuse for we could not have a continued session due to network issues at my end. 

On a brighter note, I'm excited to share that we'll soon have the opportunity to meet in person at our annual conclave during the upcoming Industrial Visit. It promises to be an enriching experience where we can connect face-to-face, network, and delve deeper into our shared interests.

In the meantime, please look out for this week's Wednesday Lesson, which I'll be sharing shortly. It's another opportunity for us to continue our learning journey together.
