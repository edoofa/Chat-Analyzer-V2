After going through the first Wednesday lesson for 2024, would like to say was a great one for a start.

In the pdf you sent above  I got to be enlightened more about the value that comes with participating in students events, seminar and workshops. Let me just brief it down;


Participating in workshops, seminars, and student activities provides a holistic learning experience, it also comes with  fostering skills beyond the academic realm therefore exposure comes into play. It cultivates networking, teamwork, and practical application of knowledge, enhancing overall personal and professional development.
