I hope you are doing well

As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.
26/12/23, 8:38 AM - +263 77 955 1065: My Christmas was very fine. We visited my grandmother at Mberengwa here in Zimbabwe. We had so much funny😁

How was your Christmas?
26/12/23, 8:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you had a delightful Christmas visiting your grandmother in Mberengwa! Family gatherings are always special. As for me, I too had a great time at our family lunch where all of us gathered. How did you find spending time with your family during the festive season? Is there anything specific you'd like to share or discuss? 😊🎄
26/12/23, 8:55 AM - +263 77 955 1065: My grandmother works at Msume high school here in Mberengwa so yesterday we went to her working place to do some cleanings.  There is a distance  from her house to the working place. We then returned home , bathed and cooked food. Food is my thing😅😅.This Christmas was very different  because there was no fruits to eat such as mangoes. This was due to climate change which caused the temperatures to be high and no rainfall. Believe me, l was very bored 😩because l like mangoes.
26/12/23, 8:56 AM - Sharda Edoofa: It's wonderful that you spent time with your grandmother and contributed to the community by helping with cleanings at Msume High School. It's also understandable how the absence of fruits, like mangoes, due to climate change could affect the usual Christmas experience. Changes in climate can indeed have various impacts on the environment and traditions. Despite the differences, it's clear that your focus on family, helping out, and enjoying good food made the day special in its own way.
26/12/23, 8:58 AM - +263 77 955 1065: Yes😅
26/12/23, 8:58 AM - +263 77 955 1065: I like eating

*🌌 "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning." - Albert Einstein 🌟*

As we delve into Einstein's insightful words, we're reminded of the dynamic journey of learning and growth. "Learn from yesterday" encourages reflection on past experiences, "live for today" emphasizes the present moment, and "hope for tomorrow" instills a forward-looking mindset.

In the context of your academic pursuit, this quote beckons you to embrace the continuous cycle of learning, applying knowledge in the present, and fostering hope for the future. Each question you pose becomes a stepping stone to new discoveries and personal development.

So, how are you doing today? 🌈 I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session.

There is a great opportunity to connect with technological driven and digital companies.

28/12/23, 9:25 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-*

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.

28/12/23, 9:58 AM - +263 77 955 1065: This project will also encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and share them openly, generally it's all about critical thinking.
28/12/23, 9:58 AM - +263 77 955 1065: We boarded another bus offwhich there is music which is loud and this is hard for me to hear everything which is being explained on the audio.

28/12/23, 10:02 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project. Are you ready?

28/12/23, 10:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
28/12/23, 10:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 10:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
28/12/23, 10:48 AM - +263 77 955 1065: Oky
28/12/23, 10:53 AM - +263 77 955 1065: This message was deleted
28/12/23, 11:00 AM - +263 77 955 1065: This message was deleted
28/12/23, 11:01 AM - +263 77 955 1065: Firstly l will have to create a whatsapp group then identity the right students who can be part of our group.The goal is to reach out for more students and provide them with important information about Edoofa before the counseling section.  For this to be simple, l will have to get in touch with my school mates.
The main reason of creating a group and provide the link for my group is to reach out to more audience using less energy and also saving time. I will be sharing the information about the exciting opportunity to pursue education in India . I will then add you as the mentor so as to provide guidance and skills, this will help because you will be ensuring that the right information is spared amongst students
28/12/23, 11:02 AM - Sharda Edoofa: - Well Done Pride, I am impressed with your understanding.
28/12/23, 11:02 AM - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
28/12/23, 11:02 AM - +263 77 955 1065: Oky noted
28/12/23, 11:03 AM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
28/12/23, 11:03 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

I can start with my school then connect with the principal of my school and tell him or her why l joined Edoofa in the first place.

I will first her why l joined Edoofa and how l am planning my future then share the program with her.

Masvingo
2/1/24, 9:05 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
2/1/24, 9:06 AM - +263 77 955 1065: I agree
2/1/24, 9:06 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
2/1/24, 9:06 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
2/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 77 955 1065: Yes
2/1/24, 9:08 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Pride, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
2/1/24, 9:09 AM - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will help you out.

2/1/24, 9:21 AM - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
2/1/24, 9:21 AM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
2/1/24, 9:22 AM - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

2/1/24, 9:40 AM - Sharda Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project, Except the fact that Project one is still on Hold. 
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.
Moreover, it is important that you make steady progress every day.

2/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
