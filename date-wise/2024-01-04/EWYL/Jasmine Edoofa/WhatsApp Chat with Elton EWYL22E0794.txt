Considering you joined the Edoofa Scholarship program with the dream of pursuing higher education, I'm genuinely curious about your plans now, especially given the missed sessions. Your dreams really matter, and I'd love to understand how I can best support you in achieving them.
I am really looking forward to hearing from you ☺️

Thank you for your concern. Unfortunately Elton is showing little interest in studying abroad and as his parents we can only guide him but can't force him. Thank you once again
