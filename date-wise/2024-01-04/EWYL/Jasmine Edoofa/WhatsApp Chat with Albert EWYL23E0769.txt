Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society?

3/1/24, 1:39 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon*
I hope you are doing well. Let us start our session with a fun question

If your pet could suddenly talk for one day, what do you think they would say or ask you?
3/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine..
I guess it may start by asking my name 😃😃😃
3/1/24, 2:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It's true, the foundation of a wonderful pet-owner relationship might just begin with a simple question, like asking your name. <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 2:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
3/1/24, 2:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 585 4209: okey
3/1/24, 2:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio, Albert?
3/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Yes I'm done
3/1/24, 2:26 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
3/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Briefly, its about learning more about the industry which I'm going to enter after the studies as well as connecting with some of the subordinates like human and resource managers ,
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Albert. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
3/1/24, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 3:05 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you today. 

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

*Now, I will meet you on Friday from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm.*
3/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Okey well noted .
3/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 78 585 4209: I'm will go through it and submit my understanding before the session on friday as you said
3/1/24, 3:22 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That would be great
