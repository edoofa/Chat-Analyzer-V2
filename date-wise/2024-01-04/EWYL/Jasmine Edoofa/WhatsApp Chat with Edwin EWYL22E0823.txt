28/12/23, 1:06 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Edwin,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, *I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity because you have not acknowledged my previous messages*
28/12/23, 1:07 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
28/12/23, 1:11 PM - +260 97 2378942: I’m so  sorry, I didn’t see the messages so I didn’t know that you sent a message before this. The grant is very significant to me and there are no misunderstandings.
28/12/23, 3:26 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you for your message.
I am happy to know this, Edwin
28/12/23, 3:50 PM - +260 97 2378942: Thank you for bringing it up
28/12/23, 3:51 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It's my pleasure

As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I really wanted to send my warmest wishes your way. _May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness_ 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* 

*Now we will connect on Saturday i.e 6-Jan-2024 for an amazing session so make sure that you don't miss it*
29/12/23, 1:24 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Dear, The Race to become eligible for a grant is still not over, Keep working hard and I look forward to hearing wonderful updates on January 6☺️

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact ✨
