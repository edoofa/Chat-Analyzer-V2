28/12/23, 1:27 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am so happy to see that you have come for the session on time today
28/12/23, 1:28 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Noted.
28/12/23, 1:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, are you done Tashinga?
28/12/23, 1:32 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I've just left a comment on Instagram
28/12/23, 1:35 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Last time we were discussing Project 3
Do you remember?
28/12/23, 1:36 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I do remember
28/12/23, 1:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
28/12/23, 1:37 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I do agree
28/12/23, 1:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
28/12/23, 1:41 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Duly noted
28/12/23, 1:46 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
28/12/23, 1:46 PM - +27 73 743 6250: I agree
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
28/12/23, 1:52 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I am ready.
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - +27 73 743 6250: It seems fair enjoyable to be able to connect with my School head
28/12/23, 1:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
28/12/23, 2:00 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Noted
28/12/23, 2:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Tashinga, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
28/12/23, 2:06 PM - +27 73 743 6250: I'll definitely do so ,sorry for the inconvenience Ms Jasmine.
28/12/23, 2:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will help you out.
28/12/23, 2:10 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Okay, how soon should this project be done ?
28/12/23, 2:13 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All. EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations.

28/12/23, 2:16 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Understood.
28/12/23, 2:18 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Additionally, EDOOFA's Earn While You Learn Program helps students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation by providing opportunities to learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
28/12/23, 2:19 PM - +27 73 743 6250: So I basically inform the headmaster about Edoofa.
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: In Zimbabwe alone, EDOOFA has enrolled more than 1,500 students in the program within the last year. Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - +27 73 743 6250: This will definitely entice the headmaster
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(Ph.D.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
28/12/23, 2:30 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Duly noted
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you go through all the information, and see that this can be a million opportunities for your school, then please help me fill out the form so that the Program Director of Edoofa can contact you.

28/12/23, 2:44 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Ms Jasmine I have a question about the community building project
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Understood
28/12/23, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes please <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 2:47 PM - +27 73 743 6250: In the group I'm supposed to create,is it only supposed to be Zimbabwean students that I add or can I add South African students,who are currently doing matric as well.
28/12/23, 2:59 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 3:00 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Well understood Ms Jasmine, thank you
28/12/23, 3:01 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
28/12/23, 3:02 PM - +27 73 743 6250: May you please explain a bit further,I don't quite get it
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
28/12/23, 3:07 PM - +27 73 743 6250: Ohh okay , noted

28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
