This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

2/1/24, 1:53 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio, Tanatswa?

2/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 847 1404: I have to create a whatsapp group with you as my mentor inorder to add other students to the Edoofa program by entering other students unofficial whatsapp group and sharing the link
2/1/24, 2:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am impressed with your understanding.
2/1/24, 2:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
2/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 847 1404: Thank you
2/1/24, 2:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
