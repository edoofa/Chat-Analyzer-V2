▪️Could you share the reasons behind your recent session absences?
▪️Are you confident in your understanding of all the EWYL projects? If so, which one is your favorite project?

I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this message and confirmation of your understanding of the *new session timings.* <This message was edited>
