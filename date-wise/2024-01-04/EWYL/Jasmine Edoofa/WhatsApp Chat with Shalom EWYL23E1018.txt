28/12/23, 2:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
28/12/23, 2:41 PM - +263 78 089 1047: I understand
28/12/23, 2:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Are you ready for the session?
2/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 089 1047: I'm  doing  great
2/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Yes
2/1/24, 1:35 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So last time we were discussing Project 3
Do you remember?
2/1/24, 1:35 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Yes
2/1/24, 1:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
2/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 089 1047: 1) Nyamauru high school  no
2) 
3)Manicaland
2/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 089 1047: 2 l will share  the message
2/1/24, 1:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
2/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Yes l agree
2/1/24, 1:48 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
2/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Okay l will  do that
2/1/24, 1:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
2/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 089 1047: After  that am l going  to share the phone number  in here
2/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Headchirenje.vcf (file attached)
2/1/24, 2:02 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: First, let me explain the project and then I will let you know, what to do with this number.
2/1/24, 2:02 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
2/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Yes
2/1/24, 2:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
2/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Ok
2/1/24, 2:23 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Shalom, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
2/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 78 089 1047: I will modify  the message
2/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 089 1047: I want  to ask something
2/1/24, 2:29 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead
2/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Regarding the last project l manage to create a group  and l make my classmates  and others join
2/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 089 1047: I share  the offline form so that  they  will fill in
2/1/24, 2:34 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great, Shalom
2/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Thank you

2/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 089 1047: I'm  going  share this details  with the head
2/1/24, 3:16 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
2/1/24, 3:16 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
2/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Ok l will  that

3/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 089 1047: Noted
3/1/24, 2:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
