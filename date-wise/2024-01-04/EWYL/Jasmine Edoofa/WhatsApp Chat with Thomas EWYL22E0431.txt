Do you feel positive about the outcome, and do you think you'll perform exceptionally well?
3/1/24, 6:54 PM - +91 76965 03380: Yes I think the exams were very fair, and I have no doubt I did well.
3/1/24, 6:55 PM - +91 76965 03380: The exams were very intimidating at first but as time passed I got used to them.
3/1/24, 6:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great. Now, aim even higher for the upcoming semester, and I extend my heartfelt best wishes for your continued success.
3/1/24, 6:58 PM - +91 76965 03380: Great ma'am I will surely put my best effort for the upcoming semester. And Thank you.

Well, guess what?

3/1/24, 7:02 PM - +91 76965 03380: Great, I can't wait for the industrial visit.
3/1/24, 7:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The prospect of hands-on learning is truly thrilling. Right?
How does the idea of a fully paid trip sound to you? Are you excited?
3/1/24, 7:04 PM - +91 76965 03380: I'm very excited about the idea.
3/1/24, 7:06 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, have you shared this trip with your parents?
3/1/24, 7:08 PM - +91 76965 03380: Yes I have but I wasn't sure about the dates but now I know.
3/1/24, 7:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Speaking about the Big Day, I can't hold back my excitement! I've spent my entire New Year getting things ready, especially planning my outfits. How about you? What are your expectations for the event? What kinds of events do you think there will be?

Wait, have you even filled out that RSVP?
3/1/24, 7:19 PM - +91 76965 03380: 😃 I am still making my preparations for the day.
I think there are going to be events like speeches and poem or such things like that maybe, but the best part of this trip that gives me goose bumps is getting to interact with other Edoofians from different Universities and most importantly the above mentioned CEO's of great start-ups
3/1/24, 7:20 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you had a chance to check out the poster? 
Are you familiar with the backgrounds and achievements of all three speakers?
3/1/24, 7:23 PM - +91 76965 03380: Yes I have seen the poster. I am only aware of the founder and CEO of Sirona Hygiene. But as for the background and achievements I am not quite aware.
3/1/24, 7:25 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now since it is time to wrap up the session. In the end. I'd like you to search for these three speakers on Google and familiarize yourself with their backgrounds. 
I am also sharing your Wednesday Lesson below. Make sure you go through it and share your understanding by Friday.

It was lovely talking to you. Have a great evening!
