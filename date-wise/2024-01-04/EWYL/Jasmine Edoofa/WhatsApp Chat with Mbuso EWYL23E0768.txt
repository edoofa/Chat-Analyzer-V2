I hope you are doing well. Let us start our session with a fun question

If your pet could suddenly talk for one day, what do you think they would say or ask you?
3/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 71 542 9249: I m ready for today's session
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing Project 2
Do you remember?
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - +263 71 542 9249: Yes
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
3/1/24, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

3/1/24, 2:53 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
3/1/24, 2:53 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 71 542 9249: I am required to reach out to local schools in my local area where I will speak to the decision makers of the local schools to join the edoofa community in which will help them to grow using the experience of edoofa. This improve communication skills and my confidence.
3/1/24, 3:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you today. 

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

*Now, I will meet you on Friday from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm.* <This message was edited>
