3/1/24, 3:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening Nkosilomusa
I trust this message finds you well. 
I hope your New Year was enjoyable and filled with positive experiences.
3/1/24, 3:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I'm curious about how your end-of-semester exams went. Since it was your first time taking them, I'm interested in your experience. How did it go for you? 

Do you feel positive about the outcome, and do you think you'll perform exceptionally well?
3/1/24, 3:36 PM - +91 78886 93132: Okay, Regarding the exams, they were quite challenging, testing my understanding across various subjects. Despite the difficulty, I believe the rigorous preparation will yield positive results. Notably, the Aerospace Engineering Drawing exam posed a considerable challenge, demanding a comprehensive grasp of intricate concepts. I am optimistic about the outcome, as I dedicated extra effort to excel in this specific area. The difficulty served as a valuable learning experience, pushing me to refine my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of the subject matter. I am eagerly awaiting the results, confident that my hard work will reflect in improved academic performance.
3/1/24, 3:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you had a chance to discuss your exams and how they went with your parents?
3/1/24, 3:39 PM - +91 78886 93132: No ma'am. I think discussing with them or not will not change anything 🤣🤣. So I just kept quiet and I'm waiting for the results.
3/1/24, 3:39 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Why do you say that, Nkosilomusa.
3/1/24, 3:42 PM - +91 78886 93132: They were very challenging ma'am, and I don't want to stress my parents now. It's better for them to see the results on their own than making them think that I failed and when the results comes, they see that I have passed or making them think that I did well and then the results come opposite. 
So I just decided to keep quiet 🤐
3/1/24, 3:44 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: How often do you talk to your parents, Nkosilomusa?
3/1/24, 3:44 PM - +91 78886 93132: They text me Almost everyday but I avoid that topic 🤣. And sometimes I don't respond because they see me  as a newly born baby yet I'm turning 20 this year. I believe I'm growing and I have to keep certain things to myself and learn to solve my problem <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 3:52 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Nkosilomusa, this is a positive sign. It indicates genuine concern and care for you. If discussing exams is uncomfortable, that's completely okay. 
Keep the communication open, and do talk to them regularly
3/1/24, 3:53 PM - +91 78886 93132: Okay ma'am.
3/1/24, 3:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'm sure by now, many of you have been buzzing with anticipation, having snippets of conversations with the DSW, and catching wind of something big from the team.
Well, guess what?
