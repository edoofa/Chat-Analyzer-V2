Do you remember?
2/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I do remember
2/1/24, 2:15 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

2/1/24, 2:21 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 71 462 8444: The task is to identify African schools  and introduce them in more detail about Edoofa scholarship program.  The student should reach out to the headmast or principal of the school. Share more detail about Edoofa to them and ask them if they can set up a virtual meeting with the board members of Edoofa to explore possible collaborations which is the pursued goal

3/1/24, 1:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon*
I hope you are doing well. Let us start our session with a fun question

If your pet could suddenly talk for one day, what do you think they would say or ask you?
3/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 462 8444: 😅When are we going to the park again?
3/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 71 462 8444: Good afternoon
3/1/24, 1:49 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Ah, the classic park question! Your pet's enthusiasm is contagious. Your playful response could be:

"How about this weekend? We'll have a 'bark-tastic' time.
3/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 71 462 8444: 😅
3/1/24, 1:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing Project 3
Do you remember?
3/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I remember
3/1/24, 1:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
3/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 462 8444: 1. MARANATHA ADVENTIST HIGH SCHOOL 

No it is not connected with Edoofa

3. Bulawayo
3/1/24, 2:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
3/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 71 462 8444: Yes I agree
3/1/24, 2:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
3/1/24, 2:14 PM - +263 71 462 8444: Okay I understand
3/1/24, 2:24 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
3/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 462 8444: Thank you 
Yes I am ready
3/1/24, 2:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
3/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 462 8444: Okay
3/1/24, 2:39 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Sharon, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
3/1/24, 3:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you today. 

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

*Now, I will meet you on Friday from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm.*
3/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 71 462 8444: Okay Ms Jasmine i will get on it
