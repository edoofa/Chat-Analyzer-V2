There is one thing that I wanted to share with you. Edoofa is organizing a fully sponsered industrial visit *for our students here in India*
Today I am a little occupied with the planning for the event so I would like to reschedule the session to tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm.

Kindly excuse me for the inconveniences caused but don't worry we will definitely make up for it tomorrow.
Have a nice day ahead.
27/12/23, 2:47 PM - +263 78 046 5800: You too ma'am

Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society?
29/12/23, 1:57 PM - +263 78 046 5800: The science land and the principle would be helping and creating social interaction with students who like science.
29/12/23, 2:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: "The Science Land" is a captivating and imaginative name for a utopian society, and the focus on helping and creating social interaction among students who share an interest in science is a wonderful concept.
29/12/23, 2:37 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the documents?
29/12/23, 2:39 PM - +263 78 046 5800: Yes

3/1/24, 1:40 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon*
I hope you are doing well. Let us start our session with a fun question

If your pet could suddenly talk for one day, what do you think they would say or ask you?
3/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 78 046 5800: What food are we having today?
3/1/24, 1:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It's like having a gourmet critic at home!
3/1/24, 1:57 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. We must have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
3/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 046 5800: I'm here
3/1/24, 1:59 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday*
3/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 046 5800: Okay
3/1/24, 2:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
3/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 046 5800: Thank you ma'am
3/1/24, 2:23 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

3/1/24, 2:23 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 78 046 5800: I have just finished reading the newsletter
3/1/24, 3:04 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you today. 

Tomorrow, I'll be occupied organizing an industrial visit for our students here in India, and as a result, there won't be a session. I really appreciate your understanding.

*Now, I will meet you on Friday from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm.*
3/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 78 046 5800: Okay ma'am thank you for the session
