27/12/23, 3:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Neo,

I hope this message finds you well amidst your ongoing exams. I couldn't help but notice that I haven't received a Christmas greeting from you. I understand that exam preparations are consuming much of your time and energy, but it's disheartening to see that you couldn't spare a couple of minutes to extend your wishes.

As your mentor, I've been supportive and have even provided you with holidays to dedicate to your exam preparations. However, it's disconcerting to witness a lack of acknowledgment or a brief moment taken to convey your holiday wishes.

Is there something on your mind, or is there a reason for this silence?
27/12/23, 5:08 PM - +91 95012 69490: Greetings ma'am
27/12/23, 5:09 PM - +91 95012 69490: Sorry for not wishing you but the thing is l don't celebrate Christmas it's against my religion
28/12/23, 4:25 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Neo!

I understand that things have not always aligned with how they are planned. It's life, dear; one will face many instances in their life. However, moving out of your comfort zone is something you do when you wish to move ahead in your life.

Being your mentor, I am always here to listen and help you. However, I understand that sometimes your mentor can also feel a bit neglected. Therefore, always try to answer or respond to whatever has been asked.
28/12/23, 5:07 PM - +91 95012 69490: Sorry ma'am
28/12/23, 5:08 PM - +91 95012 69490: I will do so ma'am
