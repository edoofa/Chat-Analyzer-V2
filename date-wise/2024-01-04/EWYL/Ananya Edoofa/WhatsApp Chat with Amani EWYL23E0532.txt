I was handling some concerning matters on the other side.

I've been waiting for this moment indeed, and finally, my curiosity is almost at its peak of satisfaction. However, I am not completely or fully aware of the main purpose of the occasion. I'm so interested in knowing more. Due to the limited time and my late reply, I understand this may cause the inconvenience of explaining fully. You may at least share with me the resources or texts, and I can go through them intensively.

Thank you!
