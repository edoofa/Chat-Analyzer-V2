28/12/23, 8:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Tadiwanashe,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.
28/12/23, 10:55 AM - +263 71 239 0648: Is it possible to move our sessions to Saturday only where we can use more time
29/12/23, 8:43 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tadiwanashe,
How are you?
29/12/23, 8:45 AM - Saloni Edoofa: For me to accommodate that schedule, I would have to know the reason behind shifting it to Saturday, you availability and purpose?
29/12/23, 1:57 PM - +263 71 239 0648: Good afternoon Ms Saloni, How are you?
29/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 71 239 0648: Oh yes the reason I want to shift the schedule is because I found a part time job where I am currently working during the day for 5 days a week. At times I even go to work on Saturdays so if possible we can shift them to Sundays where I promise to be there all day.
