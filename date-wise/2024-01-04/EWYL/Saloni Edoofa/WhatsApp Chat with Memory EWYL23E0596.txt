26/12/23, 8:42 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How was your Christmas celebration🎄?

I am so excited to see how you celebrated it with your loved ones and friends, and yes, what all you receive in your gifts🎁?

We will discuss all this in our scheduled session that will be happening from *01:30-02:30 PM* this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday.
Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
26/12/23, 9:52 AM - +263 71 401 4355: Greetings Ms Saloni!.The Christmas celebrations were great💯 though we did not do much rather a family gathering since our culture does not permit us to celebrate Christmas. I would have loved to share the pictures with you but unfortunately I am not a huge fan of the camera😔. And if possible may I be excused for today's session please. The farm workers have not resumed from the holidays yet so I'll be helping out today.
26/12/23, 1:34 PM - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with the session?
26/12/23, 1:36 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad that you had a lovely time with your loved ones and yes, please take today's time. I understand your commitments.

26/12/23, 3:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

27/12/23, 1:39 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Memory, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

27/12/23, 1:45 PM - +263 71 401 4355: May I please ask?
27/12/23, 1:48 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes go on
27/12/23, 1:49 PM - +263 71 401 4355: When am I supposed to start the project and when is it due?
27/12/23, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
27/12/23, 1:55 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Ma'am  thank you
27/12/23, 1:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any questions about this, Memory? I can help you.
27/12/23, 1:57 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Yes. So this means I may start project 1 today or there is more I need to understand before I commence?
27/12/23, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you go through all the projects once and then decide on how and on which project you need to work.
27/12/23, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Memory, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Memory!
27/12/23, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:14 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Maam thank you. So it really does not matter which project I start first? I may also start with the one I understand the most?
27/12/23, 2:14 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Ma'am
27/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Noted Ma'am
27/12/23, 2:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you can do that
27/12/23, 2:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Did you listen to the audio?
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - +263 71 401 4355: I've understood this very well thank you!
27/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you
27/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Yes Ma'am
27/12/23, 2:23 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from it?
27/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 71 401 4355: I've understood that for the sake of community building and organization growth the purpose of project to is to create  networking and persuasion skills to link with students around Africa and refer them to the Edoofa programme. The students may also be friends, family or relatives who habe graduated from senior secondary school or in the past 6 months. After successfully finishing the project scholarship credits are offered that is $20 for every student enrolled in the EDOOFA scholarship programme, $30 for completion of Admission Formalities of the university and an additional opportunity of earning $5 worth scholarship credits per student that EDOOFA connects with you for clarity on the programme. Thank you

 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
28/12/23, 1:47 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Noted thank you.
28/12/23, 1:47 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Quick question please
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, go on.
28/12/23, 1:51 PM - +263 71 401 4355: So if the students fill in the applications I send back the filled applications to you right?
28/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 71 401 4355: As well as the screenshots of the rejected alliances from the companies?
28/12/23, 1:58 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is true
28/12/23, 1:59 PM - Saloni Edoofa: You can share with me what communication you have done with them
28/12/23, 2:01 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Oky thank you Ma'am
28/12/23, 2:01 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Noted Ma'am
28/12/23, 2:09 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/12/23, 2:11 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Ma'am
28/12/23, 2:11 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*MEMORY/SALONI/28DEC2023*
28/12/23, 2:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/12/23, 2:12 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Noted.Thank you
28/12/23, 2:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
28/12/23, 2:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
28/12/23, 2:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
28/12/23, 2:16 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Noted thank you
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what have you understood from the process?
28/12/23, 2:35 PM - +263 71 401 4355: I understood that to make the project easy it is wiser to form a WhatsApp group with my name and the name of my mentor. We also need to find the right applicants and share them about EDOOFA. To get the right students I have to reach out to the form 6 and the form 5 students and share the link to my WhatsApp group and share information  about the opportunity to get the chance to get education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100%.
28/12/23, 3:06 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
28/12/23, 3:08 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you
29/12/23, 1:42 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Memory,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
29/12/23, 1:43 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Good afternoon Ma'am. Yes we may begin our session please
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have got it absolutely  right🫶🏻
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you
29/12/23, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.

29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*.

I thanked God for the previous year and all the lifetime lessons taught which include staying positive about success, cherishing my loved ones whist they are still alive for noone knows what will happen tommorrow, learning from my mistakes and accepting corrections. And this year I tild myself that I'll never repeat the mistakes I did last year and neither am I gonna trumble nor break down in tough situans rather I'm going to woman up and fight my way towards a bright future. And guess what😱? I also added another long term goal in my life and that is creating my own law firm,  I being the CEO. I just figured it will be exciting having something I can call my own and being my own boss😁 .At this period I'll be waiting for my ZIMSEC A'level results and I  really am praying that I will obtain very pleasing results and I also trust that my God has a good surprise in store for me💯
