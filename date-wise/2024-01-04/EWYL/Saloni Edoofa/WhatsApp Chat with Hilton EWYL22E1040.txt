Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*.

3/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 71 641 5156: Sometimes l won't have access to the internet and we are also experiencing power cuts on our side leading to my phone not having battery, so by the time l charge my phone and switch it on the session will be over
