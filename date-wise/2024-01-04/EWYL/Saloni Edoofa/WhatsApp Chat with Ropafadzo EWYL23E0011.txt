27/12/23, 1:29 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Ropafadzo,
I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the year, I am filled with excitement about the upcoming new year. It's a time for optimism, hope, and the opportunity to nurture beautifully curated relationships. However, upon reflection on our journey so far, I recognize a bit of inconsistency and irregularity.

I understand that the holiday season, including Christmas celebrations and New Year enjoyment, may be keeping you occupied. Despite this, I believe it's important for us to consider how we can strengthen our relationship in the EWYL Program. I am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can restart and enhance our collaboration.

How are you?
28/12/23, 8:31 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you please help me with knowing this, it may also be possible that I might have not understood something well. I really wish to know your side? <This message was edited>

29/12/23, 8:39 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Ropafadzo,
How are you?

No worries, let me breakdown my words into simpler form. What I meant by that message was that I really wish to see you making continued growth and success through projects but lately, due to inactiveness and irregularly from either end, the consistency is not maintained hence a fruitful session is not happening. May I know if you can share any challenges from your end?

29/12/23, 3:19 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻
