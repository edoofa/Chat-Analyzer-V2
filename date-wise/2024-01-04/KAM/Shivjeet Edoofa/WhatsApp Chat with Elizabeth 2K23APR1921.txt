As per our recent conversation, your fees were extended till the 28th of Nov. meaning that the second payment falls after a month that is 28th Dec. Hence I would like to let you know that since we are approaching the month's end may I know if you might be able to share an update with me regarding the payment. I will be having a meeting with the university officials tomorrow and will be discussing the same with them. I do not want this delay to affect your scholarship. Hence, may I know if you might be able to share an update about the second payment if not made the payment yet? Will you be able to make it by 5:00 PM tomorrow?

Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your university Registration Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
