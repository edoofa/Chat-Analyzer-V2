I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
21/12/23, 6:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Ashley!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I was not able to get a response from your end the previous day. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:28 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir I am
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I have asked you to share your academic documents with us. I am currently waiting for that we well.

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
21/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Ummmm ,  I think for this one you may give me some time , so that I can talk to the school authority
21/12/23, 7:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we can wait on the same. May I know by when you might be able to retrieve this form?
21/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I am sure I'll talk to them on Monday
21/12/23, 8:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, I shall wait on the same.
21/12/23, 8:24 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Okae Sir

29/12/23, 6:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Good evening sir
29/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 71 596 3939: I am ready Sir
29/12/23, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/12/23, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/12/23, 7:57 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir
29/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/12/23, 7:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/12/23, 8:00 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Ok sir go on
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 8:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 71 596 3939: Yes sir they are clear
29/12/23, 8:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
