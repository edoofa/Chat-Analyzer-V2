I would like to share an update with you that I will be having a meeting scheduled with the university tomorrow at 05:00 pm CAT and if you are able to make the payment before then, we will still be able to help you out and ensure that your scholarship application at the university is not affected. Hence could you please share me with you your input here if you might be able to do the needful?

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
