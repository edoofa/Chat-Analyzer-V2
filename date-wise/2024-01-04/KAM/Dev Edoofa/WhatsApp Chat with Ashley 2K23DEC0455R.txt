3/1/24, 9:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: It's crucial to print out these forms before our reconnection on January 4th, as the next batch for the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program is scheduled for 12th January. Starting from our sessions on the 4th, we aim to complete your initial admission formalities and provide guidance on steps needed before January 10th. Timely completion of these steps is vital for your EWYL Program commencement on January 12th. Failure to do so may result in a delay in your journey. Please understand the importance of printing out the forms in advance and ensure you do so.

1. A-Level Results/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).
2. O-Level Results.
3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate).
