I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
27/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Well, thank you 
We were very impressed by the way that Edoofa scholarship program was presented by Mr Shashwat .
To be honest we had no idea that the Edoofa scholarship program existed in this world but all thanks to Mr Shashwat he has been very professional.
He highlighted the cost of education in India which is $6000-$8000 because of the scholarship the education fee is reduced to $1200-$1800 which is a huge relief to parents and guardians.
In addition to that he mentioned the EWYL program which further discounts the fee.
Lastly the scholarship enriches the student with skills of  being employable.

Thank you
27/12/23, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: I have known Mr. Shashwat for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track.

28/12/23, 1:47 PM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Noted with thanks, yes we can proceed Sir.
28/12/23, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 2:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 77 821 9098: Noted
28/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes sir, well elaborated
28/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Quite clear Sir
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 2:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 77 382 1026: I understand it clearly
28/12/23, 2:25 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Yes sir, we are on the same page
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Let me understand on the registration fee of $500 to $1000 is this additional to the $350 that was paid already?
28/12/23, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Chando. To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000.
28/12/23, 2:51 PM - +263 77 382 1026: That's ok understood. Thank you
28/12/23, 2:51 PM - Dev Edoofa: You are most welcome!
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - Dev Edoofa: If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Yes we can proceed with the discussion Sir
28/12/23, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

28/12/23, 2:55 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
28/12/23, 2:56 PM - Dev Edoofa: Leah, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - +263 78 536 5920: All received but our internet is not that smooth so it might take time to see the videos and summarize them 
If possible can we schedule our next session for tomorrow.
Thank you.
28/12/23, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session.

They build some substances and break others down. All living things have enzymes. Our bodes naturally produce enzymes. 

Enzyme activity is the rate at which an enzyme catalyses, or speeds up a a reaction. 

There are a number of factors that affect enzyme activity, these include temperature, pH or acidity, concentration of enzymes, concentration of substrates and the presence of inhibitors and activators.

Enzymes work best at specific temperatures and if the temperature is too high or too low the enzyme will become denatured and stop working.

Enzymes also have an optimal pH and if the pH is too high or too low the enzyme will denature. 

If there are too few enzymes, the reaction will proceed slowly. On the other hand if there are too many enzymes they will start to compete for substrates and the reaction will proceed more slowly. 

The concentration of substrates also affects enzyme activity, if there are too few substrates, the enzyme will not be able to find wnough of them to react on.


Lastly inhibitors and activators, inhibitors a slow down enzyme activity while activators increase it.
