3/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Ok
3/1/24, 9:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Coming back to the admission. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/1/24, 9:13 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes they are clear
3/1/24, 9:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 997 2192: I will fix it tomorrow morning
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: Noted!
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: please let me know if you are clear about these steps?
3/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes l am following
3/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes l am clear
3/1/24, 9:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/1/24, 9:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
3/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes they are clear as well
3/1/24, 9:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
3/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yed
3/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
3/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/1/24, 9:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
3/1/24, 9:28 AM - +263 78 997 2192: Yes
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: This message was deleted
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
3/1/24, 9:31 AM - Dev Edoofa: Diolyne, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
3/1/24, 9:40 AM - +263 78 997 2192: The first video focuses on the qualities of successful students on Edoofa. It is important for students to understand the value of consistency and discipline, both of which are essential for success.
The second video explains the vision of Edoofa and the reason why they exist. Understanding the reason behind a platform can help students find their own vision and align it with the platform.
And the third video is focused on the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa platform. It's always important to know the  institutes that are on Edoofa. Knowing more about the schools and colleges can help students find the right fit for their academic and career goals.
I hope this helps clarify my understanding of these videos. Is there anything else you'd like to know about them?
3/1/24, 9:46 AM - +263 78 997 2192: The first video focuses on the qualities of successful students on Edoofa. It is important for students to understand the value of consistency and discipline, both of which are essential for success.

3/1/24, 9:52 AM - +263 78 997 2192: From my understanding, this video emphasizes the importance of taking the time to write a strong and compelling SOP. It also highlights the need to be authentic and genuine in the SOP, as schools want to get to know the real person behind the application. In addition, the video discusses the importance of editing and proofreading the SOP before submitting it.
3/1/24, 9:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: Great! Thank you for being sincere during the sessions.
