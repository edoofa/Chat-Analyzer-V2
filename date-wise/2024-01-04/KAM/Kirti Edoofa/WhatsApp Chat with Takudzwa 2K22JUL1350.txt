I trust this message finds you well.

Over the past couple of weeks, I have been expecting a response from your end so that we can complete the remaining university admission formalities. I am sure you are aware that we have been working towards Takudzwa's application since July 2022 and now that you have your offer letter and you were able to complete half of the registration formalities you are now to complete the remaining registration formalities. We tried to reach out for an update, especially since our last conversation where you planned to make the fee payment through Mama Money and requested an order for it. However, we haven't heard from you since then. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 7:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I've noticed that you've read my previous messages but haven't responded. I believe that there might be something preventing you from getting in touch. Please let me know is my understanding is correct? <This message was edited>

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. In that case, may I know by when will I be able to connect with your mother?
27/12/23, 6:21 PM - +263 77 317 5959: Early January
27/12/23, 7:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what happened, I am worried because she has not been active for the past few weeks it would be great if you could let us know your challenges so that I will be able to assist you?
27/12/23, 8:33 PM - +263 77 317 5959: She lost her phone  so she doesn't have a phone these days
28/12/23, 4:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not getting back to you yesterday, as it was almost past my available hours. Thank you for letting me know that, however, may I know the reason for you not connecting with us for the past few weeks, because if even your mother lost her phone, I would have appreciated if you kept us updated as we were worried about you.
28/12/23, 11:22 PM - +263 77 317 5959: I'm sorry for not replying I was in rural areas so my network was bad

I hope you are doing well. It is alright please, I understand that networking can be a challenge. May I know if you are comfortable proceeding with the discussion today since the university is closing its round of application on the 31st of this month?

2/1/24, 3:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773175959I completely understand that your mother is not available at the moment and unavailable to connect. However, I hope you understand that you have missed your deadline and the universities also need to be fair to other students as well. I would please encourage you to be available for a discussion so that I can assist you here?
2/1/24, 9:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
