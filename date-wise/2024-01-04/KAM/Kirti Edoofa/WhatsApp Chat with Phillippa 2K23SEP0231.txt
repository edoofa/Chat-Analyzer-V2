I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

20/12/23, 8:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:02 PM - +263 71 544 9247: Thank you very much team. I will discuss with my daughter but to me 06:00pm is perfect
20/12/23, 9:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am glad to know that you have acknowledged the message and I look forward to connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm CAT.
20/12/23, 9:08 PM - +263 71 544 9247: Ok fine
20/12/23, 9:12 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Thank you so much for the Wonderful messages, I'll be sure to attend our session Tomorrow
21/12/23, 5:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Phillippa,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
21/12/23, 5:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
21/12/23, 5:55 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Good Evening Ms Kirti, Yes we are very excited
21/12/23, 5:55 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Oh Yes I did
21/12/23, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
21/12/23, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
21/12/23, 5:57 PM - +263 77 766 6158: It works for me
21/12/23, 5:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
21/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Okay
21/12/23, 6:04 PM - +263 77 766 6158: 1. 975 USD 
2. 3 years 
3. 200 USD 
4. 700  USD
21/12/23, 6:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
21/12/23, 6:06 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Yes it is
21/12/23, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
21/12/23, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
21/12/23, 6:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
21/12/23, 6:08 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Alright
21/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
21/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
21/12/23, 6:10 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Yes I am
21/12/23, 6:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
21/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Yes I am
21/12/23, 6:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on 3rd January 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
21/12/23, 6:29 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Yes We are
21/12/23, 6:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/12/23, 6:31 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Please do Explain
21/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of January 3, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of February 3, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before January 3, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 6:34 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Yes we are
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/12/23, 6:36 PM - +263 77 766 6158: I reside in Budiriro 5 Harare
21/12/23, 6:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/12/23, 6:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/12/23, 6:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/12/23, 6:40 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Thank you
21/12/23, 6:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/12/23, 6:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/12/23, 6:41 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Ms Kirti , my date of birth is wrong on  the offer letter
21/12/23, 6:42 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Yes Please
21/12/23, 6:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me that, I have updated the team about the same, it must be a clerical error by the university please do not worry about it.
21/12/23, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi

Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
21/12/23, 6:49 PM - +263 71 544 9247: Noted
21/12/23, 6:49 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Thank you very much
21/12/23, 6:50 PM - +263 77 766 6158: My results will be out early February so I cannot submit them before 31 December <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 6:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Let me help you understand better, you do not have to worry about it. Phillippa what you are reading here in the offer letter is the standard statement for every student. So you do not have to worry about it, please.
21/12/23, 6:53 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Alright Thank you very much
21/12/23, 6:54 PM - +263 71 544 9247: Does her scholarship percentage change if she achieves better results?
21/12/23, 6:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263715449247 if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention to the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of the Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
21/12/23, 6:57 PM - +263 71 544 9247: Yes very much, thank you
21/12/23, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.
21/12/23, 7:00 PM - +263 71 544 9247: Ok cool
21/12/23, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/12/23, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/12/23, 7:01 PM - +263 77 766 6158: Yes
21/12/23, 7:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/12/23, 7:04 PM - +263 71 544 9247: Kindly send other diploma programs offered by the university?
21/12/23, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263715449247 surely, however, let us complete with our discussion regarding the letter first so that your understanding of the same gets better.
21/12/23, 7:26 PM - +263 71 544 9247: Ok fine
21/12/23, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
21/12/23, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
21/12/23, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
21/12/23, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

21/12/23, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
21/12/23, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
21/12/23, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Saturday which is 23rd of December. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. I understand that, however, may I know what challenges you faced due to which you were unable to make the deposit today since today was Phillippa's deadline?
