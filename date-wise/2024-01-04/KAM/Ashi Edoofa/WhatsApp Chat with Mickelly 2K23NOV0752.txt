21/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
21/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
21/12/23, 3:20 PM - +263 77 149 9307: 1.$350
2.$0
3.$1600
4.$125
5.$1000
21/12/23, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
21/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 77 149 9307: We are excited for her but afraid that on our part this $1000 to secure the scholarship is still a lot
21/12/23, 3:24 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Considering as well the due date you gave
21/12/23, 3:25 PM - +263 77 149 9307: From the start we had been given a range of $500-$700
21/12/23, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263771499307, I will definitely assist you here please don't worry.
21/12/23, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
21/12/23, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
21/12/23, 3:31 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Okay I understand so if I pay $1000 then $600 is left?
21/12/23, 3:32 PM - +263 77 149 9307: After reducing the cost of first year student what will become the annual fee
21/12/23, 3:32 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Aren't there other schools she got accepted so that we compare
21/12/23, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 For the first year, the amount which is left after paying the registration fees will be $850. Regarding your concern about the other university, let me share that this is the first offer letter we have received for Mickelly please.
21/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
21/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
21/12/23, 3:37 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Okay let's continue
21/12/23, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/12/23, 3:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
21/12/23, 3:40 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Okay
21/12/23, 3:41 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Okay
21/12/23, 3:41 PM - +263 77 149 9307: We understand but still the $1000 is a lot considering the due date. We won't be able to make it
21/12/23, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 I understand your thoughts please don't worry as we have a flexible payment plan for you which will be shared with you shortly. At the moment can we go ahead with the discussion please?
21/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 77 149 9307: That is okay
21/12/23, 3:47 PM - +263 77 149 9307: We can proceed
21/12/23, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263771499307, Kindly don't worry we will definitely help you with your concern please.
21/12/23, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600- $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/12/23, 3:54 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes it does
21/12/23, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/12/23, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
21/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Are you saying we are paying $1000 then fees that will be left is $850
21/12/23, 4:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263771499307. Now, I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
21/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
21/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
21/12/23, 4:25 PM - +263 77 149 9307: It makes sense but to me as a parent can't afford that much .Since you say it's her first offer letter  when can we expect some other offer letter from different universities so that we can reconsider .Noone will assist me to pay that figure $1850 for the first year ,in addition to that there is visa and a ticket to be paid .Maybe if we can get a university which need at least $350 to $500 to secure a scholarship .
21/12/23, 4:27 PM - +263 77 149 9307: That MVN university can't they reduce their admission fee and we pay the rest in instalments
21/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your thoughts @263771499307 and these are absolutely fine. I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Mickelly is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
21/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
21/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes l understand the whole story ,bt I'm a low income parent but lm sure there are other universities in India which offers reasonable fees annually bt still their registration fee will not be high like $1000.Civil servants in Zimbabwe earn $300 as a salary and step father of Mickely is the only bread winner in a family ,myself I'm not working .Mickelly have got siblings who need fees and so forth to survive.Parents at rural home needs help from us.Maybe if we can save $150 per month up to July that way l can starve .That $1000 can't be payable within 15 days .I don't know if you can negotiate for us to pay in instalments that $1000
21/12/23, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern with us, I appreciate your honesty. While I understand that you have challenges with the registration fees as you are thinking that the amount of $1000 for the registration fees is high. Is my understanding right?
21/12/23, 5:00 PM - +263 77 149 9307: $1000 to a civil servant in Zimbabwe is very high honestly speaking .
21/12/23, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263771499307, I will definitely try my best to help you here.
21/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 3rd, 2024*
21/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/12/23, 5:05 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes sir you can go on.
21/12/23, 5:09 PM - +263 77 149 9307: $100 grant for endowment plan ,l know it bt still to me it makes no different because $900 it's still a lot
21/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$450 before the first deadline date of January 3rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of February 3rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before *January 3rd, 2024* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 5:17 PM - +263 77 149 9307: My husband earns $300 ,at least if you say $450 first instalment in Feb and then the other $450 we pay in 2 instalments .You don't know how we struggled to pay enrolment fee .Things are not well in Zimbabwe.
21/12/23, 5:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand from where you are coming, and being your admission officer I will had a conversation with the university officials to tackle the financial challenges you're facing concerning the upcoming registration fee. Based on our records, the total amount required for your child's admission to the university is $900, with a $100 designated for enrollment, summing up to $1000.
21/12/23, 5:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In an effort to find a workable solution, I have been exploring the potential of establishing a payment plan. However, before finalizing this plan, it's important that we gain a comprehensive understanding of your current financial situation.
21/12/23, 5:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to understand the amount you've managed to set aside for your admission fee by the upcoming due date of *January 3rd, 2024*. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
21/12/23, 5:30 PM - +263 77 149 9307: First year annual fee it's a hard nut to crack ,maybe second year will be much better
21/12/23, 5:31 PM - +263 77 149 9307: $200
21/12/23, 5:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263771499307, While considering the current situation, May I kindly know when you will be able to pay the remaining amount?
21/12/23, 5:36 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I will manage to pay $250 by 3rd Feb and the other $450 will pay it in 2 instalments March and April
21/12/23, 5:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 I understand your situation, and will try my best to help you here. However, as you are aware that you have a benefit of $100 due to the Endowment benefits. With the above payment plan you have shared, you will end up completing the registration process by April and by this month the endowment benefits will be over hence, you might end up paying the complete registration fees which is $1000. Are you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out with the suggested payment plan by you.? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Endowment benefits are entitled if l pay the registration fee in 1 month  is it so.What was the purpose of enrolment fee in this case ?
21/12/23, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The enrollment fees is for the enrollment in Edoofa Scholarship Program please. Considering that Mickelly is a student under the Edoofa Program, and we have made a promise to help you secure your scholarship seat, we are always here to help you in such situation so that you can secure the scholarship seat. However, given that you have also been granted the Endowment Grant of $100, it might not be possible for you to extend the payment till April. We understand how the endowment benefits come into play and help you out. With that said, l would like to share an alternative with you. May I share the same with you?
21/12/23, 6:15 PM - +263 77 149 9307: You can share
21/12/23, 6:16 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Still endowment of $100 is very little considering the figure to be paid as admission fee .
21/12/23, 6:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share the two options with you while considering the current situation. The first option is that you can skip the endowment benefits and can make the registration fees in the installment by the month of April.
21/12/23, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The alternative option with the endowment benefit is that you can make the first installment of $200 by the deadline date of 3rd of January. The remaining amount of the registration fees which is $700 can be divided into 3 installment. For better understanding, let me share an example with you please -
21/12/23, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. $250 can be paid by the end of January
2. $200 can be paid by the mid of February
3. $250 can be paid by the end of February
21/12/23, 6:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know what are your thoughts here.
21/12/23, 6:33 PM - +263 77 149 9307: This one can't manage where will l get the money to pay 2 instalments per month .We get 1 salary per month.Let me skip the endowment then l will  I will work with the instalments up to April
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263771499307, I will discuss you concern with the team tomorrow in order to see if there is any other alternative we can help you with.
21/12/23, 6:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope that's okay?
21/12/23, 6:38 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Ok Sir ,this university is expensive ,l can't afford .Even those instalments up to April l will be starving with the whole family for me to pay all instalments .
21/12/23, 6:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 I was going through your application file and find that the cost of education range shared with you was $2000 to $3000. According to the offer letter, we share with you Mickelly's per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
21/12/23, 6:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know what are your expectations ?
21/12/23, 6:51 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I was expecting $1200 per year without scholarship or if it was $1600 without scholar ship it was better.Another option if it was $3000 per annum without scholarship then they offer that 90 percent it was better.MVN it's $5000 something without scholarship so it's demn expensive even if they offer 90 percent it seems there is no scholarship offered .
21/12/23, 6:53 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Someone from a loyal can afford that university not low income families
21/12/23, 7:00 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Five years it's a long , so try to help me with some institutes which are affordable
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Let's reconnect tomorrow so that we can have a further discussion about your concerns in order to find a suitable solution.
21/12/23, 7:03 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Other universities without scholarship are paying that $1600 or $1200 so it should be less if they offer scholarship.
26/12/23, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Mickelly !

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
26/12/23, 8:31 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes we did.
26/12/23, 8:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
26/12/23, 8:45 PM - +263 77 149 9307: The biggest worry is on how and where to get the money  considering the stipuated time .Yes we are excited but that issue of money draws down the excitement.
26/12/23, 8:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263771499307, However we have shared the payment plan as per your request. I hope you remember the same?
26/12/23, 8:49 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes l know bt what was a bit flexible is to start payment end of January ,bt you kept on insisting that we have to do a payment on 3rd of January that's where my worry is.
26/12/23, 11:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. I was occupied with a meeting which was then accompanied by my dinner break, I would love to answer your concern and move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 04:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
27/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mickelly, Wishing you a good day!
27/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
27/12/23, 4:33 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Good afternoon ,I'm available
27/12/23, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response @263771499307, As you mentioned that you have some concern with the payment plan, May I know what is the challenge there?
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - +263 77 149 9307: This festive season it's a big challenge to get the money .Most people are focusing on paying school fees ,stationary anything which has to do with opening of schools so other sources where to get money will become a big challenge
27/12/23, 4:43 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Month-end of January after getting salaries every activity will start to kick off but as of now situation is unbearable
27/12/23, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 Based on your response, I had the discussion with the academic board and they have shared that considering that you have genuine challenge we can request the university officials with the suggested payment plan. Now, you are mentioning that you will be able to pay the registration fees by end of January, I am a bit confused here please
27/12/23, 4:45 PM - +263 77 149 9307: My request is why your administration is refusing to shift the dates because Mickelly is starting in August so there is still ample time for us to make some payments towards that
27/12/23, 4:47 PM - +263 77 149 9307: The problem is you were putting pressure insisting me to pay something by 3rd January ,but to me it was not easy
27/12/23, 4:49 PM - +263 77 149 9307: End of January and end of February that's when we can have some money to do the payments
27/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. I completely understand where you are coming from. However, I would like to inform you that the deadlines are not shared by us, these deadlines are shared by the university. After working with the Universities for the past couple of years and counseling 1000+ students I understand the reason that these timelines are in place. As you are aware this scholarship opportunity is a worldwide opportunity and not only for your child's rights, and a scholarship comes with a limited number of seats so even if the academic year commences in August- September, the seats would not be available and this is the reasons students are proactive in the admissions at the university.
27/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The idle timeline is 15 days as per the university if someone wants to secure their seat with the university however since you are enrolled through Edoofa and we are aware of the challenges that parents face since these are not new challenges, parents go through them frequently this is the reason why we have meetings with the universities and came up with the Endowment Program which was discussed with you
27/12/23, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This approval of the endowment program was possible because of the hard work and the number of arrivals that was possible last year and based on that the university has not only given us the time to pay the registration fees within 45 days but they have also given us an opportunity where we are able to pay $100 out of the $1000 registration on your behalf. Now when you see this you already have a 45-day time given by the university with a scholarship if you had to a regular admission you could do that in January next year but at that time you would not be getting the benefits of the endowment since your first deadline stands on 3rd January so you have to consider that this is an opportunity for you that is benefiting you only if you keep looking at it as a burden then you will not be able to see the bigger picture.
27/12/23, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: While all of this is true I understand that even after 45 days the financial challenges cannot be resolved considering the economy there. The challenge that you are facing is very common many parents go through the same and I believe this is exactly why you wanted Mickelly to study abroad in the first place so that he does not go through the same challenges that you are going through in the coming 10 years, right?
27/12/23, 5:35 PM - +263 77 149 9307: The time frame of the university is not easy because we only get money month-end not every 1st week of the month .Short notices are very difficulty to deal with as if by that time we receive messages will be having money already set aside for that
27/12/23, 5:36 PM - +263 77 149 9307: The challenges are there but if we are given enough time to source the money it will be fine .p
27/12/23, 5:39 PM - +263 77 149 9307: That $100 I'm still struggling to get it because it's festive season but month-end definitely l will be having something
27/12/23, 5:41 PM - +263 77 149 9307: It's not a burden to me but the time it is needed people will not   have money so there no one who can loan me that money
27/12/23, 5:45 PM - +263 77 149 9307: We can't talk of January next year as if lm saying the whole l won't be able to pay that money ,I'm giving an excuse for 3rd January bt end of January and end of February l can manage
27/12/23, 5:45 PM - +263 77 149 9307: *the whole year
27/12/23, 5:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your situation @263771499307, As you mentioned that you receive your salary at the end of the month, hence I am not able to understand why you are not able to make the minimum payment of $100 by 3rd of January ?
27/12/23, 5:48 PM - +263 77 149 9307: By the time you give us the message we had already paid school fees for siblings of Mickelly .
27/12/23, 5:49 PM - +263 77 149 9307: So we are done with that we are now focusing on that admission fee.
27/12/23, 5:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 I am not able to understand here, I believe you will receive your salary in the upcoming days right?
27/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 77 149 9307: No ,the companies differ because if it's festive season some offices quickly close for holidays so they give salaries earlier than other months .So  Mickelly's siblings are 3 who wanted their fees to be paid earlier.The fees are for January and covers the whole term .
27/12/23, 5:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the clarity here @263771499307, I understand that you want to complete the formalities by end of January. However, you know the universities are also restricted with the due dates that they share with the students considering that there are only a limited number of seats and they have to be fair to each and every student.
27/12/23, 5:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would want to help you out but this is something that the university would not approve and to help you further we have helped you with more flexible payment plan. We are here to guide you throughout the process, please, and if you recall our earlier discussion, you were fully aware of the fact the registration fee of $1000 would required for Mickelly's process and the registration process would be starting from August 2024, may I know if you recall this conversation that you had with Mr. Shivjeet?
27/12/23, 5:57 PM - +263 77 149 9307: If get that $100 I will pay ,but if l won't be able to get may you please look for other university for my child which allow me to pay end of January.I understand it's not the only university in India which we can deal with.
27/12/23, 6:02 PM - +263 77 149 9307: You were just giving examples saying let's say the registration fee is between $500 to $750 you never mentioned that it's definite that the registration fee will be exactly like such a figure and to my surprise that university is requesting more amount than you were expecting .Of which to me it's fine but l only want the university with extended dates so that l can be able to pay in time l will not miss the dates mentioned.
27/12/23, 6:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that you have financial concerns and feel that the cost of education and registration fees shared with you is quite high. However, when pursuing higher education abroad, the average cost of education for someone pursuing a degree in Law is $6000-$8000, whereas MVN University has provided you with a 90% scholarship, after which your cost of education is only $1600. Compared to the cost of education, this is the best opportunity for Mickelly to pursue a degree in Law. It's a five-year degree, and the competition is high, this is one of the best opportunity that can help Mickelly get such a high quantum of scholarship with such an affordable cost of education.
27/12/23, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you want to wait for other offer letters, you will definitely get more offer letters, although the cost of education for those universities would be quite higher than what has been offered by MVN University. Before we started your admission journey, I had a conversation with your counselor on a personal level, and he mentioned that you are working as a civil servant, and dedicated to send your child abroad to get the quality of higher education is quite commendable. Hence, he recommended that we process Mickelly's application for a higher quantum of scholarship.
27/12/23, 6:10 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Are we not allowed to select or have our own choice comparing the figures of universities because you said this is the first university .Why can't we wait for other responds from different universities .As a parent l have got the right to choose and consider which university can l afford.
27/12/23, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are absolutely right that you have the freedom to choose the university, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
27/12/23, 6:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
27/12/23, 6:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
27/12/23, 6:19 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I understand because l can't beat their deadline unless God perfoms miracle of getting money for me
27/12/23, 6:21 PM - +263 77 149 9307: That is the reason why  l was appealing for your understand to facilitate the upcoming of other universities may be l can meet the dead line
27/12/23, 6:23 PM - +263 77 149 9307: If l manage to get that $100 before 3rd of January then it will be fine l can proceed the registration process with MVN
27/12/23, 6:24 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Failure to meet 3rd of January then we can wait for other universities
27/12/23, 6:29 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I can't still remember the name of the university which was saying $1200 per year .Mickelly is not reachable will ask her.Unfortunately things were not well financially within the family .She could have enrolled with that university .
27/12/23, 6:31 PM - +263 77 149 9307: With the Edoofa programme it was fine  since Earn while you learn will cover part of the fee.
27/12/23, 6:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 I do understand your situation, and would do my best to assist you with the current situation. As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN University, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN University and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
27/12/23, 7:12 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Do you mean to say MVN is the only university which give scholarship ? There are other students from Zimbabwe who were given 100 percent scholarship but they were not enrolled with Edoofa so if I miss this opportunity so l hope there are other opportunities to come in life because we can't say MVN is the only university which offers scholarships ,l don't think so .
27/12/23, 7:13 PM - +263 77 149 9307: We can try some universities not MVN only
27/12/23, 7:14 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I'm not aware of the transfere options
27/12/23, 7:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are absolutely right, MVN University is not the only university who gives scholarship to the students, although this is one of the university which gives higher quantum of scholarship to the deserving students like Mickelly. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN University by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN University without risking losing out on the scholarship.
27/12/23, 7:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN University to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN University , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
27/12/23, 7:21 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes but I'm not willing to strictly stick to MVN let's try other universities and compare ,I don't think it's a high quantum of scholarship if someone is paying $1600 per year .What about those who just find money for air ticket and visa only and the rest will be covered by university ,that's hiqh quantum and 100 percent scholarship.
27/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I doubt very much if it's 90 percent whilst paying almost full payments of other university
27/12/23, 7:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I respect your thoughts @263771499307, If you don't mind May I know which university are your referring here please?
27/12/23, 7:29 PM - +263 77 149 9307: If you calculate enrolment fee and registration fee it's about $2000 so can we call this a scholarship ? It's unbearable because all this money is coming from 1 pocket .
27/12/23, 7:30 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I will confirm the names of these university from the students who were offered scholarships in India
27/12/23, 7:31 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Some have already started their studies in July and some in August this year
27/12/23, 7:36 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Even in America if they say it's a scholarship there is a great difference on the amount to be paid by the parent
27/12/23, 11:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. I was occupied with a meeting which was then accompanied by my dinner break, I would love to answer your concern and move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
28/12/23, 6:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mickelly, I hope you are doing well. 

Regarding our today's discussion, I would like to share that we will start our discussion today at 8:00pm as I have an urgent meeting at the current moment. I hope you will be available at 8:00 for the discussion.
30/12/23, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Mickelly,

As we approach the end of the year, I want to take a moment to reflect on all that we have accomplished together. Despite the challenges you faced, you persevered and continued to learn and grow. I am so proud of you for your hard work and dedication towards your Higher Education. 

As we look ahead to the new year, I want to wish you all a very happy and healthy 2024. May this year bring you joy, success, and fulfillment in all that you do. May you continue to learn and grow, and may you never lose your passion for knowledge and discovery.
30/12/23, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, as you embark on new adventures please know that I am here to support you every step of the way. I would like to connect with you on Tuesday at 2:00 pm for the further discussion.  I look forward to continuing our journey together in the new year. Let us make 2024 a year of growth, learning, and discovery. 

Please confirm if this time is convenient for you. In the event that you are unavailable at this specific time, kindly provide your availability between 2:00 PM and 7:00 PM, and we can coordinate to schedule our session accordingly.
30/12/23, 2:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents, and Mickelly,

I hope you are doing well, and I find you in the best of spirits. With regards to our messages last week, we wanted to connect with you today at 02:00 PM, and since we are at the scheduled time, I wanted to reach out to you and inquire if you are available for a brief discussion about your higher education.
2/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Just like us, I hope you and your family must have had a wonderful and blessed New Year. With all the positive things unfolding around us, I wanted to connect with you, help you with the concerns you shared earlier, and ensure you are able to complete your university admission process before losing out on this scholarship opportunity. Hence, could you please help me confirm your availability?
2/1/24, 2:19 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Good afternoon
2/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon to you as well, @263771499307. Wishing you a very Happy New Year. May I know if you were able to go through my above message, and if you are available, I would like to have a brief discussion about your university admission process, and move forward from where we left for your higher educational plan?
2/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes l have gone through the messages
2/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that, @263771499307, and I appreciate your availability for our discussion. Regarding our conversation the other day, you highlighted a few concerns regarding the Scholarship Program and the cost of education. Over the New Year's week, I had the opportunity to go through your scholarship application file, engage in a conversation with your career counselor, and consult the academic board as well.
2/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, our discussion left me a bit confused since the details of the scholarship and the cost of education were shared with you early on. With the recent conversation, you mentioned that the cost is a bit much for you, and you questioned how the scholarship is helping you. 

This, in turn, left a negative impression on your scholarship application. Hence, I wanted to reach out to you and ask for your help to understand your concerns better. This will enable us to see if there is still an opportunity for you to pursue your education affordably. Can you assist me with this?
2/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 149 9307: My concerns is on the other fees because they only give 90 percent on tuition fee and hostel fee only so all other figures were written as full payments without scholarship
2/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yet if l am appealing for help it means lm having difficulties in my life to get that money not that l have a negative impression on the scholarship . I was expecting it to cover three quarters of the whole fees
2/1/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your perspective, @263771499307, but I am struggling a but to fully grasp your concerns. During your introduction to the Edoofa Scholarship Program and counseling sessions, you were informed that the typical cost of education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000. 

If you were found eligible for the the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you will be assured a scholarship ranging from 50% to 100% on your tuition fees. Consequently, this would bring down your overall cost of education to a range between $2000 to $3000 annually, covering various components such as:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Accommodation Cost
3. Cost of Food
4. Other University Basic Expenses
2/1/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The reason I am finding a challenge in understanding your concerns arises from the fact that, with the grace of God, you successfully secured a 90% scholarship on your tuition fee and a 100% scholarship on the accommodation fee. 

This remarkable opportunity has significantly reduced your annual cost of education to $185 and it not only includes your Tuition Fee, but also your living cost, library fee, examination fee, EDB and Book Bank cost, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill. Is my understanding not correct here @263771499307?
2/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 77 149 9307: That number 4 MVN is not covering
2/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 77 149 9307: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I don't know may the way l understand this type of schoarship it's different from what is being offered with MVN
2/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 77 149 9307: *Maybe
2/1/24, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307, I believe there might be a misunderstanding regarding the offer letter in your case. 

As we discussed during our recent conversation about the offer letter you received, we highlighted that your annual cost of education is $1600, and this is explicitly mentioned in the offer letter. 

If you refer to this cost of $1600, you will notice that it falls below the expected range of $2000 to $3000 that was initially communicated to you. <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I'm still struggling to get the admission fee and the dead line it's tomorrow so l don't know how best are you going to help me .
2/1/24, 3:18 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Like that sport fee is it necessary .
2/1/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307, if that is the case, I would encourage you to help me understand your perspective. From my standpoint, not only have all the promises made to you been kept, but you have also been provided with additional opportunities, resulting in a significantly lower cost of education than originally you were expecting.
2/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Our willingness to go the extra mile stems from our awareness of your family background. I personally had a conversation with your counselor, who outlined the challenges your family has. Our goal has been to secure the most affordable option for you, leading to the opportunity you have gained at MVN University.
2/1/24, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, your expressed concerns the other day left me somewhat disappointed. You mentioned challenges with the registration fee deadline and needed assistance, yet questioned how the scholarship has benefited you. While we have consistently assisted our students in overcoming challenges, it becomes challenging if a student fails to recognize the importance of the scholarship as a crucial stepping stone in their academic and career journey.
2/1/24, 3:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the academic intake of August 2024, 354 scholarship seats have already been occupied from Zimbabwe. I am sure you understand that time is of the essence, and as such, we have a limited window to assist you and your family before you potentially miss out on this valuable opportunity.

At this juncture, I would like to ask you a question: could you help me recall why you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program and why you planned to pursue your education abroad instead of in Zimbabwe? <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 149 9307: May this question is for Mickelly because she is the one who enrolled with Edoofa
2/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I as a parent l just joined after she qualifies to enroll with Edoofa
2/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, @263771499307. Mickelly can indeed provide insights into this question. As a parent, the education of our children holds a significant place. While they make decisions about their careers, we, as parents, stand by them, offer support, and guide them toward the right choices. I believe you share a similar perspective, and as a responsible parent, you've been an integral part of Mickelly's educational journey, actively involved in guiding and supporting their choices. Is that a fair understanding?
2/1/24, 3:37 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes it's a fair understanding
2/1/24, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Right, @263771499307. Considering the crucial role you play in Mickelly's education, it's evident that you want the very best for her. The Scholarship Opportunity has indeed opened doors for Mickelly to access high-quality education abroad in the field she wishes to pursue, and remarkably, at a cost even lower than what you would pay for her education in Zimbabwe.
2/1/24, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In Zimbabwe, pursuing a law degree requires achieving 15 points in A Level, and even then, the cost of education is roughly $2000 per annum. Moreover, considering that Zimbabwe's education system lags behind India by 10 years, the investment made there might not yield the desired results for her career. I assume, like many parents, this is one of the reasons you supported Mickelly's enrollment in the scholarship program and aligned your preparations for her education in India?
2/1/24, 3:45 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I support everything you say
2/1/24, 3:47 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Everything you say is correct
2/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to see that we share a mutual understanding, @263771499307. From our discussions, it's clear that the opportunity presented to Mickelly is unique, and your primary motivation for her to pursue education abroad is rooted in the quest for better educational prospects. 

The only current concern revolves around the finances for the registration fee, not the scholarship program, as the promised benefits have been delivered. Can I safely establish this understanding so that we can address the financial challenge you're facing?
2/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes the problem is the financial challenges
2/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for aligning our perspectives, @263771499307. I am well aware of the economic challenges your country is facing and how it has affected the financial situations of families. However, despite these challenges, students have successfully planned their finances and secured scholarship seats with universities, aiming to access a higher quality of education. This unfortunate situation in Zimbabwe often hinders academic growth, which has forced students to explore alternatives abroad.
2/1/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In consideration of this, I personally engaged in a conversation with the academic board to address your financial concerns and as shared with you the other day, I helped you with a flexible payment plan, allowing you to retain the Endowment Benefits offered while making a reduced payment of $900 toward your fee. This can be managed as follows:

1. First Installment of $100 by 3rd January 2023.
2. Second Installment of $350 by the 30th January 2023.
3. Last and final installment of $450 by the 29th February 2023.
2/1/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this arrangement, @263771499307, you have a bit more flexibility, which helps alleviate the immediate financial burden, allowing Mickelly to proceed with her admission and education smoothly. Considering this, all you need to do is make a payment of $100 tomorrow. Since you've been preparing for this over the past couple of weeks, I trust you would have been able to set aside the same amount? <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Im putting my effort but the truth is lm still running around to find the money
2/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, @263771499307. I appreciate your dedication to ensuring Mickelly has access to better opportunities for her future. 

If you don't mind sharing, may I know how you have been preparing for the payment of $100, considering the deadline is tomorrow and time is limited? This information will help me better understand the situation and explore potential solutions or alternatives if needed. <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Money it's a problem it's not an issue of the time period l was given
2/1/24, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hear you @263771499307  and hence I am eager to gain a better understanding. Could you please help me understand how are you currently preparing for Mickelly's educational finances?
2/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I rely with the monthly salary only ,l don't have any other sources of income
2/1/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Okay, @263771499307. If I may ask, could you share by what dates you usually receive your salary for the month? If I'm correct, most employees receive their salary between the 25th and 5th of every month. <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Yes that's correct
2/1/24, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, @263771499307, with this information, may I know if you have already received your salary for the month of December or if you are planning to receive it before the 5th of January?
2/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 149 9307: December was already used to pay fees for Mickelly 's siblings
2/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 149 9307: December salary
2/1/24, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand, @263771499307, and I acknowledge that the payments for your other children were important. However, if I am understanding correctly, it seems you must have received your salary within the past week. Knowing about the payment plan discussed earlier, which required setting aside at least $100 to secure Mickelly's scholarship seat, may I inquire why dud you not set this amount aside?
2/1/24, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The only reason I am concerned here is that if your salary has been utilized and the funds for Mickelly's fee tomorrow have not been set aside, she could lose out on her scholarship opportunity. Even if we manage to help her secure it later, she might miss out on the Endowment Benefits, and there's uncertainty about whether she can secure the same scholarship again. Are you able to see our concerns here?
2/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 149 9307: If you were Mickelly mother how were you going to budget $300 for four children
2/1/24, 4:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307, over the past couple of weeks, I am sure you realize that I have dedicated an hour each day to engage in personal conversations with you, aiming to understand your position and provide solutions to ensure your child's career is on the right path.
2/1/24, 4:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I acknowledge that each individual's circumstances are unique, and I fully respect the challenges you have be facing and hence my primary goal is to assist you in navigating through the financial planning process for Mickelly's education, through my experience in successfully guiding numerous students through similar challenges.
2/1/24, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If I were in a similar position and encountered a challenge like this, my preferred approach would be to initiate an open and transparent conversation with Mickelly's admission officer. This would entail sharing the exact concerns I have and exploring potential solutions.
2/1/24, 4:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the same note, in our previous conversation, you conveyed your ability to set aside $100 for Mickelly's education and that is what we were hoping you would have done. However ma'am, it appears that your plans may have shifted since our discussion and you did not discuss with us before making the same move. Hence, I am not certain how you wish me to help you out in secureing Mickelly's scholarship seat  in this situation?
2/1/24, 5:11 PM - +263 77 149 9307: That question l gave you means 1 months salary can not solve the problem of the whole family but we try to squeez .I never mentioned about saving $100 for Mickelly on December salary but l was looking for institutes or companies or individuals who can loan me .January salary that's definite we are budgeting for Mickelly .
2/1/24, 7:49 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I have the challenge at the bank ,they are saying the account should have the same name of the university .May you clarify how are we going to do it.
2/1/24, 7:51 PM - +263 77 149 9307: May l have account number of the university
2/1/24, 8:00 PM - +263 77 149 9307: I want something which is legite .I want an account with the name of the university ,this account is of an agent
2/1/24, 8:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delayed response, I was engaged in a meeting and couldn't check your message earlier. Addressing your messages, @263771499307, I understand that your problems cannot be solved within a month.
2/1/24, 8:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, Ma'am, I am sure you realize that planning for your child to pursue education abroad requires significant preparation time. Students and families plan for this years in advance. In your case, you have made the decision for Mickelly to join the August 2024 intake, providing us with a good 8 months to prepare for your child's finances.
2/1/24, 8:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: While you may have started a bit late, there is still sufficient time to prepare for your child's finances. All you need to do is make the right decisions for your child. Ma'am, 

I believe this begins with aligning your finances with the timeline. Considering the constraints you have mentioned, we have taken an extra step to assist you and shared a flexible payment plan. Instead of paying the entire fee of $450 now, you only have to pay $100, and the rest can be paid according to the extended deadlines.
2/1/24, 8:35 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Ok ,what about the bank details of the MVN university
2/1/24, 8:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Surely @263771499307. I trust that you are working towards meeting the same commitments. Regarding the account details mentioned in the offer letter, they are not of the agent, instead, the details mentioned belong to Anhad Edutrain Private Solutions Limited, the parent company of Edoofa.
2/1/24, 8:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Edoofa is the educational partner of all the universities associated with it, and hence Edoofa is authorized to receive all the fee payments while a student is in their home country. The reason is quite simple: when a student is in their home country, they cannot take the responsibility of tracing the payment made by the student to India, and hence the same responsibility is taken by Edoofa since we are physically here and can get the payment confirmations easily.
2/1/24, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Therefore, all the students route their payment of their registration fee through Edoofa while they are in their home country since it is the most convenient and trusted mode of payment. Once they are in India, then it is up to them if they wish to make the payment through Edoofa or directly to the university.
2/1/24, 8:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Also, the registration fee is paid into Edoofa's account, ensuring that if a student wishes to change their college in the future, it can be done easily. This is the reason the university itself mentions that the payment should be made to Edoofa's account, and if you need an invoice to submit at the bank for the payment, the same can easily be requested from the accounts team. Are you clear with this?
3/1/24, 12:20 PM - +263 77 149 9307: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mickelly, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
3/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 149 9307: Thank you
3/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263771499307, Have a good day ahead!
