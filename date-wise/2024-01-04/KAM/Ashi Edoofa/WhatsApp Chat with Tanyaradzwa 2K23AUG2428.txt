20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer

2/1/24, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263718984704, How are you doing?

2/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 71 898 4704: And you Ms Ashi?
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine, thank you. May I know if you remember the conversation you had with Mr. Shivjeet about your university admission ?
2/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 71 898 4704: Mm its been a while so I don't remember. Also those days i was still writing exams so I wasn't active on whatsapp
2/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem dear, Let's start from the beginning. Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Computer Science)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
2/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 898 4704: Yes mam it is
2/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation dear, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
2/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
2/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
2/1/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
2/1/24, 9:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As I am waiting for your response dear, Please do let me know what are your thoughts. However, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
