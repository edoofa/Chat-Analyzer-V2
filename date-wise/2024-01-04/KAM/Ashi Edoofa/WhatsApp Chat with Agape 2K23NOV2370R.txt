However, if everything appears to be in order, please confirm that you have received and acknowledged the provided information.
3/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Name of Student: Agape Munkuli
University Name: MVN University

Registration Fee Due: $1000
Endowment Grant: $100
Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $1000 - $100 = $900

Payment Mode Used:  Mukuru to Mr. Rajan
International Transfer Charges: $63 (7% of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $900 + $63 = $963

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $514 (Paid on 27-Dec-2023, 28-Dec-2023)

Balance Amount Due: $963 - $514 = $449

As per the payment plan shared by the university, the remaining balance of $449 is to be paid on or before the due date of *28th January 2024*. It's worth noting that the earlier you make this payment, the sooner you'll be able to complete your university admission process.
3/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 78 036 3800: Okay thank you to hear that 

But i had hoped to first wait for the Galgotias first
3/1/24, 12:55 PM - +263 78 036 3800: Then we can make an informed decision on the university which has gave me place such as mvn 

For now we haven't confirmed it as the rightful university for us 

Considering that it is not one of the best in terms of rankings and it's location
3/1/24, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263780363800. I understand that you are looking forward for the offer letter from Galgotias University. However, I am not able to understand your concern about the MVN University about it's ranking and location. If you don't mind, could you please let me know your thoughts?
3/1/24, 12:58 PM - +263 78 036 3800: I heard that it is located in the semi urban city
3/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 78 036 3800: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Agape,  I completely understand the importance of choosing the right university for your education, and I appreciate the effort you have put into researching about MVN University. 

Your commitment to ensuring a good university for yourself is commendable. Hence, I would like to address your concerns and offer some guidance. I am sure you must be aware that there are different ranking bodies in India and when you research university rankings and reviews, it's crucial to consider reliable sources such as official university websites, reputable education portals, and recognized ranking platforms.
3/1/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: MVN University is one of the prestigious universities located in Delhi NCR, India. Established in 2012 under the Haryana Private Universities Act, it has quickly become a renowned educational hub in the region.

3/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 78 036 3800: But wat about its rankings
3/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 78 036 3800: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 78 036 3800: Thank you but I would have loved if I get one at Galgotias because of many reasons such as 
1 highly ranked compared to mvn
2 all of the students I know that are in India are there
3 it's in a bit city with more things to learn about India compared to while at mvn
3/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263780363800 Dear,  I respect your choice and as we have mentioned earlier that we have already submitted your application at Galgotias University. While it's important for you to have the right information. While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.

To provide you with accurate information, MVN University is one of the leading universities in the *Delhi NCR*, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for you after careful consideration. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring the wrong place, and thus these concerns were highlighted.
3/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, being Indians, we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them. With this, you can rest assured that the quality of the university would be up to the mark and would be the right fit for Progress.
