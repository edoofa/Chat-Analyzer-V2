20/12/23, 5:56 PM - +263 78 363 5917: But at first  yu said galgotias
20/12/23, 5:56 PM - +263 78 363 5917: Is there a change on the university
20/12/23, 6:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening @263783635917
20/12/23, 6:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
20/12/23, 6:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them.
20/12/23, 6:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/12/23, 7:15 PM - +263 78 363 5917: Yeah it's very clear
20/12/23, 7:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias University without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/12/23, 7:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias University to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750 .

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750 , but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias University , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/12/23, 7:21 PM - +263 78 363 5917: Yes so when is lovely profession university  will accept

20/12/23, 8:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would like to share that the accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. Also, in terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as it is very near to the university. It will be either walking distance or local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 every month.
20/12/23, 8:44 PM - +263 78 363 5917: What about food
20/12/23, 8:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you are opting for off campus accommodation, in that case, you have the opportunity to cook your own food at your accommodation, which means you have the liberty to eat your home-cooked meals. It will cost the students a monthly expense of $40 to $50 to gather groceries or even sometimes order food from outside the university, giving you affordability and convenience too. I hope I am clear on this?
20/12/23, 8:48 PM - +263 78 363 5917: Okay there  are no people who cater for food on off campus
