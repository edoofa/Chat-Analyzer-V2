I was going through our conversation the past couple of days and noticed that we have experienced unresponsiveness from your side and hence there has been no progress with respect to the process. 

To ensure a smoother interaction, I wanted to reach out and schedule a discussion for tomorrow to address the any question or concern you have. Hence, could you please share your availability today from 01:00 pm to 07:00 pm, I will do my best to accommodate our conversation accordingly.

Since your due date was yesterday, I am reaching out to you to understand the current situation so that I can update the university officials accordingly.
29/12/23, 11:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: It seems that my earlier messages have not been able to get through, I believe something has been bothering you because of which you have not been able to get back to us. Is my understanding right here?
29/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 78 791 3093: I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a change in my plans regarding the offer I received as Tanatswa Kaniwa. Recently, I was fortunate enough to be awarded a scholarship by the Zimbabwe government, which I have decided to accept. As a result, I will not be taking up the offer previously extended to me.

In light of this development, I kindly request guidance on the process for obtaining a refund of the enrolment fee that I had paid. I would appreciate any assistance you can provide in facilitating this process.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and am grateful for the opportunity you offered.
