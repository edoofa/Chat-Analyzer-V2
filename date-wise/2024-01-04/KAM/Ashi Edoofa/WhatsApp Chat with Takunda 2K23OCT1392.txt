I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *LPU University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
20/12/23, 9:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions.

20/12/23, 9:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 8:58 AM - +263 73 290 9611: Good morning to you Admission Officer 

I am so delighted with the Offer letter, yes I'll be available at 3:00pm
21/12/23, 11:36 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263732909611, Let us plan to reconnect in the afternoon at 03:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion. 

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete LPU university admission formalities.
21/12/23, 11:40 AM - +263 73 290 9611: That is well noted thank you
21/12/23, 11:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263732909611
21/12/23, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takunda ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
21/12/23, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
21/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 73 290 9611: That is well noted good Afternoon
21/12/23, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
21/12/23, 3:07 PM - +263 73 290 9611: 1. $975
2. 3years 
3. $700
21/12/23, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263732909611 The Admission Processing Fee is $200 and Registration fee is $700 please.
21/12/23, 3:12 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Yes i agree thank you
21/12/23, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
21/12/23, 3:15 PM - +263 73 290 9611: That is clear thank you
21/12/23, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263732909611, Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
21/12/23, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
21/12/23, 3:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
21/12/23, 3:20 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Thank you for informing I ma following
21/12/23, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
21/12/23, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and they would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 3:24 PM - +263 73 290 9611: I am very clear thank you
21/12/23, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome @263732909611, You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
21/12/23, 3:28 PM - +263 73 290 9611: I am clear thank you
21/12/23, 3:28 PM - +263 73 290 9611: I am following
21/12/23, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 3rd, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
21/12/23, 3:35 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Yes we are together
21/12/23, 3:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Yes you can exonerate
21/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of January 3rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of February 3rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before *January 3rd, 2024* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 3:43 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Yes that is well noted
21/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Yes I live in Harare
21/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/12/23, 3:49 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Thank you for sharing
21/12/23, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/12/23, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
21/12/23, 3:53 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Yes you can share
21/12/23, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/12/23, 4:01 PM - +263 73 290 9611: That is well noted
21/12/23, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263732909611, Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/12/23, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/12/23, 4:07 PM - +263 73 290 9611: I am clear
21/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/12/23, 4:18 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Yes, I would like to know how much  does it range ,  costs when I decide to stay off campus
21/12/23, 4:20 PM - +263 73 290 9611: After paying the $550 , how much will I have left altogether?
21/12/23, 4:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that the cost of accommodation for off-campus is $1000 including the food cost.
21/12/23, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After the scholarship, your per annum tuition fee is $1950. Once you pay the registration fees which is $550, then the amount left for your first year tuition fees will be $1950 - $550  = $1400.
21/12/23, 4:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope that's clear?
21/12/23, 4:25 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Oh alright
21/12/23, 4:27 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Again, it is mentioned that I have to submit my final results before 31 December 

Madam my results will be out during mid January to early February
21/12/23, 4:29 PM - +263 73 290 9611: That is clear madam thank you
21/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, That will be shared with the officials accordingly, Kindly don't worry about that please
21/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Is there anything else you would like to ask?
21/12/23, 4:41 PM - +263 73 290 9611: Thank you
21/12/23, 4:43 PM - +263 73 290 9611: As of now I do not have any questions but will you please allow me to ask if I have any in future
21/12/23, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Definitely dear, Always feel free to ask your queries with me, I will be more than happy to assist you.
21/12/23, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
21/12/23, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
21/12/23, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

21/12/23, 4:47 PM - +263 73 290 9611: That is well noted
21/12/23, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by Saturday at 12:00 pm and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
21/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 73 290 9611: That is well noted thanks
21/12/23, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

28/12/23, 3:32 PM - +263 73 290 9611: A blessed afternoon to you Admission Officer.

I hereby as a part of the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship program has to share with you the following; Madam due to circumstances I am not able to go any further with the journey of Higher Education with Edoofa. This has been influenced by the dismissal of my sponsor who is my dad from work. 

From both my perspective and your own point of view I had been a young man who had objectives in life and was willing to give my 100% on my journey. However I am disappointed that my father is out of work and this marks the end of my journey with Edoofa as no one can make the payment plans for me to acquire knowledge in India.

Due to this disastrous consequence  my family has asked and is kindly asking to refund back the $388 which we had already paid when my dad was working so that we can be able to continue life for the time being having basic needs for instance, food and clothes.

Thank you I really appreciate how we used to connect and interact effectively.
28/12/23, 10:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening @263732909611, I hope you are doing well.
