17/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes I still remember them
17/10/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please. I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 973 3476: On the registration process she had to answer some questions that you assigned her. Then you were to forward to different universities her am no longer sure if it's Statement of purpose🤦‍♂️from there you said you would send us different university offer letters for  us to choose and pay registration fees for reservations of her seat
17/10/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 973 3476: The registration fees is to be paid either in two batches or can be once off
17/10/23, 5:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
17/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 973 3476: No not at the moment
17/10/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
17/10/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
17/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Thank you. At least a can sigh with relief. Had thought maybe it's no longer coming.
17/10/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Am grateful for this offer and it's my prayer that she will not disappoint us both you and the family.
17/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Have heard from some of the students whom you enrolled that you are seriously when in comes to education and manges to have a glimpse of one of the student's timetable
17/10/23, 5:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I appreciate your gratitude and prayers. We are dedicated to supporting students in their educational journeys and ensuring they have a bright future.
17/10/23, 5:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
17/10/23, 5:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 5:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
17/10/23, 5:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
17/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Am done reviewing the benefits
17/10/23, 5:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 5:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 5:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Alison, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Following
17/10/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes thank you for this benefit
17/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 973 3476: This is extremely awesome. Thank you
17/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 973 3476: It is clear
17/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 973 3476: May you provide more information on this
17/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
17/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes it's now clear
17/10/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
17/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes it's true
17/10/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 973 3476: I believe the first 2 are okay. Giving up on education uuh it's not good.
17/10/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, however, it is our responsibility to provide what the students have chosen for themselves. 

 Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Noted
17/10/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Following
17/10/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Noted but well I just think one is to work hard either go for re-appearing for A level or go for the diploma. If it happens that there is no hope at all well it will be the last option to stop.
17/10/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are correct. I am sure Alison is going to make you proud and this situation is not going to occur at all. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Am just praying for the best and that she passes her A  level
17/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes it's clear
17/10/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Alison's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Alison is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes and am looking forward to that
17/10/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
17/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Thank you. Noted
17/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Good day
02/11/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Alison,

Furthermore, they have chosen to extend a scholarship offer to you.
02/11/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

03/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Afternoon. Noted.
03/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you again.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Greetings to you
03/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Was really happy when we received the offer letter
03/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Had been eagerly waiting for it
03/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes I managed to go through the offer letter so we can discuss on it
03/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are so excited about the offer letter, I can clearly see your enthusiasm and I am happy to know that you were able to go through the offer letter. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
03/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Noted it's fine
03/11/23, 6:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from *Galgotias University*. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
03/11/23, 6:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 973 3476: 1) Tuition fee after the scholarship is$900 per semester
2)Standard duration of the course is 5years
3) Admission and procedure fee is $300
4)$750 registration fee
03/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
03/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes
03/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. I am pleased that we've been able to make progress and are clear so far. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
03/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Following
03/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 973 3476: What do you mean by 3 seater
03/11/23, 6:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you explain @263779733476 by 3 seater we mean a room which would be shared by 3 students. May I know if you are clear now?
03/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 973 3476: It is clear now. Thank you
03/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
03/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Noted
03/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
03/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 973 3476: It's clear
03/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
03/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
03/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Following. So we are to pay 750 only
03/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Noted
03/11/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a *$150 grant* applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
03/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 973 3476: May you explain once again maybe am on the wrong side
03/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
03/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
03/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Noted thank you
03/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 973 3476: True it's flexible
03/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Noted
03/11/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Indeed we have curated these payment plans so that they can be flexible for you. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/11/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Am residing in Harare
03/11/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/11/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/11/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Noted Thank you
03/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 973 3476: So do we get to sign somewhere for proof that we have given him the payment
03/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
03/11/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charle's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
03/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Noted
03/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes you can though would rather go to Mr Rajan for the less percentage but in case I fail to get in touch with him would then use the FBC bank
03/11/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
03/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Thank you
03/11/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
03/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Thank you
03/11/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
03/11/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
03/11/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
03/11/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
03/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Following
03/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
03/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
03/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Am following unfortunately Alison is not online at the moment but she will read through when she is free
03/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. I am glad to know that she will be able to go through the conversation when she is available.
03/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes she will
03/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Alison will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education while balancing her academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
03/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Am also hoping for the same
03/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 973 3476: The questions that I had were answered during the discussion.
03/11/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have no queries so far. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

04/11/23, 9:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! That you are taking proactive steps like talking to one of your students. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
04/11/23, 9:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
04/11/23, 9:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.

04/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 973 3476: Thank you will get in touch with her
04/11/23, 9:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 16, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
04/11/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 973 3476: If all goes well will do the 600 once of but if we fail to raise all 600 before 16 then will go for the 300 but we are hoping for the 600 so that we reduce the costs on percentages
04/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 973 3476: Before 16 November
04/11/23, 9:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university.

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning Alison's offer letter. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
07/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Evening sorry network challenges
07/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 973 3476: We can discuss
07/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for making the time for our discussion despite the network troubles. I'll be here, so we can take the conversation at a pace that works with your connectivity. May I know if you are comfortable to proceed ahead?
07/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes we can proceed
07/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, now I would like to know if you were able to connect with Valerie, if yes I am curious to know about your discussion with her?
07/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Yes I managed to connect with her
07/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 973 3476: I asked her about studying in India and she told me that education in India is of high quality
07/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 973 3476: I also asked her about working in India and she told me that currently she is doing her masters and also as am intern at a certain company. That when one gets to India she would have gone there using Learning Visa not working visa so it's difficult to work there using the learning visa
07/11/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you were able to have a conversation with Valerie and thank you for sharing that, yes that is correct, since Valerie wanted to study more she never applied for a working Visa. If Alison wishes to continue with her masters in India she would also be on a learning visa, however, if she wishes to sit for a placement in her final year of college and gets placed in a good company the company that hires the students will help them getting the work visa please.
07/11/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now for your better understanding let me help you understand what Placements are:

After completing her studies in India she will be employable globally. As you may know, each university offers courses with varying durations. In Zimbabwe, it is referred to as *industrial attachment* or *work internships*. India refers to it as *" placements."* Every university affiliated with the Edoofa Program has its own dedicated placement cell. Their primary mission is to ensure that all students secure placements in their pre-final year of education.
07/11/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When students reach their pre-final year, they participate in placement drives conducted by various multinational corporations, startups, and organizations. During these drives, students go through interviews, and if they demonstrate proficiency, they end up receiving job offers from these companies. Depending on the job offer, students have the option to apply for a work permit that allows them to extend their stay in India for the duration of their employment.
07/11/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moreover, the EWYL program for you is specifically designed so that you as a student are able to learn the 21st-century skills which are certainly required for every student to be employable ready. Through EWYL you will boost your confidence which is going to help you in the future and with the skills learned you will definitely be employable ready. It depends upon the student how much they are willing to learn from the program.

I hope you have a better understanding now?
07/11/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 973 3476: Really that's good news indeed
