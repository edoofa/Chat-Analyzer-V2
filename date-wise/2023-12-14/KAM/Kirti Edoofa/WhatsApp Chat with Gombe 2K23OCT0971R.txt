I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Let's start
01/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Downloading
01/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Am. done
01/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Okay
01/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Alright
01/11/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/11/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Should I ask a question that, are all the steps done before A level results are out?
01/11/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as we will move step by step everything will be clear to you.
01/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 932 0751: So far so good and the process wonderful it seems the Students will be in good hands
01/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words. I really appreciate that. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Let's do only step 1 for I have to be at home by 3 to do my updates
01/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please if you recall the admission cycle the message from the founders is step 1 only and we have not been proactive in the journey hence we are only at step 1 till now, other peers to Aisha have completed step 4. I hope you understand why I always keep saying that we need to be proactive, please?
01/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Noted ma'm
01/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
01/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?

04/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings everyone .Maam Kirt  ,well i have managed to go through the videos and audios so here is the summary of my understanding:
 *From* *video* *1*
Message for enrolled students there are 2 key points to be noted that include 1- following instruction and 2- a student should be open minded and teachable
 *Video* *2*
It's all about how some students have managed it through the Edoofa scholarship program 
Also agood attitude is expected from students so as to have capacity to win sucess
 *Video* *3*
Its about the colleges and universities under Edoofa
The founders have managed to discover some challenges that were being faced by students and they had found solutions in the ten year course of foundation
In this video it also signified that a lot of time had been invested to convience some colleges and universities to give seats for scholarship for Edoofians.
Edoofa focuses on high quality education , life skills and attitude will bring an Edoofian a necessary training and will pass with flying colours.
 *Video* *4* 
Here its all about th Statement of Purpose (SOP) - this is the only subjective document that gives an opportunity to any student to convince the admission board.
This statement should include the student's vision toward the particular course they want to undertake,the academic progress and also the student's strengths.
The admission team will give the student a form and  indicate the amount of time to invest on the form.
Overally the SOP is an important document , students should be prompt in taking action and be deligent in filling out the form.
04/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 71 951 6687: May you kindly assist if there are some areas that i didn't understand
06/11/23, 11:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded it was past our available hours for Saturday so we were not able to connect with you. I would like to inquire if you will be available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 932 0751: This message was deleted
06/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Afternoon everyone. We can comnect
06/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Due to network services Aisha is currently using this phone for now
06/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. That is aright please, thank you for sharing your understanding Aisha. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
06/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

08/11/23, 8:34 am - +263 77 932 0751: Yes ma'am
08/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 951 6687: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _Ms Ananya_ and she has scheduled my session for __Monday to Friday 1:30PM to 2:30 PM_"
08/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings maam im now answering the academic qsns
08/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Below are the answers
08/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 951 6687: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 951 6687: *Relationship* *between* *Entrepreneurship* *and* *economic* *development*: Entrepreneurship is often considered to be a key driver of economic development. This is because entrepreneurs create new businesses, which in turn create jobs and generate wealth. In addition, entrepreneurs tend to be innovators who develop new products and services that can improve the standard of living for society as a whole. So you see, there is a strong link between entrepreneurship and economic development.
08/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 951 6687: *Understanding* *of* *GAAP* *and* *its* *importance* :
GAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, are a set of guidelines and rules that govern how companies prepare their financial statements. They're important because they help to ensure that financial statements are consistent, reliable, and easy to understand. They also help to prevent companies from manipulating their numbers to look more profitable than they actually are. By following GAAP, companies can provide investors and other stakeholders with an accurate picture of their financial health.
So you see, by following GAAP, companies can give investors and other stakeholders the information they need to make informed decisions about their investments. Without GAAP, it would be much harder
08/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 951 6687: *What* *are* *Accounting* *standards* *and* *why* *are* *they* *mandatory* ? Accounting standards, also called Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), are a set of rules and standards that govern the preparation of financial statements. They are designed to promote consistency and comparability of financial information, and to ensure that financial statements are prepared in a way that is transparent and understandable. GAAP are mandatory because they help to ensure that financial statements are prepared in a way that is accurate and reliable, and that investors and other users of financial statements can make informed decisions.
08/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 951 6687: *Difference* *between* *Accounting* *and* *Auditing* : accounting is the process of recording, classifying, and summarizing financial transactions, while auditing is the process of examining and verifying the accuracy of financial statements and records. Accounting deals with financial data, while auditing focuses on evaluating and providing an opinion on the accuracy of that data. In other words, accounting is about recording and processing the numbers, while auditing is about checking and verifying those numbers.
08/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Ananya. I appreciate you sharing the session time with us.

08/11/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know by when will you be able to share your identity proof?
08/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 951 6687: On Friday
08/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges, since it is just a picture of identity proof and students are able to share them within the same day?
08/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 951 6687: The identity is in Masvingo and i will go there tomorrow
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please you can share that by tomorrow. In the meantime may I know if you are available to connect with us?
08/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes ma'am we can connect
08/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
08/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Commerce, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
08/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes  exactly
08/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow this sounds awesome
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes specifically Accounting and fianance
08/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes I am ready to start
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes that's quite clear
08/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Thank you for sharing this information with me
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
08/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 951 6687: We haven't reached to that discussion yet but anyways that's great news to me
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, however, I am here referring to the counseling sessions that you had with your counselor and he must have informed the same?
08/11/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to reconnect again tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!

09/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings team team .Sorry ma'am for late responses my network has been tripping
09/11/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the identity proof, it is duly noted with us. That is alright, please I understand that the network can be a  challenge.
09/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Thank you for your understanding ma'am
09/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now I would like to inform you that we will not be available from the 10th of November to the 13th of November on the occasion of the biggest festivals coming up Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
09/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ok Maam thanks for informing
09/11/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and have a great day ahead.
09/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Thanks you I'm also wishing you the same
09/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, and thank you for your wishes.
14/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings..Hello can we connect if your holiday is over
14/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. Yes, please It was a great time with my family during the festival. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes that's nice to hear from you hope you had a blessed festival.we can connect
14/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, I had a blessed festival. I am glad to hear that we can connect now. May I know if you are clear so far?
14/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Clear in terms of what specifically
14/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: What I mean to ask is if you have any doubts so far?
14/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Well i only have a few questions ma'am can i ask
14/11/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please?
14/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Well is this scholarship fully funded or ...
14/11/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
14/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 951 6687: When is a student offered a100% scholarship
14/11/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When the student performs exceptionally well in his her A level along with the other factors mentioned above.
14/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ok thanks for clarifying
14/11/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
14/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Mmm can you explain further
14/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
14/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 951 6687: So does that mean i will be paying $1350 per annum
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
14/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow i can understand now
14/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
14/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow amazing
14/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 951 6687: No quiries
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
14/11/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow
14/11/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It was really heartwarming to meet them finally, I hope you are exited to be in this picture for next year batch as well?
14/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Exactly i can't wait
14/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see your enthusiasm. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
15/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings maam
15/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Can we connect
15/11/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Well we can connect
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
15/11/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
15/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ok well may you kindly further explain point 2
15/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
15/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students  A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
15/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Aisha, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
15/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow amazing🥳
15/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
15/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
15/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/11/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes ma'am that quite clear
15/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
15/11/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
15/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 951 6687: So does this mean that i will then be paying let's say on the example above ..i will be paying $900 in the whole first year
15/11/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please this is just the registration fee which is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
15/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Am i getting it or I'm lost ma'am
15/11/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 5:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
15/11/23, 5:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before November 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by December 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
15/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Well this is good to know and quite clear
15/11/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/11/23, 11:38 pm - +263 71 951 6687: May you kindly provide more information on this one
15/11/23, 11:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would have loved to, however, since our available hours for today are over we will be reconnecting with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm I hope you will be available to connect with us without any delays.
16/11/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Aisha,

I trust this message finds you in good health. Since we were unable to continue our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 951 6687: We can connect
16/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response earlier, however, I am not available to connect now, could you please confirm that you will be available tomorrow at 12:30 pm without delays?
17/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Greetings, can we connect
17/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes ma'am we can proceed
17/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 951 6687: My apologies for yesterday ma'am
17/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am
18/11/23, 7:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to the message above, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/11/23, 8:25 am - +263 77 932 0751: Morning ,we can connect now
18/11/23, 8:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
18/11/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 932 0751: Yes ma'am
18/11/23, 8:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 932 0751: May you kindly provide more information on this one
18/11/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/11/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/11/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/11/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/11/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 932 0751: Wow this is quite clear
18/11/23, 8:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 932 0751: Yeah is the any other options?
18/11/23, 8:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 932 0751: Ok
18/11/23, 9:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/11/23, 9:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 932 0751: Wow
18/11/23, 9:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
18/11/23, 9:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/11/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 932 0751: Noted
18/11/23, 9:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
20/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ok thank you for informing me .Have a blessed day
20/11/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.

28/11/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Yes I have seen the letter but my question now is the address of the bank is nowhere to be found in Zimbabwe so how do we make it
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779320751 majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
28/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Ok
28/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
28/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 932 0751: 1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? -$1000
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?-$1200
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’-$750
28/11/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1000

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
28/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Noted
28/11/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
28/11/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
28/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Noted wow
28/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill

These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that you will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
28/11/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Gombe.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not response since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 932 0751: Network is not stable
29/11/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779320751 that is alright please, I understand that network can be a challenge, so may I know if you are comfortable proceeding with the discussion now?
30/11/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gombe 

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
30/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Afternoon
30/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 951 6687: We can connect
30/11/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you are clear so far?
30/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 951 6687: From the offer letter above above i saw that there was uniform fee so may i ask if the students will be wearing uniforms
30/11/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me help you with your concern here. In some universities here in India there is a specific code that is followed. The dress code is created to instill a sense of solidarity in the students, furthermore, students are asked to wear formal attire so that they can learn to carry themselves well when they start their professional careers in the near future. I hope this is clear? <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ok thank you
30/11/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now that we have established the tuition fee at $1000 and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2200, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
30/11/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
01/12/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gombe 

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
01/12/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263719516687 @263779320751 I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
01/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 951 6687: We can proceed maam ..
01/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 951 6687: With the conversation
01/12/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. So may I know if you are clear so far?
01/12/23, 7:03 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Yes we are clear
01/12/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
01/12/23, 7:04 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ok
01/12/23, 7:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, he can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2200. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2200 - $1000 = $1200, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
01/12/23, 7:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous? <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 7:06 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Wow that's awesome
01/12/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
01/12/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ok
01/12/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2200 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after [name] arrives in India will be $2200 - $750 = $1450. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $725 and $725, with a six-month gap between them.
01/12/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
01/12/23, 7:11 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Clear
01/12/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 11th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
02/12/23, 8:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning to Parents and Aisha,

I trust you are in good health. I've been eagerly anticipating your response to my previous message. However, I understand that you may not have had the opportunity to reply just yet.

05/12/23, 7:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, let me help you understand why continuing Aisha's process for next year's intake is not a good idea. Because you will be losing on the Endowment benefits, meaning you will not be granted the $150 grant and the other 6 benefits we discussed above. That is the reason we were not suggesting the same to you. We understand how the endowment benefits come into play and help you out. With that said, let me also address the second alternative that you have suggested.
05/12/23, 7:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While taking a gap year may seem like it would provide you with enough time to prepare your finances, I am certain you might be able to do that, however, that might not be a viable solution for you, and that is the reason we did not suggest this to you in the first place.
05/12/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The reason being, that the universities revise the tuition fee every year, and by the time you start with Aisha's admission in 2025, that would further add to the financial pressure since the fee would be increased by at least 40%. As of now, the scholarship offer that Aisha has received is in accordance with 2023's fee structure, and as we move forward with the rounds of application, the fee for 2024 will be revised, adding to the financial burden for you and your family.

Secondly, when you factor in the economy of Zimbabwe I am sure you are aware that over the past few years, the economy has been in decline. By the next year, while you might be able to save up on expenses, these costs might factor in and once again add to your financial burden.
05/12/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, while we understand that you are the ones who are to make decisions for your child's higher education, we, as educators, have guided thousands of students every year to help them plan their admission process and higher education despite the financial challenges they face. Just like those students, ma'am, if you want us to help you out here, which is something we wish to do, I believe you have to take a step forward, understand the recommendations we have in place, and the basis of the same. If you are willing to work towards the solution, then we can certainly help you out.
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Well im comfortable with the 2025 intake despite any benefits that are to be lost or gainef.
05/12/23, 7:24 pm - +263 71 951 6687: *or gained
05/12/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I have taken note of what you have shared we shall discuss the same however, since it has been a long day for me, and it is past my available hours, I will be connecting with you on the 7th of December since I am not available tomorrow due to some personal work commitments, have a great evening ahead.
07/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 932 0751: Greetings team.                   Concerning my issue, there is no an other alterations/ options I should do beside withdrawing from the Edoofa program ___(why) because I feel it bad to burden other family members and friends by supporting me and my child.I am really hurt to the bones!  Assistance is there yes but as of now its shelter and food.  Empowering my child with education/ skills is my mission,I will make it one day!   Those helping have their own challenges and programs too , Zimbabwe is experiencing draught __most of us here are farmers who rely on the rains, for these and other reasons behind the scenes am withdrawing from the program with a paining heart    Kindly recognise Gombe 's application when she happens to do so in the coming year.         Thanks for your encouragement and wise advice .
07/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 932 0751: Well for the fees raiseup in the next year's and lose of program earnings,no problem  we will start from there
07/12/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Aisha,

I trust you are all in good health. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner, as I was engaged in a work meeting. Thank you for sharing your concerns with me, I have taken the time to carefully consider your message. I empathize with your situation and, if I were in your position, I believe I would feel similarly. However, as your admissions officer, it's important for me to assist you in seeing the broader perspective.

I recognize the challenges that come with financial constraints, especially as a single mother, and I understand the immense value you place on education. This, as I perceive, is the primary reason you chose to enroll with us, seeking a quality education for Aisha. Am I right in this understanding?
07/12/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Well I'm not getting you
07/12/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand better. As your admissions officer, it is my responsibility to assist you in seeing the broader perspective.

I recognize that with the current situation, your family faces and the financial challenges because of the house, and your mother being a single parent, I can understand how much she values education. This commitment of her to your education is precisely why she chose to enroll you with us, seeking a quality education for you. Am I right in this understanding?
07/12/23, 9:50 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Ya something like tha...
07/12/23, 9:52 pm - +263 71 951 6687: But due to the current circumstances we have to .. terminate this
07/12/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, Aisha, I completely comprehend that under the given circumstances, you might naturally lean towards the decision to withdraw from the scholarship. If this is the choice you've made, I fully respect your decision. However, there's still a question that is unanswered regarding the initial reasons behind your enrollment. When your mother enrolled you, she undoubtedly had specific aspirations or reasons in mind. If it's not too much to ask, could you kindly share with me what initially motivated you to pursue higher education in India?
07/12/23, 11:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. I wanted to let you know that I won't be available tomorrow due to a family wedding I'll be attending. Therefore, I'll be able to reconnect with you on December 9th. Wishing you a wonderful night ahead.
08/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 360 7929: Noted
09/12/23, 8:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Aisha.

I trust you're doing well and looking forward to the weekend. Referring to my earlier message, could you please let me know if you're now available to connect with us. So that we can complete our discussion?
09/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 71 951 6687: Schedule me for 10:00
09/12/23, 8:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, Aisha, we can connect at 10:00 am today, I shall wait for your response.
09/12/23, 9:59 am - +263 71 951 6687: Our application to India was done whole heartedly but due to the challenges we have faced, the aspiring student won't be financially equipped and one should leave the Family environment/ comfort zone with a settled heart   so they should kindly accept our withdrawal   . Natural disasters are meant to occur and this was not on our plans it just occurred unexpectedly.As i applied  to Edoofa i was not trying to play games with you i was very serious but due t the current situation    i personally am exhausted .So ma'am may you kindly note my withdrawal I'm sorry.
09/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 932 0751: Greetings team.                Admin Officer   the reason why we have applied or intended to learn in India is this that students acquire quality education/ skills and that your Edoofa program has the Earn as you learn program that students will raise fees for their learning.  Now ma'am  kindly understand that we are withdrawing due to the challenges we have faced because we have to use some of the money to buy house material Anyhow, we just feel it uncomfortable that Gombe leave her family environment/ comfortable zone whilst not fully equipped with the University' necessities or financially      Female students need to be presentable than males    She will try her second change next time!    As a parent I  did most of the paperwork when she was at school thinking that my child will go study in India: eish friends  it pains! Well, kindly accept our withdrawal.  We decided to build a home first because even if Aisha managed to come study there,  when she comes back home would need a home to stay!!
11/12/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Aisha.

I hope this message finds you all well. Please accept my apologies for not being in touch earlier. I was occupied with work meetings and the weekend followed, which prevented me from responding sooner. However, I have taken the time to understand the challenges you mentioned.
11/12/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Being a single parent comes with its unique set of challenges, and many students in similar situations face these as well. Despite such hurdles, numerous single parents successfully manage their child's education. Have you considered how? Either the case will be that those who do not have finances at all will not be able to get a better education at all because of these challenges because such opportunities will not come again and again they are once in a lifetime and that is why I have Parents work so hard to grab such opportunity for their children's better future. It seems you're hesitant to seize this opportunity for Aisha, possibly due to financial concerns which means you are settling down and that you do not need a better opportunity and growth for Aisha.
11/12/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But I am sure this is not the case here. The first step here is to identify the specific financial issue that's troubling you. Before we delve into that, I need to understand whether you're genuinely interested in this opportunity for Aisha. If you believe it will benefit her career, then we can certainly explore ways to make it work. Remember, the initiative to take advantage of this opportunity rests with you. I am here to assist, but only if you desire my help. Please share your thoughts and concerns so we can find the best path forward together?
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Aisha,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you. I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond.

Therefore, may I know if we are still in communication?
12/12/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
13/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 932 0751: Sorry for responding late my WhatsApp. was out dated. Officer, am genuinely interested in the programme yes but as of now I have no refunds to make the payment, I can only be able to do so by January 2024 and that is why I am withdrawing because I thought there are no negotiations in fees payment, if any please assist accordingly !!
13/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 951 6687: Sorry ma'am if it's offending but are you considering our situation currently or you are just taking it on one side
13/12/23, 6:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Aisha.

I hope you are doing well. Please do not be sorry, and you are not offending us and no one is taking your situation on one side. I was able to go through your message and was able to have a discussion with the team about your current situation. And stay assured that Ms. Vilsha, the head of admissions will be able to connect with you shortly.
