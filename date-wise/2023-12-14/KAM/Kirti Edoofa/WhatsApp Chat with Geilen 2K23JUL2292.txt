28/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/08/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes admission officer
28/08/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 220 3591: We are together go ahead
28/08/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/08/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
28/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
28/08/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/08/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 220 3591: I agree
28/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/08/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Very clear
28/08/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/08/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
28/08/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/08/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
28/08/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
28/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
28/08/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
28/08/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, If you are available, shall I share the videos with you here now?
28/08/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 220 3591: With much pleasure
28/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.

28/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
28/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
28/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
28/08/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 977 5405: Ok.. I have just went through the videos
28/08/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so could you please share your understanding of the videos?
28/08/23, 10:16 pm - +263 78 977 5405: As for the SOP of Edoofa, one of its sole mission is to provide a scholarly and professional environment to all it's students and this then motivates them to make lasting contributions to the society and become future leaders
28/08/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding I shall wait for your response to the rest of the videos
28/08/23, 10:43 pm - +263 78 977 5405: Edoofa's vision is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through the '' SEELS'' but it is also focused on increasing student' s capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent
And Edoofa did spent a lot of time good institutes for passionate Edoofians. The students are ought to follow orders as given by founders
29/08/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded our available working hours were over, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/08/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes admin
29/08/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/08/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/08/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
29/08/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 977 5405: Yes
29/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
29/08/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 977 5405: Ok go ahead
29/08/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
29/08/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

29/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Science in Biomedical Science for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
29/08/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 977 5405: Yes
29/08/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
29/08/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
29/08/23, 11:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since our available working hours are over we can connect tomorrow at 12.30 pm. I hope you will be available. Have a great night.
30/08/23, 7:16 am - +263 77 220 3591: Thank you
30/08/23, 12:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well, since we could not continue with our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/08/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
30/08/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
30/08/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
30/08/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
30/08/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Correct
30/08/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
30/08/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
30/08/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
30/08/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Go ahead
30/08/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
30/08/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Noted
30/08/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
30/08/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Very clear admin
30/08/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
30/08/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Ok
30/08/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
30/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Well answered admin
30/08/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Moving forward, I recently reviewed your application form once again and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in August 2023.

30/08/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
30/08/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey.

30/08/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now I believe you have had a discussion with your family regarding your admission process, so I would like to know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
30/08/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 220 3591: The only concern l have is to raise the required $500 or $750 registration fee at one go.
30/08/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and that is why we are here for a discussion. I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

08/09/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
08/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
08/09/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great,  Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
08/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 220 3591: No
08/09/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand Geilen, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
08/09/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
08/09/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
09/09/23, 10:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
11/09/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well, since it was the weekend, hence we could not get back to you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
11/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
11/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
11/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
11/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 220 3591: No
11/09/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/09/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
11/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Noted
11/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
11/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
12/09/23, 7:31 am - +263 77 220 3591: Clear
12/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Still busy at work
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, may I know if your parents are available to connect with us ?
12/09/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes now available
12/09/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you were clear here?
12/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Sure
12/09/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/09/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/09/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Noted
12/09/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/09/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes I understand
12/09/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/09/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/09/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about? <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 220 3591: The major challenge is to raise the said funds considering my current situation.
12/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 220 3591: I had to run around to pay my last part of the application fee of USD 250-00 and am yet to pay my fees for the other kids
12/09/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I understand that @263772203591 please understand that these dates are tentative, so please do not worry.
12/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 220 3591: OK
12/09/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
13/09/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
14/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 977 5405: Yes
14/09/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday?
15/09/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well, I was expecting to connect with you yesterday, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 977 5405: Yes
15/09/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 977 5405: Go ahead
15/09/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
15/09/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
15/09/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
15/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 977 5405: Ok very clear
15/09/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, as I was attending a meeting may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/09/23, 9:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from your side, however, you did not respond, so may I know if you are able to connect with us now?

27/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand that you must be occupied with work and hence forgot to acknowledge the messages, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/09/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Now available
30/09/23, 11:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?

05/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for the concern, I am doing great now. Yes, please it has been a long time since I heard from you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
05/10/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
05/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Point noted
05/10/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Noted
05/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772203591 I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 220 3591: I need more clarity plse
05/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Go ahead
05/10/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Go ahead
05/10/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Now in a picture
05/10/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 220 3591: No further question admin
05/10/23, 4:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Geilen's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Geilen is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes admin
05/10/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Noted, l will make payment arrangements by next week will present my proposal admin
05/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, have a great day ahead.
05/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Fantastic
02/11/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Geilen,

I trust this message finds you all in the best of health and with a positive outlook. I am delighted to have the opportunity to connect with you again, and I am eager to convey a significant update to you.

Following our previous conversation, our admissions team has been diligently engaged in the thorough evaluation of your scholarship application for Indian universities, specifically under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to announce that your application has been successfully reviewed and accepted by one of the prestigious institutions, *MVN University* in India. Furthermore, they have chosen to extend a scholarship offer to you.
02/11/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 08:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

02/11/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 220 3591: We will be waiting for you as per the scheduled time. As a family we gathered together and pray for such a golden opportunity which we were looking for. Have a blessed day Admission and extent extend our appreciation to the Edoofa family.
03/11/23, 12:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you so much for your heartfelt message. It's truly uplifting to hear about your family coming together in anticipation and gratitude for this opportunity. In that case, let us plan to reconnect in the evening at 08:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion. 

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete Geilen's university admission formalities. For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you again

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Good evening
03/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 220 3591: We went through the offer letter
03/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 220 3591: As per my understanding of the MVN University's offer letter, it's very clear that the fees structure as a parent you will not manage to stand alone but with the involvement of Edoofa it's simplified through scholarship support.
03/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that and I am glad to hear that and indeed we will be assisting you. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
03/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 220 3591: You can go ahead
03/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
03/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
03/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 220 3591: One other issue of  concern to my family is the payment of the administration and processing fee of $1000-00 in the next 15 days is a toll order to raise such a huge amount even Geilen 's morale is very low that l am now going to miss the golden opportunity
03/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 977 5405: 1.$350
2.$0
3.$1600
4.$125
5.$1000
03/11/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that it must be challenging, however, please do not worry, we do have flexible payment plans and we will discuss them as we move ahead in our discussions so please do not worry.
03/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per Geilen's offer letter, MVN University has awarded him/her a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout his/her course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to him/her will be free of cost throughout his/her stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
03/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 220 3591: What about aspect of accommodation does it include food
03/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 977 5405: Since you said the scholarship's sponsorship is 90 % does this mean the EWYL programme is inactive
03/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No please the EWYL program is fully active here and coming to your concern above. Now, regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer the self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please.
03/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Can you take us through all the stages until we reach MVN University during the first week of August 2024
03/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Would want to know how to deposit the admission fees whether through the give bank or via agents
03/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, for that, I would want you to patiently move ahead with our discussion, please and all your queries would be answered as we discuss.
03/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you can see in Geilen's offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
03/11/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that the per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means his total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, Geilen's annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
03/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Sure
03/11/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you're aware of Geilen's  per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
03/11/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how Geilen can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Please go ahead
03/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established Geilen's total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
03/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
03/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
03/11/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
03/11/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Abidul with his hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, he/she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1850. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1850 - $1000 = $850, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
03/11/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how Geilen can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
03/11/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Correct
03/11/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Geilen will dedicate himself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of his education. His mentors will undoubtedly provide him with valuable guidance to help him reach his academic and financial goals.
03/11/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in his offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
03/11/23, 10:44 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Quite clear
03/11/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
03/11/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of Geilen's application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for him. This is the reason his per annum cost of education is only $1850, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
03/11/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. But rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of Geilen's first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
03/11/23, 10:49 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
03/11/23, 10:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Geilen is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
03/11/23, 10:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
03/11/23, 10:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
03/11/23, 10:57 pm - +263 77 220 3591: I agree
03/11/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival in India.
03/11/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I hope you are clear about this as well?
03/11/23, 11:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, since it is past our available hours now. I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 08:30 a.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
03/11/23, 11:29 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Thank you have a good night
04/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Noted

06/11/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can make progress and move ahead with the admission process?
06/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 627 9777: Yes go ahead
06/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
06/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
06/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
06/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 220 3591: As a family we are very happy with offer especially that the accommodation aspect is 100% covered by Edoofa
06/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
06/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Even the tuition fee where Edoofa pays 90 percent it's a good
06/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Though as a family we were found on a precarious situation in terms of raising the initial deposit overally we are going to benefit more because the conditions stated in the offer letter are excellent given that we are talking internationally recognised MVN University.
06/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 220 3591: It appears my network is poor
06/11/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that and I am glad to know that you have a better understanding of the letter now. Now coming back to your concern as I mentioned I will get back to it on Monday I completely understand that it can be difficult to raise such an amount in that case, and I would like to know how is your preparation going so far, and what part of the registration fee have you been able to raise till now and how much to think you be will be able to raise before the first deadline?
06/11/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 220 3591: I decided to apply for a soft loan from the bank  for a "USD 1000 but subject to approval
06/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, I would like to know by when are you expecting an update from the bank regarding the same?
06/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 627 9777: Monday next week
06/11/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Monday next week would be the 14th of November which leaves only 2 days for your first deadline, god forbids if the bank does not approve the loan may I know what are your plans, how much have you raised so far, and how much will be you be able to raise before the first deadline of the university?
06/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 627 9777: 200-00
06/11/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. As you are aware you know you are supposed to make a payment of $425 and you will be able to make a payment of $200 by the given due date. In that case, I would like to understand the plans that you have in place to make the payment of the remaining $225 so that we can what possible solution  can be offered?
06/11/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 220 3591: I have already talked with the bank and have assured me that they are going to process the application in a positive way
06/11/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I can clearly see how optimistic you are for Geilen's higher education and all the efforts you are trying to put in for him. However, my question here still remains the same, if due to some unforeseen reasons the approval gets delayed in that case, what is your back up plan and if you make a payment of $200 then how are you looking forward to complete the remaining payment of $225 since your first installment is of $425? <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you however, as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:00 pm, have a great night ahead.

Is that correct?
07/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 627 9777: Exactly
07/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that and confirming that for me, before we move ahead could you please help me confirm a date and the payment mode you would use to pay the $200, and if your loan gets approved then the $425?

09/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Now available my apology was in a long meeting at work.
11/11/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. That is alright please, however, I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

15/11/23, 11:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well. I understand that the circumstances that you are in right now are difficult. However, I was hoping to get a response from you, not because of the offer letter please, as we genuinely care for you and want to be there for you during your tough time please, I request you to update us so that our associates can be with you during your tough time.
16/11/23, 7:36 am - +263 77 220 3591: I really appreciate team Edoofa for the morale support. We buried her yesterday and we are finalising a few things as per our culture and the travel back to town. Network is a bit challenge. Geilen's mother talked to Endai Matimati a proud Edoofa whom she shared a few issues with him yesterday.
16/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well. I understand that it must have been a challenging time for you, and network can also be an issue, if you are comfortable to connect I would love to know the challenges that your mother shared so that I will be able to assist you?
16/11/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yaaaa now in town but feeling tired let's connect tomorrow, have a good day.
16/11/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm, have a great night ahead.
17/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead and complete our discussion today regarding your university letter?
18/11/23, 8:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Geilen,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 220 3591: Yes we are around
18/11/23, 11:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you could share the challenge that you mentioned above?
18/11/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 220 3591: I failed to make the initial deposit of the registration fees so am requesting for the extension to end of next week because as a son-in-law the responsibility is on you on such situations
18/11/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand your situation here, and I acknowledge that this must be a challenging time for you as well since your concern was genuine and circumstances like these can make it more difficult so please I assure you I will be talking with the academic Board and present a strong case for Geilen, however, before I have a conversation I would like to understand how much are you willing to deposit to reserve Geilen's seat with the university?
18/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 220 3591: USD 850-00
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Coz  end od December I have the festive holiday and school fees for the other kids so if l finish this l will be comfortable also.
18/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
18/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Let's set 02 December 2023 and will use Mr Charles Jerera's FBC account
18/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Cash deposit into the bank account
18/11/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772203591 earlier you mentioned you would require a week's deadline which is the 25th of November, December is a very long time.
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 220 3591: I am saying it's no longer feasible to work with the 25th date due other debts l incurred.
18/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that as per the financial preparations that you have in place you have been working to complete the formalities by 2nd December 2023 and by then you would be able to make the payment of the entire fee that is due. However, you know the universities are also restricted with the due dates that they share with the students considering that there are only a limited number of seats and they have to be fair to each and every student. I would want to help you out but this is something that the university would not approve and in that case, even if the university agrees to help you with an extension they would not be able to give you the endowment benefits that have been offered which means that instead of making the payment of $850 you would have to make a payment of $1000 now this would further add on the financial burden on your head to avoid this what I can do is, I can see if it is possible to have a discussion with the Academic Board and make a plan where you make only the payment of $100 towards this month and the remaining $750 can be paid by 2nd December, with this you would still be able to secure the endowment grant of $150 and majority of the fee would be paid next month.
18/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Noted
18/11/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We will be connecting on Monday and let you know the updates after the discussion with Academic Board.
18/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 220 3591: You are welcome, enjoy your weekend
20/11/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Geilen.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
20/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes we are here
20/11/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now I would like to inform you that I was able to have a discussion with the Academic Board and I really presented a strong case for Geilen since you had gone through a lot for the past few days not only financially but also mentally because of a loss of a loved family member, and the academic board did understand that it must be a challenging time for you, and they did agreed for providing you with an extension, where you can pay $100 before the 25th of November to secure your seat so that the university does not offer the seat to any other student and the remaining $750 by December 2nd. However, if you will not be able to do the same then you will have to pay $1000 altogether by December 2nd if you do not want the endowment benefits and this would further add on the financial burden on your head. 

Since I worked really hard for you I would want your confirmation that you are positive that you will be able to pay $100 by 25th November and $750 by December 2nd, I hope you will not fail my efforts?
20/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 220 3591: It's clear
20/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you confirm the same that you are positive that you will be able to pay $100 by 25th November and $750 by December 2nd.
20/11/23, 11:03 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Yes admission
20/11/23, 11:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, let us reconnect 2 days prior to your first deadline, have a great day ahead.
21/11/23, 7:23 am - +263 77 220 3591: Message acknowledged

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to inform you that the payment for the first part of the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to know that you have acknowledged the above breakup. However, could you please let me know if you were able to go through the message I inquired about above?
09/12/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 220 3591: Yes all the transaction above are correct what is left is the payment of the outstanding balance. My Zb Bank approved my loan application but the bank is yet to make the deposit into the account. Also to note is that I have already signed the offer letter to include the two guarantors. The bank is saying they are working behind the schedule as the delays were caused by lack of funding.
09/12/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I understand may I know what update has the bank to share with you now regarding the process?
10/12/23, 8:24 am - +263 77 220 3591: They are saying wait until my turn comes
11/12/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Geilen.

11/12/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, however, since it is past our available hours in that case, we will not be able to continue with our discussion which will lead to a broken discussion so let us reconnect tomorrow and start with our discussion. I hope you will be available. Have a great night ahead.
11/12/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Same to you

Losing a family member is always difficult, and it's even more challenging when it involves making arrangements for their final journey. Please know that it's okay to take the time you need to grieve and be with your family during this period. The burial arrangements, especially in such a situation, can be emotionally challenging. My thoughts are with you and your family as you prepare for the burial on the 14th of December.
