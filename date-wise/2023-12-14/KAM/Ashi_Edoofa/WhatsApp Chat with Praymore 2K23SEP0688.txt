12/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
12/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes Ms lets start
12/09/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes ,you can proceed with the session Ms
12/09/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/09/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
12/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes Ms Kirti
12/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 847 3819: I understand it very well
12/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes l am following Ms .
12/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes ma'am its clear to me now .thank you very much .
12/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 847 3819: I don't have any query concerning these 6 steps because you explain them very well
12/09/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
12/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes Ms Kirti lets proceed
12/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
12/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
12/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
12/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes please.

13/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 847 3819: First video - Edoofa's vision for students.

Firstly students should know Edoofa's donations and plans for them as well as its expectations from them.

Students should follow instructions to avoid paying a lot of money for example a Ghanaian student called Courage who paid a lot of money to his agent initially $1000 for him to be admitted at a Chinese university. After 3 months, the student was asked to pay another $300 for his documents to be transported from China. So all students should follow instructions for them to take less time to be admitted.

Edoofa's purpose is not just for students to be admitted in the schools but their vision is to work with students on behalf of colleges for them to get employed. This creates serious demands for leaders in every industry. Edoofa's vision is also that in the next few years the youth population should be able and  capable of solving big problems, working in great jobs in different industries, serving their countries and making it a better economy. And doing well, not just financially, but mentally and  emotionally thereby creating a better life for their friends and  family. 

Edoofa make education affordable to all students who can follow instructions. Due to high demand of employment, Edoofa spend more time thinking of how many  students to be employed. 

Parents of students must also look at the structure, protocols and policies and however students need to follow instructions and be open minded 

Finally, Edoofa's vision is not just to get students affordable quality education. Students get job skills by being employed through EWYL program where they earn scholarship credits. It is also focused on increasing student's capacity for success thereby making students responsible and independent.



So students must teachable and open minded ..
13/09/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Second video :schools, colleges and universities under the Edoofa program.


Edoofa is always prepared enough to interact with different universities. There are so many colleges and universities on the Edoofa platform and the reason is because Edoofa supports students in working very hard by providing them with resources so that they can pass with flying colors.

Students must be aware of the requirements and approvals needed for international students to be admitted in universities.

Edoofa team spent more time to identify the right schools for a certain student. Moreover Edoofa program EWYL program to students for them to develop skills and focus so they can pass with flying colors. Edoofa have spent ten years of experiencing hard work and invested a lot of time in finding what makes students employable.

The combination of skills, attitude and knowledge has became the background of the Edoofa Program.

Students has developed thatg attitude of saving the community when they are done with their education. Edoofa help students to realize their communities thus giving back to the community.
13/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Additionally, I understand that Edoofa has invested ten years to identify best schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians. Founders of the Edoofa highly encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for the prestigious Institutions.
13/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Third Video : Important message for enrolled student

Enrolled students in the Edoofa program should be able to understand  that is teachable and be open minded.
They must also follow instructions through all the counseling sessions and interviews and the whole Edoofa process..
13/09/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Fourth Video : Preparation for interactive sessions with universities.

Edoofa's interaction  with different universities on behalf of the students. Edoofa team will help the students to prepare the statement of purpose to different universities.
 

 Statement of Purpose (POP) is an essay which is one of the most important aspects of my  application as it tells the admission committee that who is Praymore Ndirwo(my self) and   why I am  applying, and why I am a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what I want to do in the future. Also the Edoofa team will provide visions, academic records and also why I want to study a certain program( Buchalor of Commerce)or  .B.com . The statement of purpose will convince schools to admit the students.

NB. The Admission Board will give me a form and l will fill out that form and submit it online .
13/09/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 847 3819: This is what l understand from the four videos. Thank you Ms .
13/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding @263778473819 I must say you have really understood the videos very well. In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
13/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
13/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
13/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Thank you Ms kirti
13/09/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
13/09/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

16/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 933 0166: Good Afternoon everyone. I am sorry for not getting in touch with you yesterday because l was busy with work .. 

You can proceed with Praymore and l will support him financially .

As for now , we are on the same page .
18/09/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
18/09/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes l understand
18/09/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
18/09/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *03rd October* and *03rd November*.
18/09/23, 4:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would want your parents to be online if they are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *03rd of October and 03rd of November*), can you give us the *go-ahead* so that we can prepare your application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
18/09/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 933 0166: Good afternoon Ms Kirti (admission Officer). I just go through the conversation and l share it with my husband (praymore's father) .

18/09/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 933 0166: Ok ma'am , thank you for that
18/09/23, 5:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
18/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Thank you Ms . Thank you for the day
18/09/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Have a great day ahead.

And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University.

20/09/23, 11:41 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
20/09/23, 11:41 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Praymore!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were abel to go through the offer letter that I had shared with you here yesterday?
21/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Good afternoon Mr Milan Singh , thank you for the update , l am sorry because l was not online for the past 3 days
21/09/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright, please how are you doing today dear?
21/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 847 3819: I am doing great Mr
21/09/23, 3:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, Praymore, can you please let me know if you were able to go through the offer letter from Galgotias by now?
21/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes Mr l understand the offer letter but l want to know if it was the only university that accept my qualifications
21/09/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Praymore, regarding all the queries that you have, stay assured that we will discuss them moving towards the end of our discussion. For now, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
21/09/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 847 3819: 1) $900
2) 3 years 
3)$300
4)$750
21/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
21/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes its clear for me Sir
21/09/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
21/09/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
21/09/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
21/09/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes l understand sir
21/09/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
21/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir
21/09/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
21/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes , well noted Sir
21/09/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
21/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir
21/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
21/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
21/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
21/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir , l understand it very well . Thank you for further explanations
21/09/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/09/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/09/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 847 3819 started a call
21/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes l am in Harare
21/09/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/09/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/09/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir , thanks for this alternative way . It is more affordable and not complicated
21/09/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
21/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir
21/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 847 3819 started a call
21/09/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 847 3819: But before we go any further, I have some questions regarding that issue
21/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Noted
21/09/23, 4:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, we are about to reach the end of our discussion and we will work with queries at that time.
21/09/23, 4:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
21/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir , well noted
21/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 847 3819: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Praymore, I did not get you here well, can you please come again?
21/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 847 3819: When applying for my VISA , they say they want bank statement , so what can l do since l pay the amount in cash
21/09/23, 4:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Praymore, in that case, the bank statement of your sponsor would be needed to process your VISA dear. For now, you have the option to make the payments in cash, but by then time you would get at the stage to process your VISA, you would have to arrange a Bank Statement please.
21/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Thank you sir
21/09/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/09/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir
21/09/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
21/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 847 3819 started a call
21/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir l see
21/09/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir , so l have only one option of Galgotias or
21/09/23, 4:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are following till here?
21/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir
21/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 847 3819: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 933 0166: Good afternoon Mr  Milan , thank you for sharing this information with us . Let me try to make a prompt payment .
22/09/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 847 3819: Good afternoon Mr Milan
22/09/23, 9:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Praymore!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/09/23, 9:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, may you please let me know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
22/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 847 3819: Good morning Sir. I am fine and you
22/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir
22/09/23, 10:31 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine as well dear, thank you for asking. Now, since you are clear till here, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here?
22/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir
22/09/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: So, as of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
22/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Ok it's clear now, thank you
22/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
22/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir
22/09/23, 2:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Are you aware of the transfer option Praymore?
22/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 847 3819: I love Galgotias university though
22/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Just give me a brief but don't cancel my application with Galgotias university
22/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Don't worry sir .my family and l decided to study at Galgotias university. We can proceed with the process Mr Milan
22/09/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Praymore, I understand what you are trying to say here. Let me first help you in getting a proper understanding here. Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
22/09/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
22/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir l understand, thank you so much
22/09/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be clear about the transfer option and how your admission would be navigated ahead, right?
22/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes sir
22/09/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Any other queries that you may want to share with me here Praymore?
22/09/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 847 3819: I am answered sir
22/09/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Thank you sir
23/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 847 3819: Good morning Sir
24/09/23, 7:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Praymore!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/09/23, 7:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

04/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU from Galgotias University, you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money.

13/12/23, 8:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
13/12/23, 8:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
13/12/23, 8:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
13/12/23, 8:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
