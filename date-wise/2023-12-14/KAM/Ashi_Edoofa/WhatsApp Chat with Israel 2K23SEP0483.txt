14/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Done
14/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Very clear maam
14/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 570 1107: We are together
14/09/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/09/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Very clear you ma proceed
14/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes you can go ahead
14/09/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/09/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/09/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
14/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes maam
14/09/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
14/09/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

14/09/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
14/09/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
14/09/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
14/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 570 1107: I will br done by 6 pm
14/09/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm, to move ahead with the discussion.
14/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Noted
14/09/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
14/09/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 570 1107: The two important qualities of successful Edoofians are student who follow instructions and who are open minded. The most important charachter that distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd is being able to maximise the capacity of any opportunity that comes their way. There are 250 schools. Colleges and universities that are working with edoofa. And the students are settling in well in those school. Lastly the SOP Is the next step where the student has to make the best first impression
14/09/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Good evening maam that was my understanding from the videos i watched
14/09/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/09/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/09/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
14/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Absolutely, I understood
14/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
14/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Ok understood
14/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
14/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

Programming involves writing instructions (code) that a computer can understand and execute. It is the process of creating software, applications, and websites by using specific programming languages. Programming languages provide a set of rules and syntax to write these instructions.

JavaScript: It is the go-to language for web development, enabling interactivity on websites and powering many web applications.
Python: Known for its simplicity and readability, Python is extensively used in fields like data science, artificial intelligence, and web development.
15/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Question 5:

Compilers: A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code before execution. It takes the complete program as input, analyzes it, and generates an executable file. 

Interpreters: An interpreter reads and executes the source code line by line, translating and executing each line in real-time. It doesn't generate an independent executable file. Instead, it interprets and executes the code on the fly.This approach allows for easier debugging and faster development cycles since changes in the code can be immediately tested without the need for compilation.
Compilers translate the entire code into machine code before execution, while interpreters execute the code line by line in real-time.

16/09/23, 10:22 am - Kirti Edoofa added +263 77 494 6012
16/09/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 570 1107: Yes

16/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 570 1107: Yes we are
16/09/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 570 1107: 07 74946012
16/09/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 570 1107: Can you pliz add the contact above its israels other contact. The one he is using now
16/09/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please, check Israel, has been added to the group.
16/09/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
16/09/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
16/09/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
16/09/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/09/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 570 1107: Of cause yes
16/09/23, 10:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
16/09/23, 10:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
16/09/23, 10:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
16/09/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 494 6012: Yes I'm in
16/09/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 494 6012: Noted
16/09/23, 10:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
16/09/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 570 1107: Yes we are
16/09/23, 10:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
16/09/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 570 1107: Yes we have
16/09/23, 10:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
16/09/23, 10:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
16/09/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 570 1107: Thats manageable
16/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 494 6012: That's feasible
16/09/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed and I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
16/09/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
16/09/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
16/09/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/09/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 570 1107: Do you have any idea how much the visa fees might cost?
16/09/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, yes, please the cost for the visa is $83.
16/09/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 570 1107: This message was deleted
16/09/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 570 1107: Thank you you may proceed
16/09/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
16/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 570 1107: No
16/09/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
16/09/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
16/09/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes understood thats quite an offer
16/09/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, we want the best for Israel, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
16/09/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes I would like to
16/09/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
16/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes sure
16/09/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
16/09/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
16/09/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
16/09/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Done
16/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
16/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
16/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes

21/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Israel.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the statement of entry for  A-level, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Good afternoon. Available now
21/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great so may I know if you have any queries here?
21/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 494 6012: All clear
21/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes
21/09/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/09/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Understandable
21/09/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm to continue with our discussion as our available working hours are over for now, I hope you will be available.
21/09/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes i will be available

06/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 570 1107: No
06/10/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Would you pliz provide information
06/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
06/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
06/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
06/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
07/10/23, 8:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Israel

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are facing any challenges, since I noticed that you were able to go through my message?
07/10/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and a great weekend ahead.
08/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 494 6012: No challenges yet.
09/10/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Israel.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
09/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes ma'am I'm available now
09/10/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that so may I know if you are clear so far?
09/10/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 494 6012: everything is clear so far
09/10/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
09/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 494 6012: yes sure
09/10/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Ok I would like to seek clarification on benefit number six. Where do I pursue a diploma course, is it that I pursue here in Zimbabwe or in India at that very same university? <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The diploma course would be pursued in India, @263774946012 let me help you understand the points more clearly.
09/10/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes this is clear
09/10/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 494 6012: How long does it take to complete the diploma course
09/10/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A diploma is a 3-year course.
09/10/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Ok I'm sure everything is clear on benefit six
09/10/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Ok I understood all the three points.
09/10/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 494 6012: No queries yet
09/10/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes sure I can't wait
09/10/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
09/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 494 6012: I grasped everything that u have taught me.
09/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Ur patience is greatly appreciated. Thank you for this session wish you a blessed day too
09/10/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You're very welcome, Israel! I'm delighted to hear that you've grasped the information, and I appreciate your kind words have a great day ahead.
09/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Same applies 👏
13/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 570 1107: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 570 1107: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 9:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Israel.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your remaining Edoofa enrollment fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you.
14/10/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 570 1107: Noted thank you
14/10/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 494 6012: Noted with thanks
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Israel.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Gulzar Group of Institutes in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 01.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Okay .....so only one university will accept or there will be a variety ?
16/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, we will discuss that moving ahead during our conversation. For now, may you please go through the letter and let me know of this?
16/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Per annum tution fee - 1200.     Accommodation - 1200. Registration fee 15 to 30
17/10/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Israel!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1200.
17/10/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
17/10/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1200+ $1250) = $2450.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1200 + $1000) = $2200.
17/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Following
17/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Evening how are you Mr Milan
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Israel!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad you understand. Given the fact that there are two options for accommodation at Gulzar Group of Institutes, which category would you like to choose for yourself?
18/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 494 6012: I would prefer three-seater
18/10/23, 5:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: You can surely opt for that option. I also want to inform you that one can easily upgrade or downgrade their accommodation after coming to India, the option will stay open for them.
18/10/23, 5:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: In this case, as you want to opt for three-seater accommodation, your per annum fee is $2450 which can be paid in two parts of $1225 at a gap of 6 months and can be reduced with the help of the EWYL Program as well as much you want.
18/10/23, 5:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: This per annum fee includes your tuition fee, library fee, living expenses, food cost, and other basic amenities such as 24-hour wifi cost, water, and electricity bills. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Would you pliz explain where you said "can be reduced with the help of EWYL"

19/10/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Israel!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Afternoon Mr Milan.
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 494 6012: We will be available for the session.
19/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Good evening
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Israel!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Ready now
19/10/23, 10:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, this means that the students can earn credits with the help of the EWYL Program and reduce the cost of the same. I hope this is clear?
19/10/23, 10:21 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes
19/10/23, 10:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 10:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes clear
19/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2450 and so the balance fee becomes $2450 - $1000 = $1450 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
20/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Sure thank yoy
20/10/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.
20/10/23, 1:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the same time, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well - 

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee of $2450, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2450 - $750= $1700, and that can be paid in two parts of $850 at a gap of 6 months. 

Are we on the same page here as well?
20/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Absolutely
20/10/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/10/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 29th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 29th November 2023.*
20/10/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *29th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes I'm clear on this
20/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes we are situated In Harare
20/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Thank you.
20/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Mr Milan would you please assist me I have a question in mind
20/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, what is it?
20/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Is GGI the only university that offered me a scholarship or there will be more such as galgotia
20/10/23, 3:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here dear. Now, on that note, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
20/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes I'm clear sir
20/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Thank your sir. I would greatly appreciate you helping me in making an informed decision. How does it go if I pay fee mentioned above then another university accept the application. I'm ready to take whatever advice you share with me sir
20/10/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Gulzar, you would lose out on the scholarship from Gulzar and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 494 6012: No I'm not aware sir
20/10/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Gulzar without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/10/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Gulzar to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Gulzar, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Thank you for making me understand. I would greatly appreciate if you help me choose the best universities as we go. Now I'm clear sir
20/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. Now, moving ahead, may I know if you have taken a note of Mr. Rajan's details so that we can proceed?
20/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes Noted with thanks
20/10/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes you can share but I think the first option is more feasible. You can send so that I will discuss with my parents with all the details at hand
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

20/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Ok sir one last question that I might want to ask is that what is the probability that after completing school I might get employed in India and does Adoofa assist students to get attachments and employment as well
20/10/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Absolutely, I'm glad to hear that you're interested in your future and career prospects. GGI is indeed committed to supporting its students in every way possible, and we will certainly assist you in your journey towards a successful career.
