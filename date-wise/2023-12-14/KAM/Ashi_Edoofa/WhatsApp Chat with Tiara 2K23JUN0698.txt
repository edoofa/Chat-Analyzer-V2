I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM. I understand that your schedules can be quite hectic, but I believe that dedicating just one hour of your time will be worthwhile. Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
07/10/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tiara.

I've been unwell, but I'm glad to report that I'm now on the path to recovery and looking forward to reconnecting with all of you. Are you currently available to connect with us?
07/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 528 9514: Available. Good to know that you are in full health.
07/10/23, 11:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Thank you in picture now.
07/10/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 528 9514: As my understanding. It the stage where by our program authorities will be looking for University vacancies from different universities if my memory do not betray me at Edoofa we deal with seven different Universities. Of which will apply and compare the suitable University which fits my with the student program. And if found one the admission fees applies to secure the university seat for the August 2024 program.
07/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Suitable university which fits with my or student program👆
07/10/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
07/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 528 9514: For now no queries antiently wait to hear from you.
07/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
07/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Sure a bit
07/10/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
07/10/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
07/10/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
07/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and a great weekend ahead.
07/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Same to you thank u.
09/10/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tiara.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
09/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Sure we can go ahead
09/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
09/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
09/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Yes can proceed by explaining
09/10/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*


On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tiara, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 528 9514: If i may ask. Can you simplify or explain a bit on how Tiara can secure her seat before the competition. What requirements maybe needed.
09/10/23, 6:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, @263715289514 as we move ahead with our discussions all your points of concern will be cleared. I hope we are clear?
09/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Okay i get it we can proceed
09/10/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Quite clear with me
09/10/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Clear with me go ahead
09/10/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Clear with me. Seems the same as the first part of the Edoofian cycle.
09/10/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Assist me with the info pliz
09/10/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
09/10/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Yes please
09/10/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
09/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Clear with me
09/10/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Clear
09/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Quite clear
09/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Yes pliz
09/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Clear bt not exciting to hear
09/10/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please I understand and I am sure that Tiara will will make you proud and this situation will never come up. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Sure in picture now
09/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Tiara's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Tiara is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
09/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Antietly waiting for
09/10/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
09/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Good night thank you
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tiara.

15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Okay clear with me
15/10/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 7:44 am - +263 71 528 9514: Clear,  bt if i may ask. Does the scholarship take any part on the accommodation and food expenses?
16/10/23, 9:01 am - +263 71 528 9514: Tiara Net 1.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 528 9514: Its Tiara's tag
16/10/23, 9:30 am - +263 71 528 9514: May you please add the above contact.
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tiara!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, on that note, I would like to mention that since accommodation is considered as a personal expense, therefore, the scholarship does not cover the same and hence is only applicable on the tuition fee. May I know if that is clear?
16/10/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Quite clear
16/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 71 528 9514: What about the $300 admission fees, i need a clarification on how to pay it. (One time payable).
16/10/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss that please. Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Together can go ahead
16/10/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
16/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Yes please we can proceed to that
17/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and tiara!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
17/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Yes noted
17/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 528 9514: We are fine and you
17/10/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
17/10/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
17/10/23, 1:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Yes this I understandable
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Yes Harare'
17/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Tiara Net 1.vcf (file attached)
17/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Can you please add tiara's new number to the group
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/10/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 3:34 am - +263 71 508 6191 was added
19/10/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tiara!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 7:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 508 6191: Oky noted
19/10/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Tiara!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 71 508 6191: Yes ys
19/10/23, 7:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, moving ahead, may I know if you have taken a note of Mr. Rajan's details so that we can proceed?
20/10/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tiara!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion, for now, can you please let me know of the time when we can connect with each other here to proceed with our conversation?
20/10/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 528 9514: If you are ready we can proceed right now.
20/10/23, 12:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, can you please also answer this question as well?
20/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Correct i have the details for Mr Rajah
20/10/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now,  Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Sure go ahead
20/10/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Noted with thanks.
20/10/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Noted
20/10/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/10/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Clear with me
20/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Sure  vt helpful indeed
20/10/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 528 9514: For now none, bt if any arises will just come out with it. We can proceed to conclude
20/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

21/10/23, 8:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tiara!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
21/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 71 528 9514: Correct done so as a family.
21/10/23, 11:38 am - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
21/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Went very well all with positive attitude. And everyone was very delighted to have such a great opportunity for our child to pursue her studies abroad. On the other hand we are raising and keep on raising the flag high to Edoofa for such great work on assisting children from African countries to pursue their studies abroad. And for now we are still to come out with a concrete decision whether Tiara will stay outside the university campus or else. Since she will be in a different country with different culture as well.
21/10/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
21/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 528 9514: So far so good we can proceed.
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tiara!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
23/10/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 508 6191: Yes yes we did
23/10/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.
 
Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
23/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 528 9514: My wish is to make a one payment, bt if it goes otherwise.
23/10/23, 12:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Making a one-time payment can be a good choice if you have the means to do so. It simplifies the process and ensures that the registration fee is settled in one go. However, considering that circumstances can vary, it's also essential to have a plan in case you encounter any unexpected challenges. I hope you understand that, right?
23/10/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Quite clear
23/10/23, 12:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
23/10/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 528 9514: For now not have the exact date. But i promise by the end of day And Tues or Wed i be in light by then i will notify the payment plan and what means to use, but preferably Mr Shori's account is my choice.
23/10/23, 12:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. As you navigate through your admission journey, please remember that if you encounter any challenges or have any concerns that could potentially hinder your progress, do not hesitate to reach out to me here. I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
23/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Acknowledged. I will diffinately do.
23/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate you for keeping me informed. I will also ensure that the university officials are updated on our progress.

With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
23/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you've made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I’m here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!
23/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Same applies thank you.
25/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Afternoon. I hv managed to make up a two way payment plan. Of which tomorrow i going to pay up $300.  But will update you for the means of payment tomorrow.

I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.

09/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 528 9514: Same to you, thank you so much for keep me informed.
21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents and Tiara!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
21/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 508 6191: OK noted with thanks

University Name: Galgotias University

Registration Fee Due: $750
Endowment Grant: $150
Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $750 - $150 = $600

Payment Mode Used:  Through Mr. Shorwi and Mr. Charles
International Transfer Charges: $75 (12.5% of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $600 + $75 = $675

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $450 (Paid on 28-Oct-2023, 30-Nov-2023)

Balance Amount Due: $675 - $450 = $225

As per the payment plan shared by the university, the remaining balance of $225 is to be paid on or before the due date of 15th Decamber 2023. It's worth noting that the earlier you make this payment, the sooner you'll be able to complete your university admission process.
11/12/23, 7:51 pm - +263 71 528 9514: How are Maam. We are doing very well. According to your records that's 100% correct as compared to mine also. But on another issue i don't know how we can be assisted because as i am looking things on my side. I am not be able to full fill my balance of $225 as i promised to fullfil it on or before the 15th of December 2023. I have been supposed to receive the finance from my employer, but the promise have been postponed to the end of December or 1st week of January 2024. The date maybe clarified with time. So i don't know if my excuse may be considered. I am very sorry for the inconvenience i may have caused. But really i will fulfill my balance without too much delay.
11/12/23, 8:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine dear, thank you for asking. I am glad to know that the shared fees break up is correct. With this said, as you have shared a concern regarding the due date for your remaining amount of $225, I want to know what happened as I believe you must have planned your finances accordingly that's why you have asked for the extension till 15th of December, right? <This message was edited>

I  had a guaranteed promise with my employer of which the account department gave a last excuse of cash shortages as the company was paying a 13 the month salaries of which they said they exceeded their annual budget.

12/12/23, 8:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing more about your concern @263715289514, Although postponing the deadline to January is a concern for the university as we have already made a request to them for the extension. However, being your admission officer I want to make an effort to find a workable solution, I have been exploring the potential of establishing a payment plan. However, before finalizing this plan, it's important that we gain a comprehensive understanding of your current financial situation. 

Hence, I wanted to understand the amount you've managed to set aside as of now for the remaining amount. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
13/12/23, 6:18 am - +263 71 528 9514: That was a good idea Ma'am, but the real situation on me i am grounded since i was fully based or relieng on my employer's. I don't any spared funds. I don't know if my current situation can be considered.
13/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tiara, I hope you are doing well. 

While I understand your situation, it's also important for me to have a clear idea about your plans for completing the payment as only then I'll be able to help you. I hope you understand?
