I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa.

20/09/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Yes we still remember  the procedures.
20/09/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
20/09/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 503 7285: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Sorry sir, personally I have forgotten.
20/09/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
20/09/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Proceed, sir
20/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
20/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
20/09/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Yes, it's now clear.I recalled.
20/09/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2700 to $3700, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $2000 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
20/09/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $2000 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $3000 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $3000 - $750 = $2250. You can pay this in two installments of $1125 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
20/09/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Clear sir.
20/09/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
20/09/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Let's me discuss with my family so that we help each other with questions
20/09/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
20/09/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Thank you sir for this wonderful session.
21/09/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
21/09/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Sorry, sir for being unavailable it was due to network problem to purchase data bundles.Once again sorry
21/09/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Okay sir, thank you
22/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Good day sir
22/09/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
25/09/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely afternoon?
25/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 503 7285: I'm okay sir,I hope you doing well
25/09/23, 3:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Ready sir
25/09/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
25/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 503 7285: No queries on the admission process but the  costs seems to be above our ability.
25/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 503 7285: The registration fee of $750 which  will be paid before two weeks, time frame is too short
25/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 503 7285: If we can be informed in time, we can maybe able to pay
25/09/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly you will be well informed in time for that.
25/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Okay sir
25/09/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are now ready to move on with the session?
25/09/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Ready sir
25/09/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/09/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
25/09/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 503 7285: We are together sir
25/09/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/09/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
25/09/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
25/09/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 503 7285: We are ready, sir.
25/09/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/09/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
25/09/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
25/09/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 503 7285: I have reviewed
25/09/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/09/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
25/09/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 503 7285: It's clear.
25/09/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/09/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/09/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/09/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Yes,sir.
25/09/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/09/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
25/09/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Yes, you clearly explaining.
25/09/23, 10:47 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Thank you for the informative session
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Ready sir.
26/09/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/09/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/09/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 503 7285: So far it's clear sir. 💓
26/09/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 503 7285: May, you provide the information on it, so that we will move together
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Now clear sir, we can continue.
26/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 503 7285: That's true, they won't be able to be pursue a meaningful bachelor's education.
26/09/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 503 7285: I think as discussed before, she will retake A then proceeds in 2025
26/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 503 7285: A Level
26/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if there is any challenges with the current A level?
26/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 503 7285: No challenges at all.She is doing her best.
26/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Then would be able to clear me on the part that "she will retake A Level then proceeds in 2025"
26/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 503 7285: I was just recalling on the previous lesson.Rest assured she will score more than 15 points
26/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 503 7285: I'm sure these won't apply to Mascelyn
26/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am really happy to hear that.  Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Okay.
26/09/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Clear sir.
26/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/09/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Yes sir.
26/09/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/09/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/09/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Same to you.
27/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Doing well sir. Ready
27/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 503 7285: No quries
27/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Mascelyn's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Mascelyn  is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
27/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 503 7285: I can't wait.Please proceed.
27/09/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Mascelyn's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
27/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Okay sir, thank you.
14/10/23, 8:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mascelyn.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Lovely Professional University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now! <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 8:49 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 12.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 8:49 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 645 9795: Thank u very much
14/10/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 645 9795: I think they made a mistake on her date of birth...its 3 February 2005
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prosper!

Thank you for letting me know of that please. I have taken a note of that and we will get it corrected. For now, may I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from LPU by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 503 7285: I'm glad as a parent.
14/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 503 7285: It's Mascelyn not Prosper.
14/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 503 7285: I went through the letter,we need to discuss with the father so that we come up with helpful and relevant questions.
14/10/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for the confusion with the names dear. Now, that you have gone through the letter, may I know if we can move ahead to discuss it so that you can have a better clarity about the same?
14/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Go ahead sir for the mean time.
14/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 503 7285: How much will this be for a semester.The second one.
14/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 503 7285: My question is the 700 is it part of the University fees or we will have to add $1250 +700
14/10/23, 3:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mascelyn, that message was not meant for you dear, it was sent by mistake please. Now, as you have gone through the offer letter, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
14/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 503 7285: 1. 1225 USD
2. 4 years or 8 semesters
3. 200USD
4. 700USD
14/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
14/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Yes sir
14/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 503 7285: You can proceed l have understood
14/10/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
14/10/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
14/10/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
14/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Okay
14/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
14/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
14/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Yes sir
14/10/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
14/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Can you acquire eye spectacles using the medical  health insurance policy or l will have to use my own personal money for this
14/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Does the medical health insurance policy cover for a specialist review or it only covers for basic medication like acquiring paracetamol
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mascelyn!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to the support that you can get from the Insurance, it is only applicable in cases where the expenses are quite high such as in a situation of a major accident or treatment of a condition, or when you fall sick for a long time. 

If god forbid something like that happens to you, then your expenses for the same would be covered. Otherwise, for such smaller expenses such as normal medicines of spectacles, you can do that by yourself. I hope this is clear?
15/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Okay sir
15/10/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $700 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$275 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$275 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $550 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mascelyn!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter please?
16/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Noted sir.
16/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 503 7285: We opt for this one
16/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Doing good and you?
16/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 503 7285: It's clear continue sir
16/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Sir, I am experiencing network challenges, but I will make effort to get in touch.
16/10/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. May you please let me know of this as well.
16/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 503 7285: We reside in Gweru.
17/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mascelyn!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 10:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mascelyn!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 10:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion here. May I know if we can proceed with the same now?
19/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 503 7285: Sorry sir, I experienced power cuts due to continuous rain so the phone was done.Once again sorry for the inconvenience.
19/10/23, 9:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mascelyn!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:19 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, I understand that. Now, on that note, shall we move ahead with our discussion here now?
19/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 503 7285: You can go ahead but anytime I will be offline
19/10/23, 9:21 am - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask why is that dear?
19/10/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 503 7285: My battery is 10% as I said before it's raining.
19/10/23, 9:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, let us try to conclude the discussion as soon as we can here and then we will proceed, shall we?
20/10/23, 8:03 am - +263 77 503 7285: Sir, I want to enquire if it's possible to use Ecco-Cash for payment.
20/10/23, 8:06 am - +263 77 503 7285: I was enquiring about other means of payment methods of Registration fees because it will be expensive to travel to Harare then pay the 7% and then the fees.
20/10/23, 11:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mascelyn!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Good day sir.You may share once again
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Thank you.
20/10/23, 8:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/10/23, 8:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 503 7285: It's clear.
20/10/23, 9:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Is it possible to pay for accommodation in installments that is $1665
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 503 7285: Sir may you please shed some light on the fees ie the provisional registration fee and the admission processing fee
20/10/23, 9:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the accommodation fee of $1,665, yes, it is possible to pay it in installments. Typically, the accommodation fee is due at the beginning of the academic year. However, if paying it all at once is a challenge, we can work on a payment plan that allows you to pay it in installments, i.e. half of it in each semester. 

Regarding the fees, the provisional registration fee is a one-time fee that you pay when you confirm your intention to join Galgotias University. It serves as a confirmation of your acceptance. The admission processing fee covers the cost of processing your application, verifying your documents, and facilitating the admission process. For the latter, you would have to pay that once Mascelyn will arrive here in India.
24/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mascelyn!
I hope you are doing well today.

As you may know, today was Dussehra, a significant festival here in India, and our team was not available due to the holiday. On this auspicious occasion of Dussehra, I also extend my warmest wishes to you and your family. May the festival bring joy, prosperity, and success into your life. ✨

On that note, I would like to schedule a conversation with you at 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our discussion here about your admission process. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow, until then have a blessed evening!
25/10/23, 9:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mascelyn!

25/10/23, 1:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: How are you doing today Mascelyn?
16/11/23, 8:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Esteemed Parents and Mascelyn!
I trust you're all doing well.

I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?

13/12/23, 9:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mascelyn ,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

Firstly, I am delighted to inform you that the payment you have made for the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly in order to ensure a seamless transition in your application process.
13/12/23, 9:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
13/12/23, 9:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
13/12/23, 9:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
13/12/23, 9:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
