For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
19/08/23, 1:48 pm - +260 772423828: Okay
19/08/23, 1:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/08/23, 1:53 pm - +260 772423828: Done
19/08/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/08/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
19/08/23, 2:02 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
19/08/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/08/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/08/23, 2:04 pm - +260 772423828: Am following
19/08/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
19/08/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
19/08/23, 2:06 pm - +260 772423828: Very clear
19/08/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
19/08/23, 2:07 pm - +260 772423828: No queries
19/08/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
19/08/23, 2:08 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
19/08/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, Dear. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
19/08/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

I am sharing you with the videos now, dear.
19/08/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
19/08/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
19/08/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
19/08/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
19/08/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
19/08/23, 2:17 pm - +260 772423828: Students should be open minded and must follow instructions
19/08/23, 2:36 pm - +260 772423828: Edoofa's vision is not just to provide students with affordable high quality education and making students employable through the SEELS program but it's also focused on increasing capacity for success which makes them responsible and independent
19/08/23, 2:51 pm - +260 772423828: Founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institutions
19/08/23, 2:57 pm - +260 772423828: Students should be prompt in taking action and be diligent in filling out the form
19/08/23, 2:59 pm - +260 772423828: Am done ✅
19/08/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
19/08/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
19/08/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
19/08/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now, dear?
19/08/23, 3:05 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
19/08/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, dear. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
19/08/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday at 12:00 PM. <This message was edited>
19/08/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully.

19/08/23, 3:23 pm - +260 772423828: I have a question
19/08/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please ask, dear.
19/08/23, 3:30 pm - +260 772423828: So does it mean that I have to answer 2 to 5 in the same 150 to 200 words
19/08/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That would be accurate, dear.
19/08/23, 3:31 pm - +260 772423828: Okay thanks
19/08/23, 6:50 pm - +260 772423828: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 10:36 am - +260 772423828: BPM, is a systematic approach to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes within an organization to achieve specific or improved business goals.The BPM lifecycle is comprised of five phases : process design, modeling, execution, monitoring, and optimization. Each phase of the lifecycle builds on the previous one, and the result is an efficient and effective business process management system that meets the needs of the business. By following the BPM lifecycle, organizations can ensure that their business processes are continuously improved and aligned with their strategic goals.
Business contribute to economic development by bringing employment Opportunities to economy. Because It requires more people for the production activities, hence more people are employed.
At school we never used to be given any notes for commerce so it was all research work for us we were divided into groups so each member had a specific role to research and we would present the work as a team.
HR improves the company's bottom line with its knowledge of how human capital affects organizational success. Leaders with expertise in HR strategic management participate in corporate decision-making that underlies current staffing assessments and projections for future workforce needs based on business demand.
21/08/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $1000, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $1500.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $1500-$1000 = $500 and can be paid in two installments of $250 at a gap of 6 months.
21/08/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
21/08/23, 2:42 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
21/08/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be?
21/08/23, 2:44 pm - +260 772423828: No
21/08/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs. Furthermore, your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program is scheduled to begin alongside our ongoing session. So, I am now sharing you with the EWYL details soon first.

21/08/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Speaking of which, there's an exciting Early Decision Benefit available for applicants for the 2024 intake. It's designed to provide advantageous terms for those who choose to make an early commitment to their admission process. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
21/08/23, 8:00 pm - +260 772423828: Yes but you can explain a little bit more
21/08/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I understand Joshua, it is alright. So, basically under this program, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.*
21/08/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
21/08/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
21/08/23, 8:13 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
21/08/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
21/08/23, 8:52 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
21/08/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.  We came up with a solution to help students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Get Early Access to Scholarship Seats in the Top Indian Universities with Edoofa.

2. Get an opportunity to keep your university fee structure as of the current batch of admissions.

3. Get an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. No Financial Pressure of making the payment in one go, there is an option of making the payment of the registration fee in 2 parts over a period of 30-45 days.

And for the student, who are yet to write their A-Level (Grade 12) Exams, they get the following 2 benefits as well if they choose to get the early decision benefits:

5. If a student fails to bring in a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, an option to change the course to a Diploma Program will be given so that the student doesn't lose a year.

6. If a student fails to bring in a minimum of 2 passes in the A-level Examination, and neither wants to start a diploma course, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program.*

Are you clear on these benefits?
21/08/23, 8:59 pm - +260 772423828: Am clear
21/08/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
21/08/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your Grade 12 and Grade 9 results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
21/08/23, 9:36 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
21/08/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023. 

Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.

Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
21/08/23, 9:41 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
21/08/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
21/08/23, 9:47 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
21/08/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving an option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 30th August 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 30th August 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 30th September 2023. Any queries so far?
21/08/23, 9:53 pm - +260 772423828: No clear
21/08/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
21/08/23, 10:07 pm - +260 772423828: Clear
21/08/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. And let us continue our session tomorrow at 7:30 PM. I hope you have a great night and my warm wishes to your family as well.
21/08/23, 10:10 pm - +260 772423828: Okay
23/08/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Joshua. How are you doing today?
23/08/23, 7:54 pm - +260 772423828: Am okay how are you
23/08/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am fine, thank you for asking, dear. I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decisions, as we touched upon yesterday.
23/08/23, 8:13 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
23/08/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
23/08/23, 8:19 pm - +260 772423828: My dad has been traveling so he didn't have time
23/08/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, dear. It is alright, may I know when you might be able to have a discussion with your parents?
23/08/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/08/23, 8:29 pm - +260 772423828: Tomorrow
23/08/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. So, in that case shall we schedule our session for tomorrow at 7:30 PM?
23/08/23, 9:06 pm - +260 772423828: Okay
23/08/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, dear. We shall connect at the said time.
23/08/23, 10:15 pm - +260 772423828: Okay
24/08/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Joshua,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
24/08/23, 7:51 pm - +260 772423828: Good evening
24/08/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon yesterday.
24/08/23, 8:00 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
24/08/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
24/08/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. If your dad is stationary at the moment. May I know what his thoughts about the same?
24/08/23, 8:31 pm - +260 772423828: It's good
24/08/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. Before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are here with us active in the conversation, and have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
24/08/23, 8:41 pm - +260 772423828: No questions
24/08/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. Could you also let me know if your dad is available here with us for the session?
24/08/23, 8:54 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
24/08/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
24/08/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due will be mentioned.
24/08/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $1000 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $1200 to $1500. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same? <This message was edited>
24/08/23, 9:01 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
24/08/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. I would also like you to understand the importance of the deadlines given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes if one misses the same.
24/08/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university, If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and they cannot take admission into that particular university for the current academic year, the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
24/08/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
24/08/23, 9:05 pm - +260 772423828: Clear
24/08/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

1. Proceed as per the standard procedures
2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits
24/08/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Be assured that I would help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
24/08/23, 9:07 pm - +260 772423828: Yes
24/08/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear, Joshua. Let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $1000 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $1000 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $1000.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 5th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 20th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. May I know if we are on the same page here as well?
24/08/23, 9:13 pm - +260 772423828: Following
24/08/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 4 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -
24/08/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3) 

To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
24/08/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 05th of September, the deadline becomes the 20th of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 05th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 20th of September 2023, making the second deadline be the 20th of October, 2023).

*Please note that the fees are an assumption for your understanding; however, the grant of $150 will remain constant.*
24/08/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well.
24/08/23, 9:18 pm - +260 772423828: Following
24/08/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
24/08/23, 9:23 pm - +260 772423828: No questions
24/08/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
24/08/23, 9:38 pm - +260 772423828: The admission process begins when parents/guardians give the go ahead
First part of admission to be paid in 15 days which is 300
Second part to be paid with in a month
24/08/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Are you clear on this as well?
24/08/23, 9:43 pm - +260 772423828: Clear
24/08/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
24/08/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Wednesday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750(Assumed) will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *20th September* and *20th October*.
24/08/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines (*20th September* and *20th October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Joshua's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board? <This message was edited>
25/08/23, 10:06 am - +260 97 7319106: Sorry for the late response.. however I think it's ok
25/08/23, 12:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Joshua. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed further with the discussion, dear?
25/08/23, 12:33 pm - +260 97 7319106: Yes
25/08/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to heart that Mr. Cosam. How is your family doing today?
25/08/23, 12:39 pm - +260 97 7319106: We're all fine hope you are too
25/08/23, 12:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Cosam. Yes me and my family are doing well thank you for asking. So in light of our previous conversation. May I know if you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines (*20th September* and *20th October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Joshua's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
25/08/23, 12:43 pm - +260 97 7319106: Sure
25/08/23, 12:46 pm - +260 97 7319106: Sorry I think on the dates can't it be moved further like month end
25/08/23, 12:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to know that the dates mentioned are the tentative dates and we have a chance to further extend the dates based on the offer letter that you will be receiving from the universities. If you are still finding it might be a challenge to you. You can please let me know of the same.
25/08/23, 1:31 pm - +260 97 7319106: You can go ahead..i was just trying to mention that mostly i get paid on the month end
25/08/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Mr. Cosam. Before we proceed, please note that the documents need to be shared with the universities, and they are strict about the deadlines as mentioned above. Since you have informed us that you usually receive your salary at the beginning of the month, and considering that we are currently at the end of the month, may I inquire whether you have considered managing some of this month's finances in order to meet the fees on the 20th of September?
25/08/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 7319106: Yes
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Joshua’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by (*20th September* and *20th October*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
25/08/23, 2:27 pm - +260 97 7319106: Yeah
25/08/23, 2:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please Mr. Cosam, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Joshua’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Joshua’s higher education well.
25/08/23, 2:35 pm - +260 97 7319106: For now no.. thanks
25/08/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
01/09/23, 8:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Joshua!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from MVN University, along with a remarkable 100% scholarship! Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨
01/09/23, 8:17 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a 100% scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
01/09/23, 8:17 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 10:21 am - +260 97 7319106: Good morning and thank you for the offer letter
01/09/23, 10:39 am - +260 97 7319106: Point of collection the country is Zambia not Zimbabwe and also tentative start is it August 2023 or August 2024? I need a clarity on the same
01/09/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1500 - $1000 = $500.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
01/09/23, 2:26 pm - +260 97 7319106: Ok
01/09/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the admission fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
01/09/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, we understand that in addition to the 90-100% scholarship opportunity, the admission fee of $1000 can be challenging for some parents. To make it more affordable, we are offering a payment plan for the same. Along with that since you also have the EDB Grant of $150, hence, you would have to make the payment of the admission fee after the grant, i.e. $850 in two equal parts as:

1. *$425 before 15th September 2023.*
2. *$425 before 15th October 2023.*
01/09/23, 2:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $1000  within 15 days by *15th September 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
01/09/23, 2:33 pm - +260 97 7319106: Yes we are!
01/09/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
01/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
01/09/23, 2:53 pm - +260 97 7319106: Yes
01/09/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, If you and your parents wish to use the same mode of payment as before, you can do that as well. Let me reshare the account details with you once -
01/09/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 3:44 pm - +260 97 7319106: Ok

02/09/23, 8:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?

02/09/23, 10:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for putting your query forward. Now, regarding that, may I know if you are aware about the Early Decision Benefits that I believe Mr. Shivjeet must have discussed with you earlier during the discussion about the admission process, right?
02/09/23, 10:16 am - +260 97 7319106: Yes
02/09/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if I may ask are you clear about what the Early Decision Benefits hold for you if you choose to complete the admission process early?
02/09/23, 10:21 am - +260 97 7319106: Ok.
02/09/23, 10:21 am - +260 97 7319106: Yes
02/09/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case, may I know if you have any queries regarding the Early Decision Benefits still so that I can help you with that?
02/09/23, 10:25 am - +260 97 7319106: No that is understood
02/09/23, 11:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. May I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask please?

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
14/11/23, 6:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, with this payment that you made, I believe you did not include the transfer charges of the 5% that were to be included, right?

15/11/23, 9:22 pm - +260 97 7319106: Good evening thanks.. but according to the previous discussion i think the total amount was $353 and that's exactly what I have followed.. so if you can make me understand on that one
15/11/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is due to the fact that the day on which you made the payment, the exchange rate was so that the amount received here in India was not equal to the amount that you had paid. Therefore, the transfer charges are pending on the payment. I hope this is understood, right?
15/11/23, 9:47 pm - +260 97 7319106: Then was mislead.. meaning i have to look for the money

Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter.
