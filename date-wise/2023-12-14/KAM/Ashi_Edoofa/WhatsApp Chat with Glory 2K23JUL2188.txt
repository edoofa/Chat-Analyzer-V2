18/10/23, 10:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/10/23, 10:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/10/23, 10:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
18/10/23, 10:14 am - +265 992 07 25 73: I am not clear on "why you have chosen that particular university" I feel like the student may not know, needs guidance as he is not familiar with the universities .
18/10/23, 10:14 am - +265 992 07 25 73: Thats step no. 2
18/10/23, 10:29 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes, clear
18/10/23, 10:32 am - +265 994 39 93 32: She's asking on how you choose the university/college and how you make it familiar with the student being admitted
18/10/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification @265994399332, Let me inform you that we believe in making the university and college selection process as personalized and informative as possible. Once we've completed the process, We will apply your application to multiple universities that align with your academic goals and preferences.

The universities will then assess your application, considering your Statement of Purpose (SOP) and accompanying documents. Once they extend an offer, we will promptly share the offer letter with you. We will take the time to help you familiarize with each university's background, including their strengths, programs, faculty, and campus culture.

18/10/23, 1:06 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Sure, we can start
18/10/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/10/23, 1:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

18/10/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

18/10/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
18/10/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glory, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

18/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @265994399332
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Glory, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
18/10/23, 4:25 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes I do
18/10/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
18/10/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 10:00 PM. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

19/10/23, 10:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
19/10/23, 10:13 am - Ashi Edoofa: Although, Before we start our today's session, Kindly share these documents with us.
19/10/23, 10:14 am - +265 994 39 93 32: <Media omitted>

19/10/23, 10:17 am - +265 994 39 93 32: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the document with us @265994399332, Although your Junior Certificate of Education is pending, Please share the same.
19/10/23, 10:25 am - +265 994 39 93 32: I did not seat for junior certificate of education as I sat for my senior certificate of education in 2022 at first when the junior certificate was just being reintroduced, I decide to retake my senior certificate of education this year since I was not satisfied with the previous grades
19/10/23, 10:28 am - +265 992 07 25 73: The time Glory started secondary level the ministry of Education abolished Junior Certificate so the students were just writing Mala School Certificate of Education when completing fourth year.  That's why he did not write as there was no examination of Education department for JCE
19/10/23, 10:29 am - +265 992 07 25 73: The time Glory started secondary level the ministry of Education abolished Junior Certificate so the students were just writing Malawi School Certificate of Education when completing fourth year.  That's why he did not write as there was no examination of Education department for JCE
19/10/23, 10:29 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @265994399332,  To ensure there is no confusion in your academic history, I would recommend obtaining a document from your school that explicitly states you have successfully completed the Junior certificate of education, which is equivalent to the Junior Certificate of Education. This will help clarify your academic record and ensure that your qualifications are accurately represented.
19/10/23, 10:30 am - +265 992 07 25 73: This can be done we have to request the school to provide the document
19/10/23, 10:34 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @265992072573, You can request the document from the school and please do let us know their response.
19/10/23, 10:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (24th of October).
19/10/23, 10:38 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes
19/10/23, 10:42 am - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday/Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:
https://chat.whatsapp.com/EZjTaIgS23s04GoOqVK1lm
19/10/23, 10:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Glory Jana, and my EWYL group name is Glory EWYL23E0796. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (24th of October)to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
19/10/23, 10:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
19/10/23, 10:43 am - +265 992 07 25 73: Okay thanks
19/10/23, 10:47 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Ok, noted
19/10/23, 10:49 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/10/23, 10:50 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes that accurate
19/10/23, 10:50 am - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 10:50 am - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 10:50 am - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 10:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 10:52 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes, it is not possible indeed
19/10/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 11:03 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes, I remember him mentioning it
19/10/23, 11:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @265994399332. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 11:08 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes
19/10/23, 11:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
19/10/23, 11:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
19/10/23, 11:16 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes I have
19/10/23, 11:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
19/10/23, 11:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000 = $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $400 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/10/23, 11:22 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Ok, I understand
19/10/23, 11:25 am - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/10/23, 11:25 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/10/23, 11:25 am - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/10/23, 11:26 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Understood
19/10/23, 11:29 am - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 11:30 am - +265 994 39 93 32: No, there are no queries
19/10/23, 11:31 am - +265 992 07 25 73: On fees breakdown I have a question.  Since this is just an example do you have other scenarios whereby by the fees is contributory like subsidised somehow?  I have noted on accommodation.  What about meals?
19/10/23, 11:38 am - +265 992 07 25 73: Is the student suppose to come back home when the university closes (semester and/or annual)? I am asking considering that flight tickets are expensive also especially from Malawi.  If they don't come home what is the arrangement like during holidays?
19/10/23, 11:39 am - +265 992 07 25 73: Miss Ashi I think I skipped universities degree fees ranges in India I have seen now so  that's clear
19/10/23, 12:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you've found the information about universities' degree fees clear. As for returning home when the university closes, it depends on the university's academic calendar and your individual circumstances. You're right; flight tickets can be expensive, especially for international travel. Some students choose to stay on campus or in their study destination during holidays, while others may return home if they can.
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: Okay noted

19/10/23, 12:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 12:36 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes
19/10/23, 12:37 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: How many people did edooofa enroll in the 2023 batch?
19/10/23, 12:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @265994399332. More than 2000 edoofians have enrolled the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
19/10/23, 12:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.


Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/10/23, 12:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/10/23, 12:48 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Thank you
19/10/23, 12:49 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: So everyone arrives at the same time or how does it go exactly, and when they do arrive since not every student will be going to the same school how do they get there?
19/10/23, 12:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @265994399332 The students arrive in India in the batches according to their arrival dates which are shared by the University.
19/10/23, 12:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 12:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Noted
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Glory, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 12:55 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Oh, that a nice benefit
19/10/23, 12:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @265994399332
19/10/23, 12:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 12:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 1:00 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: I see
19/10/23, 1:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 1:02 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes it does, so such changes remain consistent for how long?
19/10/23, 1:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850 <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 1:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you? <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 1:08 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes
19/10/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 1:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 1:32 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes I've followed & there's nothing to inquire
19/10/23, 1:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 1:39 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: No, I do not have any
19/10/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @265994399332 in that case, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 1:48 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes Iam
19/10/23, 1:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to her chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
19/10/23, 1:51 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Sure

15/11/23, 7:37 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: We can go ahead with our discussions

15/11/23, 7:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 7:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
15/11/23, 7:51 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: The per unum fee after the scholarship is $350

Accommodation fee is $0

The annual fee is $1600

Sports and Misc fee are $125
Admission and processing fee is $1000
15/11/23, 7:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details @265994399332. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes it is
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Among the schools is this the only one that provided an offer letter or the others haven't responded yet?
15/11/23, 8:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me inform you @265994399332 that this is the first letter we have received for Glory, the university are processing  the offer letter now. We will share them once we received it.
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/11/23, 8:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: I see
15/11/23, 8:08 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes its clear
15/11/23, 8:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of you per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee

3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
15/11/23, 8:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: I've read the message
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established Name’s total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/11/23, 8:18 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes it's clear
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by your parents. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes it does
15/11/23, 8:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1600 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
15/11/23, 8:33 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes
15/11/23, 8:33 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: I see
15/11/23, 8:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,600. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,600 - $1,000 = $600 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
15/11/23, 8:49 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes its clear
15/11/23, 8:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
15/11/23, 8:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Glory through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 8:52 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes, would you kindly explain
15/11/23, 8:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 8:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Glory's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Tes its clear
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: Yes it is clear, is it possible to shift the dfealines to 30th November and 30th December? I am requesting this considering that as parents we rely on month end income , I know by 28th may be possible but let us not get chances extend with with days of which I am very much assured
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: We are in Malawi not Zimbabwe
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: In Malawi residing in Blantyre

15/11/23, 9:04 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: We appreciate the program for the support
15/11/23, 9:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, We understand regarding your concern however I would like to inform you that the deadline are shared by the University. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: I will use visa card as I did before
15/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @265992072573, Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?

18/11/23, 4:36 pm - +265 994 39 93 32: Ok, it would be good to get in touch with her
18/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For sure @265994399332, I'll share your details with her and she will contact you soon. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university.

18/11/23, 6:04 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: Another question
18/11/23, 6:05 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: Does it mean we will the get the official admission letter from University in December 2023 when we finish paying or we can get even after the initial payment?
18/11/23, 6:06 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: I am asking this considering that Glory needs to process visa as well
20/11/23, 8:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Glory, I hope you are doing well. 

Please excuse my inability to continue our discussion previously, I had to attend to an urgent call. By the time I became available, it was quite late on our end, and unfortunately, we couldn't reconnect. However, I am available today and have thoroughly reviewed the last message you shared.

On this note, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
20/11/23, 9:27 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Good Morning Ms. Ashi, I'm alright and I also hope that you are.
20/11/23, 9:28 am - +265 994 39 93 32: Yes we can move ahead with our discussion
20/11/23, 9:53 am - +265 992 07 25 73: Yes we can go ahead
20/11/23, 10:19 am - +265 992 07 25 73: Another question
20/11/23, 10:19 am - +265 992 07 25 73: I have seen Tuition and accommodation well explained
20/11/23, 10:20 am - +265 992 07 25 73: What about meals ?
20/11/23, 10:20 am - +265 992 07 25 73: Please give us more clarification
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing these details. Regarding the payment method, using the Visa card through our website is fine, and it's a secure way to process the transaction for the program. Once you make the payment of your fee, please ensure to share the following details along with a screenshot of the payment:

1. Remittance Bank [Name of Bank]:
2. Remitter Name [Account Holder Name]:
3. Remitter Country [Country from where the deposit has been made]:

This information is essential for us to confirm the payment with the accounts team and update the university officials accordingly.
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Also, I want to assure you that we have taken note of your request to amend Glory's home country to Malawi, and we have already notified the university to make the necessary correction.

Regarding the official offer letter, as per the last update we received, the university has indeed sent it to the email address you provided. Could you please confirm if you have received it? If not, we can request the university to resend the email. Additionally, to ensure timely communication, please provide an alternative email address in case there is any technical issue with your current email.
20/11/23, 2:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, let me attend to the third query shared by you regarding the official admission letter - The letter is issued by the university once a student completes all admission formalities, including the payment of the entire registration fee. If you wish to receive the letter early for visa application purposes, the sooner you complete the entire payment, the earlier we can assist you with the admission acceptance letter and proceed to the next stages of the process.
20/11/23, 2:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now coming to the last query you asked - As per the breakup of the fee shared by MVN University, food is not included in the services offered by the university and hence is not mentioned in the list. For the food, students have several options. They can choose to get food from outside, cook for themselves, opt for a meal plan, or use the university's food services. Rest assured, the student will receive guidance to choose the option that suits them best. I hope with this, all the queries that you have been addressed?

20/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @265992072573, I will look regarding the same please be assured
20/11/23, 2:52 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: Thank you
20/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome @265992072573
23/11/23, 4:26 am - +265 992 07 25 73: @~Ashi , Good morning.  We have not yet received the offer letter for Glory from the university.  We are checking our emails every day.  Please remind them as the days to settle the part registration fees are approaching.  I will need it to process the payment on 28th November.
23/11/23, 12:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Glory, I hope you are doing well.
23/11/23, 12:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing an update with us, Let me confirm the status of the document and why it has not been received on your end. Please allow me some time to coordinate with the university and address this concern.

I want to assure you that we are committed to ensuring a smooth and timely process for Glory's admission. In the meantime, it's worth mentioning that the offer letter you received we have shared is from the university itself and is identical to the one you would receive separately.
23/11/23, 1:49 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: I have noted what you have said.  But we had a concern that offer letter indicated Glory as from Zimbabwe not Malawi.  We want that to be amended to reflect Malawi.  In Malawi sending foreign currency is so much restrictive I will be needed to scan the offer as well and they can return it if its showing Zimbabwe they may think I am paying for someone staying in Zimbabwe
23/11/23, 1:50 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: I would appreciate if this would be amended and still please talk with the university to send us the offer through email we still have some days
23/11/23, 1:51 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: Or share their contacts so that we write them and copy you to show them that we really want them to send us the document in order to pay the admission fees
23/11/23, 1:52 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: As parents we appreciate your effort
23/11/23, 2:03 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @265992072573, We truly understand your point of view and please be assured that we are working with the officials and soon you will receive the letter from the university.
23/11/23, 4:54 pm - +265 992 07 25 73: Thank you
