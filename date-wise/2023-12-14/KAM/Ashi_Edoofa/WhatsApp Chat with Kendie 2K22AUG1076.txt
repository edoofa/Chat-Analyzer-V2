12/09/23, 4:18 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: This is so inspiring, I pray that Kendie will be among those in the next photo

Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
12/09/23, 4:21 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes it is correct
12/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

21/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kendie.

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with receiving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.
21/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265888012429 I would like to congratulate you and Kendie on this achievement 🌟

this is a really great achievement for Kendie and can be great for his higher education, I am sure you must be so proud of him.
21/09/23, 1:57 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes, we are and looking forward to seeing him appearing as one of your Edoofian in picture as above
21/09/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that @265888012429 even I am excited to meet Kendie, next year.
21/09/23, 2:09 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Thank you
21/09/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/09/23, 2:29 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes please
21/09/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 2:33 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: No problem, we can proceed
21/09/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
21/09/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
21/09/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
21/09/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
21/09/23, 2:37 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes, I know that cannot be possible or if one does then it can be cumbersome to study that way
21/09/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
21/09/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
21/09/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
21/09/23, 3:30 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes he did
21/09/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 3:35 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes please
21/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
21/09/23, 3:43 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: No clear yet. I thought if tuition and food and accommodation adds up to $2800 then it should be less $750?
21/09/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please let me help you understand further. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
21/09/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
21/09/23, 3:49 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: This is understood, however the payment duration is minimal but God is faithful we will make it
21/09/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that it must be a challenge to generate this amount in a short time and that is why we are informing you of an assumed amount before hand since you have almost a year's time to prepare for Kendie's higher education right now.

I hope we are clear here?
21/09/23, 4:18 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Oh ok noted thanks
21/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
21/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
21/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
21/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/09/23, 4:26 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: This is very clear, thanks
21/09/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/09/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/09/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/09/23, 4:55 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: This is very encouraging
21/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
22/09/23, 3:34 am - +265 888 01 24 29: Please explain well on #3 on Grant
25/09/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Kendie.

I hope you are doing well, since it was the weekend, hence we were unavailable to connect with you, so we will be connecting tomorrow at 02.00 pm.
26/09/23, 6:48 am - +265 888 01 24 29: No problem, thanks
05/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kendie.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 2:08 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes please. Sorry for the inconvenience that happened to you
05/10/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the concern, I am feeling better now, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 2:38 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes let's go ahead
05/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @265888012429 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 2:54 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: This is noted
05/10/23, 2:55 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: But I had a request above here
05/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, each an every grant will be explained to you please do not worry.
05/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving ahead with the next point.

2. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 2:56 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Ok noted thanks
05/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 2:58 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: I understand
05/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 3:03 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes please
05/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 3:10 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: I understand. However,  we have forex challenges here, this is a very big problem on our side
05/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern completely and there are many parents that go through the same, however, do not worry our team is here to assist you here also. Please do not worry.
05/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 3:17 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: What happens if we pay and the university does offer him a place
05/10/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265888012429 in that case, Kendie's seat with that university is reserved and then we shall wait for other offer letters from different universities. 

I hope we are clear?
05/10/23, 3:20 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Ok noted thanks
05/10/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. As Kendie's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Kendie is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 3:30 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes no problem
05/10/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 3:35 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: This sounds good. Do you have any students from Malawi we can also confirm that the process like this worked for them, so that our belief is strengthened
05/10/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265888012429 Greetings, yes please, however, I am heading for a meeting right now, so I will respond to the same as soon as I am done with my meeting. Thank you for understanding.
05/10/23, 3:47 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: No problem
05/10/23, 3:47 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: All the best
05/10/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you so much.
11/10/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kendie.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

11/10/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive.

12/10/23, 5:04 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Wow!
12/10/23, 5:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same on Saturday and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
12/10/23, 5:12 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Thank you so much when we have a discussion we will be able to come back to you. Thank you so much for your time

12/10/23, 5:13 pm - +265 881 30 48 45: Okay thank you
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kendie!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
16/10/23, 11:34 am - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes we did
16/10/23, 11:48 am - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
16/10/23, 11:51 am - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes we just need some clarification on accommodation do we have to pay 4 years in advance
16/10/23, 12:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please, you do not have to pay 4 years in advance. The accommodation fee will be required for one year at a time. This means that when you will arrive here in India, you would only have to pay for the first year's accommodation. I hope this is clear?
16/10/23, 12:08 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Ok noted thanks
16/10/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, on that note, I will make sure to connect you with the other students from Malawi who are already here in India. On that note, since you are asking for testimonies, may I know why is it that you need the same. Is there any concern please?
16/10/23, 5:27 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: No please it was just part of motivation to Kendie as the country is very far from home with a different culture and language
16/10/23, 6:32 pm - +265 996 37 96 30: Iyayi ingotumizan testimony yo Ka...komaso mwanayi akapita wat opportunities are there for him to source out the extra 1000usd that he is entitled to earn after working privately...what type of work will he be engaged in....thanks
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kendie!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is very true, and I completely understand your concern here. On that not, you can stay assured that there is a whole community of African students studying at Galgotias University from different countries such as Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia, etc. 

Therefore, you can stay assured that Kendie will surely feel it home here. I hope this is cleaR?
17/10/23, 12:07 pm - +265 881 30 48 45: We are doing well, I hope it's the same with you
17/10/23, 12:07 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Thanks but not very clear
17/10/23, 12:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, if I may ask what is it that is not clear please?
17/10/23, 12:25 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: We just simply wanted to hear some testimonies as Kendie is looking forward to go to a far country
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I have asked the concerned team to arrange the same and as soon as I will receive the same, I will let you know. Till then, shall we move ahead with our discussion here?
17/10/23, 4:29 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes please it's ok
17/10/23, 5:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, since the university has given you a date of 25th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
17/10/23, 6:44 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: We can manage the $300 payment if we manage to get more than that we will inform you
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kendie!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
18/10/23, 1:01 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: We are contacting banks but they have no forex will continue consulting once we have a breakthrough we will inform you
18/10/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Thank you for letting me know of that please. Keep me updated on the same.
18/10/23, 2:04 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: We will thanks
19/10/23, 9:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kendie!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:51 am - Milan Edoofa: I was just having a discussion with the accounts team regarding the forex challenges that you had mentioned earlier, and they have provided me with a possible solution to that please. May I know if you are available to discuss the same here?
19/10/23, 9:52 am - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes please.  Good morning
19/10/23, 10:00 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, the accounts team has shared the information that recent payments that we have received from Malawi came from FDH Bank and that they are processing forex payments without any concern. In that case, if I may ask would you be able to make the payment from that bank as well?
19/10/23, 10:01 am - +265 888 01 24 29: If they allow those who do not have an account with them now then no problem. Last time they wanted to open an account first. We go and inquire
19/10/23, 10:06 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, on that note, you can get in touch with them and know of the same. Otherwise, you can discuss the same with your bank as well and then let me know of that. <This message was edited>

24/10/23, 3:55 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: We have made payment with the bank but they have said it will take about 3 days to reflect since there is no forex
24/10/23, 4:12 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: <Media omitted>
24/10/23, 4:13 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Another payment has been made again for Kendie totalling to US$600 Now

24/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, can you please let me know of this as well?
24/10/23, 9:14 pm - +265 996 37 96 30: Wat do u mean
24/10/23, 9:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: I meant that for the first payment that you have shared here, you have only share the request for the payment that you made to the bank, what I require for making sure that the payment is noted with the accounts team is the Transfer Slip/Receipt of Payment from the Bank for the first payment please.
24/10/23, 9:22 pm - +265 996 37 96 30: Have u checked correctly that payments have been done in two ways? Firstly it's the 300 USD that NBS bank has debit from Kendies account. Coz of Forex we still in the funds transfer phase.. that is out of our hands now coz we've deposited oredy the Malawian currency that has to be changed to us dollar by the bank to Ur axis Bank account. So they say we wait till Friday or Monday next week. Something that again I say it's beyond our control..but we've managed to deposit before the deadline yes. So we continued to ask about any supporting documentation that can show proof that we deposited n we waiting for them to deposit in Ur account the aforesaid fees in dollar now. Thats y we sent the pdf file and also the jpg photo of the transactions that totals to 600$ thanks..which means 300$ proof shown...and then 300$ again left for NBS bank approval upon forex comes in
24/10/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right. On that note, wanted to know whether you received a deposit slip/transfer initiation slip from the bank for the first payment as well?
24/10/23, 10:04 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: I believe the bank did not give that slip. They just stamped the letter as an evidence that they have received the money instruction
24/10/23, 10:06 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Take note that these are 2 different banks and their transactions are different. If you do not receive the money in your account as advised we can use the letter they have stamped to follow up
24/10/23, 10:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, I would request you to connect with the bank from where you made the first payment and ask them for the Transaction Initiation Slip/Receipt as well in order for the payment to get confirmed.
24/10/23, 10:09 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: We will do that later since they have informed us to wait for forex
25/10/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kendie!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/10/23, 10:34 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that. Now, in order for us to be able to track your payments as well as note them with the accounts team, you would have to arrange the SWIFT Receipt for the same so that the payments can be confirmed.
25/10/23, 10:34 am - Milan Edoofa: About that, can you please let me know by when would you be able to fetch the same from the side of the Bank?
25/10/23, 3:44 pm - +265 996 37 96 30: No problem,we will do just that
25/10/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Have a blessed day ahead.
25/10/23, 6:43 pm - +265 996 37 96 30: Inuso
03/11/23, 10:25 am - +265 888 01 24 29: Greetings Milan, we consulted the bank today and they said they can only produce the bank slip once they've succeeded to deposit into your account. We will surely send the receipt once its made available to us. However, please confirm if you have received the other $300 dollars sent from National bank
03/11/23, 10:27 am - +265 888 01 24 29: <Media omitted>

03/11/23, 1:05 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Oh ok
14/11/23, 8:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kendie!
I hope this message finds you well. 

As per the discussion that we had here earlier regarding the pending payment for your registration fee, as discussed earlier, we kindly request you to provide us with the SWIFT receipt and reference details for the payment please. 

This information will help us ensure that the payment is appropriately processed and confirmed from the accounts team's side. Can you please let me know by when would you be able to share the same with me so that I can relay the same information to the accounts team as well?

21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents and Kendie!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
21/11/23, 9:47 am - +265 996 37 96 30: Is she already added in the group?
22/11/23, 8:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kendie,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I was recently reviewing your Scholarship Application File, and I observed that you have secured your scholarship seat with Quest University by paying your first part of the your registration fees which is $300, and the remaining amount for the same fee which is $300 is due by 25th November, 2023.

Since the deadline date is just around the corner, I wanted to reach out to you to understand the current status of your financial preparations for this crucial opportunity? Have you been able to raise the balance amount of $300 by now and finalize the date on when you are going to make the payment of your fee?
22/11/23, 8:55 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Welcome Ashi. The name of the University you've mentioned is strange to us. This University was not mentioned to us. Can you shed more light
22/11/23, 9:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me @265888012429, as I have shared the wrong university name with you. Your University is Galgotias University, thank you for highlighting the same.
22/11/23, 9:08 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: You're welcome
22/11/23, 9:09 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: We have a problem with forex we deposited the money. We don't know what to do
23/11/23, 12:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kendie, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for sharing your concern with us, as you have mentioned that you have deposited the money I believe in that case you must be assisted with the transaction slip as well, Could you please share the same with us ?
23/11/23, 1:51 pm - +265 996 37 96 30: @265888012429 respond
23/11/23, 2:18 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: The bank said they can not provide it before the money is deposited into the bank account. So we are stuck
23/11/23, 2:18 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: There is no forex
24/11/23, 3:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kendie, Wishing you a good day!

Alright dear, we do understand your concern with this in mind May I please know by when do you anticipate that you will be able to share an update with us?
24/11/23, 5:07 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Next week please
24/11/23, 5:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @265888012429, Thank you for sharing your response with us, please make sure to share an update with us.
24/11/23, 5:09 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Will do that, so stressful indeed
24/11/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your situation @265888012429, please don't take stress we are here for you always.
24/11/23, 5:24 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Okay
24/11/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Wishing you a wonderful weekend and please extend our regards to your family as well!
24/11/23, 5:30 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Same to you thank you
27/11/23, 10:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kendie, I hope you are doing well. 

As per the discussion that we had here earlier, Could you please let me know if you have collected the swift receipt from the bank?
27/11/23, 10:46 pm - +265 996 37 96 30: @265888012429
28/11/23, 10:03 am - +265 888 01 24 29: It is so stressful that we're unable to move forward. I suggest we step down from the process as there is nothing we can do about it.

Will we please be refunded the $300. We may start all over again when situation is favourable
28/11/23, 10:08 am - +265 996 37 96 30: This is due to the devaluation our country has faced..44% ..
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kendie, I hope you are doing well. 

While I understand you situation, It is important to remember that when it comes to pursuing education abroad, determination plays a significant role. The challenges you have encountered are not unique, as many students have faced similar difficulties, particularly given the current economic conditions.
28/11/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The economy in Malawi has been experiencing various challenges, making it tough for students who aspire to further their education. This is why many students have chosen to study in India.
28/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The rationale behind this decision is that pursuing education in India offers a brighter future. If they were to study in Malawi under the same economic conditions, it might not provide them with the best opportunities for their personal and professional growth. Thus, it's a strategic move for their future careers. Can you relate to this perspective?
28/11/23, 12:49 pm - +265 996 37 96 30: True
28/11/23, 12:50 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: But we have missed the deadline
28/11/23, 1:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We understand your thoughts @265888012429, but we want to understand what challenges you are having which has lead you in this situation?
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: We made 2 transactions using two different banks the NBS Bank and National Bank. The NBS Bank transaction went through but the National Bank transaction did not. And now the big obstacle is that the one who did the National Bank transaction is currently very sick and has been flown to South Africa there is no way we can engage him to pursue the Bank further until he gets well. Now that's where we are stuck🤦🏽‍♀️ <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know @265888012429, If I am correct you have made one transaction in the month of October and other one in the month of November. According to the accounts team, we have received the confirmation for the transaction made in November. Could you please let me know if you have made a transaction from National Bank transaction in October?
28/11/23, 1:32 pm - +265 888 01 24 29: Yes the request was made on 23rd October
