14/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Available
14/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you were able to go through the image shared above?
14/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes i did
14/09/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/09/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/09/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Very clear
14/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes i am
14/09/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/09/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/09/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Very clear
14/09/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/09/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
14/09/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/09/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/09/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
14/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes please
14/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
14/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

14/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
14/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
14/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
14/09/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Today around 1900hrs
14/09/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
14/09/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 951 0242: I will be fully available
14/09/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
14/09/23, 8:42 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes i did
14/09/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
14/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 951 0242: I have understood that the Edoofa expect us students to be teachable and also to follow instructions and it increases our capacity for success making us more responsible and independent. It also guide us to be eligible during the admission process and it helps us to create our statement of purpose
14/09/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/09/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/09/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
14/09/23, 8:51 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
14/09/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
14/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Ok
14/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
14/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

15/09/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 951 0242: 2. Explain about BPM (Business Process Management) life cycle?

It is a framework that provides a standard approach to designing, implementing and managing business processes. 

To begin with,  Planning and strategic alignment it involves gaining a deep understanding of how processes are aligned with the chain through organisation profiling

Moving on,  Analysis- it is practised so as to get a complete picture on the nature of the business and how processes are being executed

Also Designing is when information from the analysis are put to use and one has to be aware of delays in detail.

Therefore after design process there is the implementing process whereby one has to use either the systematic or non systematic implementation to implement the design. However the choice is made depending on the nature and resources available to .

We move on to Monitoring where one is supposed to track, measure and control the key perfomance indicators on a continuous basis. The information gathered is then used to gauge if the process needs any changes and also if the designed process is meeting its goals.

Lastly, there is the refinement process where one makes the effort to close the margin between current perfomance and the modeled process with carefully measured changes.
15/09/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 951 0242: 3. How does business contribute to economic development? Please elaborate and state
with an example.

To start with, business is important to the economic development as it raises standard of living. It can greatly enhance the standard of living for individuals and communities by setting up industries and creating new jobs. For instance the road rehabilitation in my town has helped many people as they got jobs.

Also, businesses can be a path to economic independence as it reduces the nation's dependence on imported goods and services promoting self reliance. Instead  manufactured goods and services can be exported to other foreign markets leading to expansion, currency in-flow and economic independence.

Businesses identify market needs and develop solutions through their products and services by starting new firms and businesses. It plays an important role in shaping the economy and creating more dynamic and diverse business landscape. Also it promotes innovation and competition leading to new and improved products and services that contribute to economic growth and development.

Lastly business can play a key role in increasing economic growth and prosperity by increasing Gross National Product and Per Capita Income and it leads to increased consumer spending and higher tax revenue.
15/09/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 951 0242: 4. Explain with an example from your life which shows your managerial talent/skill

I am currently working as a Sales Assistant at Okmart chivhu and its a job which also requires some managerial skills such as being decisive, delegating tasks, relationship management and IT Skills.

When i began my work i had a lot to learn since i was new to the environment and i managed to adapt quickly and i pleased my managers now am sometimes given the task to delegate tasks to my co-workers in our department without any challenges.

Also since i have got some computer skills i have an added advantage which i now use when it comes to operating the system and software used by our company and i can create orders for our suppliers to bring products and also to write morning huddles which we use to represent whether the previous day we managed to reach our targets and also solutions to some of the problems as a branch we might be having.

I also remember during my high school years i once became a class rep and i would organise seminars with other schools and we would do it without the presents of our teachers sometimes and sometimes i would collaborate with my peers to start projects such as Car wash to raise funds which we would use to by recycle bins used at school or we would visit different orphanage schools with gifts.
15/09/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 951 0242: 5.Explain the importance of human resources in an organisation?

Human resources handles different aspects of hiring employee rectuitment, training, benefits, and writing handbooks for employees.

Also human resources manage all the steps of hiring, making offers, negotiating contracts and getting the requiref paperwork. They are also responsible for the recommendation on what salary to offer to their employees and provide guidance to the hiring managers which is important for the company.

15/09/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes please
15/09/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
15/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Am ready
15/09/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
15/09/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
15/09/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
15/09/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
15/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
15/09/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
15/09/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
15/09/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
15/09/23, 8:40 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Correct💯
15/09/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
15/09/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes we are on the same page
15/09/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we are on the same page. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
15/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes please
15/09/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
15/09/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
15/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Ok
15/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
15/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
15/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
15/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
15/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 71 951 0242: No questions
15/09/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Grea, Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
15/09/23, 9:12 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
15/09/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
15/09/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
15/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 71 951 0242: It is
15/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
15/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes please
16/09/23, 8:33 am - +263 71 951 0242: Good morning... i have a question for you  do i have to pay all these fees this year for example the 750
16/09/23, 8:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for your query, let me help you understand, As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee which is the $750 that you are referring to, This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.

I hope we are clear now?
16/09/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 951 0242: Yes , i wanted to ask that am i paying it this year or next year or am will be reserving my seat before. This year ends
16/09/23, 8:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: @263719510242 I completely understand your question here, please be assured as we move ahead with our discussion everything will be covered, and you shall get the clarity too. So may I know if you are available to connect now?
16/09/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 951 0242: Am available
16/09/23, 8:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
16/09/23, 8:56 am - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
16/09/23, 8:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
16/09/23, 8:59 am - +263 71 951 0242: No
16/09/23, 9:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
16/09/23, 9:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
16/09/23, 9:01 am - +263 71 951 0242: Done
16/09/23, 9:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
16/09/23, 9:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
16/09/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 951 0242: Ok
16/09/23, 9:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.
16/09/23, 9:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.
16/09/23, 9:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
16/09/23, 9:08 am - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
16/09/23, 9:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: 3. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
16/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
16/09/23, 9:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: 4. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving an option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 30th August 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 30th August 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 30th September 2023. Any queries so far?
16/09/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 951 0242: No
16/09/23, 9:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
16/09/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 951 0242: Very clear
16/09/23, 9:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
16/09/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 951 0242: Lets wait for them to catch up
16/09/23, 9:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed , @263719510242 may I know by when will they be available to connect with us?
16/09/23, 9:53 am - +263 71 951 0242: Ok
17/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 569 1221: How are you,had network challenge
18/09/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Good evening,am now available.
18/09/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well and had a fruitful weekend, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Available
18/09/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. I hope you were able to have a discussion as a family by now so I'm interested in knowing how the discussion went regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously?
18/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 951 0242: We are on board with it
18/09/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
18/09/23, 8:39 pm - +263 71 951 0242: They are available
18/09/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Please go ahead
18/09/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
18/09/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
18/09/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
18/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 569 1221: We are on the same page, please go ahead
18/09/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
18/09/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
18/09/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
18/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Clear
18/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Clear
18/09/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
18/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Sure
18/09/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 18th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 03rd of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
18/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Yes
18/09/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
18/09/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
18/09/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 18th of September, the deadline becomes the 03rd of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 18th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 03rd of October 2023, making the second deadline the 03rd of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
18/09/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Yes
18/09/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
18/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Go ahead please
18/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
18/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 71 951 0242: When i receive the admission letter from the universities

Proceed as per the standard procedures $750 within 15 days after recieving the letter

Proceed with the early  
Decision Benefits $600 split into 2 installments
18/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
18/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Clear
18/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
18/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *03rd October* and *03rd November*.
18/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *03rd of October and 03rd of November*), can you give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Takudzwa's  application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
18/09/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Please go ahead
18/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Takudzwa's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *03rd of October and 03rd of November*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
18/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Sure
18/09/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Takudzwa's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Takuzwa's  higher education well.
20/09/23, 8:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University.

20/09/23, 8:04 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
20/09/23, 8:04 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 9:12 am - +263 71 951 0242: So are there other universities that might offer me
20/09/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that Takudzwa, stay assured that I will be helping you with all the queries that you have during the discussion that we will have further. 

For now, it becomes my responsibility to make sure that you can have proper clarity and understanding of the letter. For me to be able to do that, may I know if you have been through the letter by now?
20/09/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes i have
20/09/23, 12:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 951 0242: 1. $900
2. 3 years
3. $300
4. $750 <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Takudzwa, in question number one, you have to share your per semester fee after scholarship dear, please take a look at the letter once again carefully and then let me know of that.
20/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 951 0242: 1. $900
2. 3 years
3. $300
4. $750
20/09/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes please
20/09/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Ok
21/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting that came up. Now, I appreciate your patience here and let us move ahead with our discussion here.
21/09/23, 10:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead let me also inform you that Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
21/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 71 951 0242: Yes please
21/09/23, 10:50 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
21/09/23, 10:51 am - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
21/09/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
21/09/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 951 0242: Very clear
21/09/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
21/09/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
21/09/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
21/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 951 0242: Am clear
21/09/23, 11:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/09/23, 11:10 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/09/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 951 0242: Chivhu
21/09/23, 11:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/09/23, 11:14 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/09/23, 11:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/09/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 951 0242: Ok thank you
21/09/23, 11:23 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
21/09/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 951 0242: If i give mr rajan the cash will i give him the exact amount or there are charges applied
21/09/23, 11:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Takudzwa, as I had already mentioed, while making the payment in cash through Mr. Rajan, the international transfer charges of 7% would be applicable please. I hope this is clear?
21/09/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 951 0242: Yes its clear
21/09/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 951 0242: So how much will i give him
21/09/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 951 0242: 300 + ???
21/09/23, 11:33 am - Milan Edoofa: It would be $321 to be paid exactly please. I hope this is clear, right?
21/09/23, 11:33 am - +263 71 951 0242: I have understood now
21/09/23, 11:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, shall I share Mr. Charles's details with you here as well dear?
21/09/23, 11:35 am - +263 71 951 0242: Its ok
21/09/23, 11:37 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
22/09/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263719510242 May I know if you have taken a note of the account details that I have shared above so that we can move ahead with our discussion here?
22/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 951 0242: How are you
22/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes i have
22/09/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
22/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Ok thank you
22/09/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
22/09/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
24/09/23, 7:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/09/23, 7:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side on this earlier when we were having a discussion here. However, I believe due to some challenges that you had faced, you were not able to respond on time. Now, can you please go through the messages I have shared above once and then let me know if you are clear till there?
24/09/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 951 0242: I understood
24/09/23, 8:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, @263719510242 if I may ask is everything alright, since you were not responding to me earlier?
24/09/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Network problems
24/09/23, 8:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Oh, I believe it must have been sorted by now so that we can move ahead, right?
24/09/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes please
24/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Are there any other offers from other universities
24/09/23, 8:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are following till here?
24/09/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 951 0242: How about Lovely Professional University
24/09/23, 8:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, can you please also let me know why is it that you are inclined towards LPU and where did you get to know about that?
24/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 951 0242: I have been following LPU on social media and i was interested in their activities
24/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 951 0242: They have a soccer team which i am quiet interested in
24/09/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please.
24/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Welcome
24/09/23, 9:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities including LPU. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
24/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes please thank you
24/09/23, 9:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
24/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 71 951 0242: No
24/09/23, 9:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship. <This message was edited>
24/09/23, 9:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
24/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
24/09/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear about the query that you had about the multiple offer letters and do you now have clarity on how will your admission be processed?
24/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes its clear
24/09/23, 9:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, shall we proceed from here?
24/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
25/09/23, 7:48 am - +263 77 569 1221: It's clear, proceed please
26/09/23, 10:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/09/23, 10:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
26/09/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 569 1221: Ok,
26/09/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
26/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Please go ahead
26/09/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
26/09/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

27/09/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, and if I may ask what were your parents's thoughts on the same?

27/09/23, 4:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: I find it reassuring that your parents have such thoughts and this ensures that your career is on the right path and that they're well-prepared to support you. Following your discussion with your family about the offer letter, do you have any questions or concerns that you would like us to address?
27/09/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 951 0242: No
28/09/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: If you have any questions or require any help, feel free to bring them up and share them with us here. We can discuss them and assist you in planning for your child's education.
28/09/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: I hope that you have discussed with your family the registration fee, payment deadlines, and mode of payment and that you have also taken note of these important details since they are crucial in reserving your scholarship seat right?
28/09/23, 10:11 am - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
28/09/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 569 1221: Good morning.So far everything is in line. Should any query arise,we will raise it to you.
28/09/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. May I know if you are planning to make the payment of your fee in one part of $600 to complete the process early or in two parts of $300 as per the due dates shared by the university so that we can pass the same information to them?
28/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 951 0242: In 2 parts
28/09/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand and you can surely do that, and I will inform the university authorities about our conversation today. It seems that you are taking the appropriate steps toward financing your education and should reserve your scholarship seat soon. Additionally, could you please inform me of the date when you intend to pay your fees?
28/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Not sure at the moment but definitely before 4 October 2023.
28/09/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know. I will update the university officials as well. We are done with our sessions for now and since you now have an offer letter with you, the next step for you is to pay your university registration fee as per the deadline shared and reserve the scholarship seat.
						
After making the payment, kindly send us the receipt so that we can confirm it with the accounts team and inform the university officials. Don't hesitate to contact us if you require any assistance.
28/09/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: That being said, we will end our conversation for today. Have a wonderful day and please convey our greetings to your family as well!
28/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 569 1221: Thank you
02/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Good day
02/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Can i ask what my remaining balance is???
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per the offer letter that you have rteceived from the side of the university, the current amount that is due towards Takudzwa's registration fee is $300 that is to be paid on or before 04th October 2023 please. May I know if that is clear>
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes please
03/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Are there any other offers yet
03/10/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are clear till here, right?
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes i have understood
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
03/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Very clear
03/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 951 0242: So what will happen if i dont meet the current deadline
03/10/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that? <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Is there any possibility that i might fail to find other universities
03/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes
03/10/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, that would not be possible please. Now, Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
03/10/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
03/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 951 0242: What if i choose to wait for other universities  without paying for now
03/10/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: In this case, declining the scholarship from Galgotias University means you will forfeit the opportunity to secure that scholarship in the future. It's important to consider that we have also submitted your application to other universities, but their responses are not guaranteed at this point. There's no assurance that you will receive an offer letter from all of these universities.

Let's imagine a scenario where you receive another offer letter from a different university, but then realize that the Galgotias offer was actually more favorable. By that time, you may have already lost your seat at Galgotias, and it would no longer be an option for you.
03/10/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's why we want to introduce you to the transfer option. This allows you to secure your seat at Galgotias University now and, based on the responses you receive later from other universities, you can make an informed decision about whether to transfer your seat from one university to another.

By opting for this transfer option, you keep the door open for multiple opportunities and ensure you have a seat reserved at Galgotias while you explore your other choices. I hope you understand this?
03/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Ok
03/10/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you were able to understand the important of securing the scholarship seat, right?
03/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 951 0242: Yes please
04/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 951 0242: EcoCash: Cash In Confirmation:Received USD313 from 031784-SPIUS BERE.Approval Code: CI231004.0936.F87498. Fee: 0. New balance:USD757.77.

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

Firstly, I am delighted to inform you that the payment you have made for the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly in order to ensure a seamless transition in your application process.
13/12/23, 9:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
13/12/23, 9:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
13/12/23, 9:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
