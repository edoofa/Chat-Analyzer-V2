29/08/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes thank you
29/08/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
29/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Ok thank you
29/08/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
29/08/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

30/08/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 653 5194: 2: the difference between rights and duties are that right is a power or claim possessed by an individual to do something while duty is an obligation to do or omit to do something. To add rights gives a person freedom as one free from different things. Whilist a duties limits a person's freedom as it is what one has to do whether you like or not.About human rights and civil rights, human rights are fundamentals rights. They include the right to life, education and fair trial. They are also considered to be necessities of the human existence. Civil rights on the other hand are those rights that one enjoys by virtue of citizenship in a particular nation. Civil rights protect citizens from discrimination and grant certain freedoms like free speech, due process, etc.
30/08/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 653 5194: It will be done am working on it
30/08/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response.
30/08/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Number3: The difference between prosecutor and an attorney are that an attorney is only allowed to defend against federal charges, they must be admitted to practise law on federal level. While a prosecutor handle criminal defence cases that cross state lines or occur on federally-owned land and can work in tandem with state prosecutors on the same case. Some examples include drug trafficking and cyber crimes. A prosecutor also represents the interest of public safety working to prove or group has committed a crime and deserves to be punished whereas the attorney represents the client's best interests of legal proceedings to sentencing

30/08/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Good evening
30/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
30/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
30/08/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Ok thank you
30/08/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
30/08/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Ok
30/08/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes its true
30/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
30/08/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes am ready
30/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
30/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
30/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
30/08/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes its not possible
30/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
30/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
30/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
30/08/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes we discussed about it
30/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
30/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes l get it
30/08/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
30/08/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes its clear
30/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
30/08/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes l understand
30/08/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
30/08/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 653 5194: So far l have nothing to ask l understand bt l will ask if l find anything
30/08/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Moving forward, I recently reviewed your application form once again and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in August 2023. Considering the fact that we start with the EWYL on Monday as informed to you before, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Monday which is 4th September 2023.
30/08/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
30/08/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our discussion for Friday at 01.00 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this discussion. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
30/08/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Ok thank you.
30/08/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Ok l will inform them
30/08/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, Have a great night, and convey my regards to your family as well.
30/08/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Ok its noted
30/08/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Same to you to.
30/08/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
01/09/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Good afternoon
01/09/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know the same, I hope you have a wonderful journey ahead with your Mentor!
01/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 653 5194: I hope so too
01/09/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand more. 

2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
01/09/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
01/09/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes
01/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
01/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes its clear
01/09/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
01/09/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
01/09/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
01/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 653 5194: No am ok
01/09/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
01/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 653 5194: I would like you ti give me more information
01/09/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
01/09/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
01/09/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
01/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes its good
01/09/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
01/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes
02/09/23, 7:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Deborah.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded, it was past our available hours, so we were unable to get back to you, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
02/09/23, 8:29 am - +263 78 281 3872: yes I am
02/09/23, 8:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you were clear hear?
02/09/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 281 3872: yes I'm clear
02/09/23, 8:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, now I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
02/09/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 281 3872: yes. I agree
02/09/23, 8:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: So, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once her results come in 2024, she will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue her bachelor's degree then.
02/09/23, 8:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for 
another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
02/09/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 281 3872: yeah this is a fair deal. I like this
02/09/23, 9:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263782813872 now moving forward.

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for her exams and starting with her Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
02/09/23, 9:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
02/09/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 281 3872: Ok. How long does it take to study for a deploma course in India？
02/09/23, 9:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand, Diploma courses are also for 3-year courses.
02/09/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 281 3872: Alright. I clear
02/09/23, 9:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263782813872 Now, let us move forward to the last point.

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career. Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program.

06/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes we can g aheaf
06/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand that network can be a challenge, in that case, do you want to continue with the discussion right now, considering the network challenges?
06/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 653 5194: Yes we can go ahead
06/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 281 3872: We can continue. Good Evening
06/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 913 8515: Yes we can continue
06/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 594 8649: Good evening
06/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now I hope you were able to have a discussion as a family by now so I'm interested in knowing how the discussion went regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously?
06/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 594 8649: The discussion was really good and we have understand it and it's benefits
06/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
06/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
06/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
06/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 594 8649: Yes we are on the same page
06/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
06/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
06/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
06/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 594 8649: And about the university process they give a go_ ahead once they are ready right so how long should we take to start the process
06/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 594 8649: Ok
06/09/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263715948649 I understand that you are excited about Deborah's admission process, however, please be patient as each and everything will be explained to you in detail, now, If we are clear shall we move ahead?
06/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 594 8649: Yes we can go ahead
06/09/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
06/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 281 3872: yes.
06/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 06th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 21st of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this? <This message was edited>
06/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 71 594 8649: Yes
06/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
06/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
06/09/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 06th of January, the deadline becomes the 21st of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 06th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 21st of September 2023, making the second deadline the 21st of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
06/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 281 3872: It's clear
06/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 78 281 3872: We are together.
06/09/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
06/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 281 3872: Very clear.
06/09/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
06/09/23, 10:21 pm - +263 71 594 8649: Am l to give as per the dates you gave or when exact we would like admission process to stary
06/09/23, 10:21 pm - +263 71 594 8649: Start
06/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: These are the tentative dates, once you decide, with which admission process you wish to continue ahead, and when you give us a go ahead, we will send Deborah's application to the universities, once the university generates the offer letter, you will be required to pay according to the deadline given as per the offer letter. 

I hope we are clear here?
06/09/23, 10:25 pm - +263 71 594 8649: Ok
06/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
06/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 71 594 8649: The admission process will begin once the parents gives a go ahead of it and the admission process can proceed as per the standard procedures and with the Early Decision Benefits.The registration fee is from 500 to 750 dollars. The deadline is within 15 days
06/09/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
06/09/23, 10:43 pm - +263 71 594 8649: Yes am clear
06/09/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
06/09/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *21st September* and *21st October*. <This message was edited>
06/09/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines (*21st September* and *21st October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Deborah's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board? <This message was edited>
06/09/23, 10:51 pm - +263 71 594 8649: Ok let's first discuss with the rest of the family
06/09/23, 10:52 pm - +263 78 281 3872: I understood that there are 2 ways of regestration，that is Standared procedure and early regestration procedure.
 Under standared procedure one is required to pay the full amount of regestration fee within a period of 15 days once one has received an offer latter fron the university. For instance if the I get the offer letter on 10 September 2023 the payment deadline will be the 25th of Septemper 2023.

Early Regestration is acompanied with an early decison grant which can be paid by tne Edoofa on behalve of the student. The student is r required to pay the  remaining regestration fee in a more flexible way. The first halve of tje remaining fee is paid within15 days the the other part will be paid within 4 weeks from the dead line. For example，if The regestraion fee is 750 the garant is 300. This means the Edoofa board will pay for me 300 and the remaining amount will be 450. This means I will pay 225 within 15 day from the day I receive my offer letter. then the remaining balance must be paid within 30 days.
06/09/23, 11:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263782813872 I can see you have understood the process, however, let me help you understand the Early decision benefits, A grant of $150 will be given by Edoofa, and the rest $600 registration fee can be paid in two parts of $300 for example, if the offer letter is issued by 06th September within the first 15 days $300 will be required to pay, which is on 21st September and the remaining $300 within a month that is on 21st october 2023.

I hope you are clear now?
06/09/23, 11:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is completely fine, in that case, we shall reconnect tomorrow at 02.00 p.m. I hope you will be available and will be able to have a discussion with the rest of the family, regarding the same.
07/09/23, 8:08 am - +263 78 281 3872: Thank you
08/09/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 281 3872: Morning. Yes we are cumfortable. You can proceed to prepare Deborah's application for the early decison.
08/09/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Deborah.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that. Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Name’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *21st September* and *21st October*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
08/09/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 281 3872: Yes we are.
08/09/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Deborah's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Deborah's higher education well.
08/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 281 3872: Ok. thank you. For now all is fine with us
08/09/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome @263782813872 . 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?

21/09/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 320 5787: Network error
21/09/23, 11:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a five-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 10 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
21/09/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 320 5787: Yes we are clear
21/09/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
21/09/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
21/09/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
21/09/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 320 5787: Three seater meaning 3 student's can share that 2000 us
21/09/23, 11:30 am - Milan Edoofa: No, please Deborah, this means that all the three students have to pay the $2000 per annum accommodation costs dear. I hope this is clear?
21/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 320 5787: Yes it's clear
21/09/23, 11:37 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
21/09/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 320 5787: We are together inside campus truely needs a lot of money
21/09/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
21/09/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 320 5787: I ,m clear
21/09/23, 11:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
21/09/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 320 5787: Clear ,what about 150 us benefits from early registration paid by school
21/09/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
21/09/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*

21/09/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 320 5787: What about if I am not well prepared
21/09/23, 11:51 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case, you have this option with you to make the payment in two parts within a span of 45 days please. I believe it would help you a lot in terms of preparation, right?
21/09/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 320 5787: Ok
21/09/23, 11:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/09/23, 11:54 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/09/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 320 5787: Chiredzi
21/09/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/09/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/09/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)

21/09/23, 12:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
21/09/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Yes
21/09/23, 12:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/09/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Ok
21/09/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 320 5787: May l know please let me know after paying this 750 us is there any stage which needs money from us with a short period in this year or
21/09/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please once the registration would be paid, there would be no other monetary requirements that has to be fulfilled within this year. Once the admission would be completed all the balance fee would be required in the coming year 2024. Is that clear?
21/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Yes it's clear
21/09/23, 4:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
21/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Ok thank u
21/09/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/09/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/09/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Clear
21/09/23, 4:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
21/09/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Yaa I see
22/09/23, 1:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Deborah!

22/09/23, 1:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
22/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Everything is clear let's move on
22/09/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

24/09/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
24/09/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Yes
24/09/23, 9:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
24/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 320 5787: Yes I see
24/09/23, 9:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
24/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 320 5787: No let's move on
24/09/23, 9:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
24/09/23, 9:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications). <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
13/12/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
13/12/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
