I hope you are doing well today.

I am Mr. Milan, Senior admissions officer here at Edoofa. I was going through the discussion that you were having with Mr. Rithvik and I came to notice that you were facing some financial challenges due to which you were planning to withdraw from the program. Hence, I wanted to have a discussion with you regarding the same, so, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other for the same?
24/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 277 1213: Okay we will let you know

24/08/23, 12:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Kelvin, I was going through the discussion that you were having with Mr. Rithvik where you mentioned that due to lack of funds, you are finding it difficult to come to India and start with your higher education, is that right?
24/08/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 115 1578: That's correct.
24/08/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, in that case, can you please first help me in understanding more about the challenges that you are facing?
24/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 115 1578: Right, attaining the first semester fee was possible but to consistently pay all of the tuition costs proved rather difficult. Most of the funds that were to finance my education for just the first semester were obtained through loan realization, obtaining any further funds for the coming education period would prove difficult as we shall be paying for the first semester loan from where we borrowed the money. To some it all, it is a financial issue rather.
24/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 115 1578: In addition I would like assistance in the refund process for the money I had already paid for?
28/08/23, 12:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kelvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/08/23, 12:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that dear. Now, from what you have mentioned here, I have completely understood about the situation that you are facing and I am completely ready to help you with that, please. 

Now, before we come to the issue of refund, can you please help me in understanding that if not here in India, how would you be moving ahead with your higher education Kelvin?
28/08/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 115 1578: Sure thing Mr Singh, we are humbled to inform you that if and only if there are other lesser than expensive methods of attaining higher education in any foreign land and India included, we would gladly partake in the endeavor. However due to the current circumstances, I, Kelvin Muputa will be continuing with my higher education in my home country, Zimbabwe. That's if nothing changes of sort.
31/08/23, 8:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kelvin!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/08/23, 8:45 am - Milan Edoofa: In that sitation, can you please also help me in understanding more about how much is it that you can cater for Kelvin's higher education?

On that note, I do have something to discuss with you, may I know by when can we connect with each other for the same?

The end goal of partaking thus course is to be able to further my tertiary education with me studying a program known as paraplanning, from there onwards all desired set goals will render possible.

05/09/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's a thoughtful approach, Kelvin. Exploring different options is always a wise decision when it comes to higher education. Considering your interest in the commercial world and your desire for financial freedom, I'd like to introduce you to another program that aligns with these goals.

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 7:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
13/12/23, 7:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
13/12/23, 7:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
13/12/23, 7:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
13/12/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 115 1578: My thanks to the Admission officer for the update. Unfortunately I had already enrolled in a college here in Zimbabwe and would like to request a refund on the tuition currently paid, but given that the one of the concerned Universities do accept me and offering a much flexible cost of education, iam willing to reconsider. Thank you very much.
13/12/23, 9:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263781151578, I am happy to hear that you are looking forward for new opportunities. With this we wish you a blessed night
13/12/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 115 1578: Goodnight
