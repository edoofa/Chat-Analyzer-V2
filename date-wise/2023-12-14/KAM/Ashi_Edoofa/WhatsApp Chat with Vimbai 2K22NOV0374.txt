Vimbai is currently at school until 16 November that's when she will be done with her final examinations, so between now and 16 November she will not have access to her mobile phone therefore currently unavailable.
06/09/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand now. Thank you for sharing the information with me in advance. I recognize that attending school might pose challenges for Vimbai’s participation. I would like both you and Vimbai to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and our sessions can also involve only parents at times.
06/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well noted and much appreciated Mr Shivjeet. Thank you.

Given our strong enthusiasm and meticulous preparation to advance your admission process, I would greatly appreciate your confirmation of your readiness to embark on this journey. So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
06/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 247 6942: We are well prepared to initiate the admission process sir.
06/09/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply. That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
06/09/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Confirmed the information you have is correct Mr Shivjeet.
06/09/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

06/09/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 247 6942: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 247 6942: For A Level results they are not yet available as she is sitting for these examinations in October to November. The statement of entry she has it at school and we do not have means of communication with her as she does not take her mobile with her
06/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know if there is any chance that she can share the Statement of Entry with us?
06/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well noted sir, we will try to talk to the headmaster tomorrow and ask for the same. Thank you.
06/09/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That would be great. We shall wait for the document together.
06/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Thank you sir.
06/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 247 6942: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 247 6942: <Media omitted>

06/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 247 6942: I have sent the statement of entry for Vimbai
06/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Confirmed we reme.ber the previous discissions we may proceed
06/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
06/09/23, 10:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it was a long day for me and our available hours have ended. I would like us to reconnect again tomorrow, please. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
06/09/23, 10:40 pm - +263 77 247 6942: My understanding of the fourth stage is that it is about Vimbai getting an offer letter from a university/universities that are willing to offer her a place to study her programe at their school. The university will then confirm the type of scholarship they are awarding her and she has to choose and accept the university she is comfortable with.
06/09/23, 10:40 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well noted and thank you sir. Good night.
07/09/23, 2:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
07/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Not quite certain sir, is this referring to the EWYL programe
07/09/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is not and we shall come to details soon. So, shall we proceed ?
07/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure we can proceed sir
07/09/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
07/09/23, 3:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
07/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well understood sir and much appreciated, thank you Edoofa
07/09/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
07/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir i am interested in this opportunity so you can go ahead and share more
07/09/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
07/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 247 6942: No sir i was not aware of that
07/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, Kindly excuse me for the delay in responding; our availability for the first slot has just concluded.
07/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
07/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
07/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
07/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
07/09/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir, i have gone through the benefits, we may proceed
07/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
07/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
08/09/23, 4:38 am - +263 77 247 6942: Good morning. 

Indeed the point is now very clear sir thank you.
09/09/23, 9:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely afternoon. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. How are you doing today?
09/09/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 247 6942: Good morning Mr Shivjeet, am doing ok thank you hope you are well too
09/09/23, 10:02 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
09/09/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir we may proceed
09/09/23, 10:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/09/23, 10:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/09/23, 10:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir i am aligned its pretty clear
09/09/23, 10:32 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/09/23, 10:32 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/09/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir the sxplanation is clear
09/09/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/09/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/09/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 11, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 11, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 11, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/09/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 247 6942: Am clear sir i am following, we may proceed
09/09/23, 10:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/09/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 247 6942: Kindly share more information sir as i am not aware how the scholarship is assessed in the absense of the A level results
09/09/23, 11:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
09/09/23, 11:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
09/09/23, 11:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
09/09/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 247 6942: Well explained sir thank you, i am clear now
09/09/23, 11:13 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
09/09/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 247 6942: Yes confirmed sir i am aware
09/09/23, 11:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/09/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 247 6942: Confirmed sir, that is true
09/09/23, 11:26 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 11:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/09/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 247 6942: I am clear with option 1 sir, we may proceed
09/09/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/09/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/09/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir, i am clear we may proceed
09/09/23, 11:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/09/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 247 6942: Well explained sir, we may proceed
09/09/23, 11:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
09/09/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 247 6942: I have gone through all the 7 sir and i am clear on all of them. I do not have any questions. So we may proceed
09/09/23, 11:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. Hence, I shall conclude our session for today and let us connect on Monday. Have a great weekend.
09/09/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Thank you sir have a great weeknd too
11/09/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Vimbai. How are you doing this lovely evening?
11/09/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 247 6942: We are doing ok sir thank you. Hope you are doing well too
11/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am great too, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
11/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir we can proceed
11/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Vimbai , I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decsion, as we touched upon the previous day..
11/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure, family discussion was done and as a family we managed to agree to take up the opportunity of early decision on the admission.
11/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
11/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir, i am the parent, Vimbai is currently at school. Thank you for asking we do not have any questions we all clear, we may proceed sir.
11/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the reminder. May I know if I am currently talking to Mrs. Raina?

 Please let me know if I am wrong here.
11/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 247 6942: You are correct sir.
11/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
11/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Confirmed sir, i am aware after going through our previous session and confirm that we are ready to start the process
11/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
11/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
11/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir we are on the same page. We may proceed.
11/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
11/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
11/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
11/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir i am very much clear on that one.
12/09/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Vimbai.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time I was about to reach out. 


Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet, we may proceed with the session
12/09/23, 2:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
12/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure we may proceed sir.
12/09/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 05th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 20th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
12/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir i am clear we may proceed
12/09/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
12/09/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
12/09/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, the deadline becomes the 1st of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 1st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 1st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well? <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Is the second deadline correct sir?
12/09/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have corrected the same. Kindly go through the message and let me know if you have any concerns regarding the same.
12/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 247 6942: No sir all is clear now
12/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
12/09/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Good evening sir, i had taken time to understand the two options sir and they are clear. I do not have any questions we may proceed
12/09/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
12/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Ok sir

The first option is the standard registration whereby the registration fee ranges between $500 to $750 and once the student receives the offer letter they will be given 15days to make the full registration fee.

The second option is the early registration whereby the registration fee will be $750 but Edoofa will give a grant of $150 to the student and they will have to pay $600. The $600 can be paid in 2 installments whereby the first 50% is paid within 15days from date of offer letter then the balance will be paid in 30days from the deadline date of the first 50%. <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days.
12/09/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
12/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Confirmed sir all is clear.
12/09/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
12/09/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.
12/09/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *1st October* and *1st November*.
12/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *1st October* and *1st November*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare NAME’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
12/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well noted sir and all is clear. 

Kindly go ahead and submit Vimbai's application to the relevant universities as we are ready for the early decision registration for her. Thank you.
12/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Name’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *1st October* and *1st November* ) and are mentally prepared for the next steps? <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure confirmed sir, you may proceed we are ready.
12/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Vimbai's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Vimbai’s higher education well.
12/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well noted and appreciated Mr Shivjeet. Thank you so much.
12/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome parents and Vimbai. 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well noted sir and good night.
20/09/23, 9:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Vimbai!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
20/09/23, 9:48 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
20/09/23, 9:48 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 247 6942: Good morning Mr Milan Singh, the letter is well received thank you. We will go through it and come back to you.
20/09/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 247 6942: Confirm one more thing Mr Singh, is this the only offer she managed to get or there might be more offers coming.
20/09/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 247 6942: Good morning Mr Shivjeet, i do have some questions that i need clarification on the offer letter, what time might be convenient for you to have a short discussion.
20/09/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263772476942 I have gone through the queries that you have posted here regarding the offer letter, and stay assured that I will help you in understanding about the same during our discussion moving ahead. For now, may you please let me know if you have gone through the offer letter by now?
20/09/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Confirmed sir i have gone through the offer letter
20/09/23, 1:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Ok noted my responses are as below

1. Semester tuition fee after scholarship is $900
2. Standard duration period for the course is 4years
3. Admission and procedure fee is $300
4. Registration fee is $750
20/09/23, 1:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 247 6942: All clear sir
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 247 6942: All clear on accommodation types sir
20/09/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 247 6942: All clear sir.
20/09/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 247 6942: All clear on the examination fees sir
20/09/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
20/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 247 6942: All clear sir we may proceed
20/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
20/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir we are aligned
20/09/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/09/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/09/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure i am still residing in Harare
20/09/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/09/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/09/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well noted thank you sir
20/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir you may go ahead and share the account details
20/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well received thank you sir.
20/09/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well noted and much appreciated sir, will work on processing the payment and advise once done.\
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 247 6942: It is all clear sir.
20/09/23, 2:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Well understood sir
20/09/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 247 6942: I do not have any questions sir we may proceed
20/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

22/09/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Vimbai!

How are you doing today? Were you able to have a conversation as a family regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
22/09/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Good afternoon Mr Singh, sure we did have the conversation as a family and agreed to take up the offer.
22/09/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's great to know that you spoke with your family about your career and I'm confident they were happy to see you making progress in the right direction. How did the conversation with your family go? What were their thoughts?
22/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Good evening Mr Singh, my sincere apologies to notify that Vimbai is currently at school and do not have access  to her mobile. This is her mother and we do agree to take up the offer on her behalf. One more thing we have not received the offer later via the email from the university as you alluded earlier. Should we go ahead and take the one you sent on this platform as the formal communication from the university.
24/09/23, 7:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Vimbai!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/09/23, 7:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please @263772476942 I understand that Vimbai is at school and could not find time to go through the offer letter, now, since we have already discussed the offer letter, you can surely move ahead to consider this as a formal communication from the side of the university and focus on securing the seat for Vimbai. 

I hope this is understood?
24/09/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 247 6942: It is well understood sir. Thank you, we will go on and secure her seat.
24/09/23, 8:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, I find it reassuring that you as parents have been working hard to ensure that your child's career is on the right path and that you're well-prepared to support Vimbai. Following your discussion with your family about the offer letter, do you have any questions or concerns that you would like us to address?
24/09/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir, we are in full support of Vimbai's career. We have understood everything in the offer letter and do not have any questions sir. Thank you for asking.
24/09/23, 8:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you have any questions or require any help, feel free to bring them up and share them with us here. We can discuss them and assist you in planning for your child's education.
24/09/23, 8:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I hope that you have discussed with your family the registration fee, payment deadlines, and mode of payment and that you have also taken note of these important details since they are crucial in reserving your scholarship seat right?
24/09/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Sure sir, we are fully aware of the important details.
24/09/23, 8:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. May I know if you are planning to make the payment of your fee in one part of $600 to complete the process early or in two parts of $300 as per the due dates shared by the university so that we can pass the same information to them?
24/09/23, 10:55 pm - +263 77 247 6942: We are going to make the payment in two parts as per the due dates shared by the university sir.

It seems that you are taking the appropriate steps toward financing your education and should reserve your scholarship seat soon. Additionally, could you please inform me of the date when you intend to pay your fees?

23/11/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Vimbai,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?
23/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 247 6942: Good evening Ms Ashi. This is well noted and clear. Thank you so much for the update.

13/12/23, 8:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Vimbai,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications). <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 8:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
13/12/23, 8:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
13/12/23, 8:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
