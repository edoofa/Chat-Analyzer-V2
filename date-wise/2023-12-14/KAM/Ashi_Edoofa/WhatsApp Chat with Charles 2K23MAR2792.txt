It has been a while since our last interaction, and I believe you are eagerly anticipating the same.

We will be sharing detailed information about required documents, deadlines, and any additional guidance that might be beneficial.

01/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 385 1617: I am prepared
01/09/23, 12:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like to inquire whether you have been able to gather the following documents for your upcoming admission process:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
01/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 385 1617: Let me look for them
01/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 385 1617: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 1:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you, please carry on.
01/09/23, 6:22 pm - +263 71 385 1617: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 6:22 pm - +263 71 385 1617: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 385 1617: So for the late reply something went wrong on my phone
01/09/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 385 1617: I have sent all the required documents
01/09/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me. As we are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year of 2024. So, before we commence with your admission process, I'd like to inquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission process.
01/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 71 385 1617: Yes I do remember
01/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
01/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 385 1617: I understood and I am aware
01/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Charles, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
01/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
01/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 71 385 1617: Understood
01/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 71 385 1617: It is  I am aware
01/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
01/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 385 1617: Yes I am
01/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
01/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 385 1617: No I wasn't aware of that
01/09/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
01/09/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period. <This message was edited>
01/09/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:
01/09/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
01/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 71 385 1617: Understood
01/09/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 385 1617: And it's pretty much exciting
02/09/23, 7:11 am - +263 71 385 1617: Morning
02/09/23, 10:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Charles. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session as we have relaxed our hours because of the weekend.
02/09/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 385 1617: Yes we are available for today
02/09/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 223 3391: Good morning. Yes we are available
04/09/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Charles.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further on Saturday, as an unexpected meeting came up with the team and my presence was required. 

For the missed session that was planned, I would like to schedule our session this evening at 8:30 PM CAT. Please let me know if this timing works for you?
04/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 223 3391: As parents yes we will be available but as for Charles he has since left for school and he will not be available
04/09/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We shall connect at the said hours for the continuation of our session.
04/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted and agreed 💯
04/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. May I know if you are ready to continue with your session for the admission process?
04/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Good evening. Yes we are ready
04/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
04/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
04/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Well explained and clear. Let's proceed
04/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 223 3391: We are online
04/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
04/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
04/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 223 3391: We are experiencing poor network but we are still available
04/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Resonates well yes,but how do I  or helps me keep the fees constant
04/09/23, 10:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern. If you decide to go though your registration process you will be able to lock your fee structure for the year 2023 and it will be constant through out your career. I hope we are on the same page here?
04/09/23, 10:43 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes now on same page let's proceed
05/09/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Charles.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
05/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 223 3391: We are available. Let's proceed
05/09/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/09/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted let's proceed
05/09/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/09/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/09/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2024. Have you followed the details so far, Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Nothing all is clear so far. Let's proceed
05/09/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/09/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 223 3391: 1. Working on probabilities. The child will pass at least 2 A level passes.

2. Using an early bird catches the fattest worm principle. Will get a discounted figure of 150 USD  of college fees through Edoofa.

,3.to pay the balance either once off or in 2 parts, but within a month
05/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
05/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
05/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
05/09/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Understood let's proceed.
05/09/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 223 3391: This message was deleted
05/09/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 223 3391: This message was deleted
05/09/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a student fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
06/09/23, 12:58 am - +263 77 223 3391: Yes. Agreed 💯
06/09/23, 1:03 am - +263 77 223 3391: Sorry for late reply. I was having very very slow network.
06/09/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Charles.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 

For further continuation please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
06/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Available and let's proceed
06/09/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
06/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Copied let's proceed
06/09/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
06/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Agreed let's proceed
06/09/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe Charles  will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once her results come in 2024, she will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue her bachelor's degree then.
06/09/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his exams, and his scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 223 3391: It's clear. Only a point of correction that (he) Charles is a first time A-level seater this November 2023 and results should be ready next year 2024 by March very latest.
06/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Let's proceed
06/09/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed that is correct .
06/09/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
06/09/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on Charles's A Level results, he won't be able to continue with his bachelor's degree in 2023, and if instead of reappearing for his exams and starting with his Bachelor's in 2024, if he wishes not to take a step back, he will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of his interest in August 2023 itself.
06/09/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted let's proceed
06/09/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/09/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Very clear let's proceed
06/09/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/09/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Copied. Let's move on
06/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
06/09/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes they are all clear. Let's proceed.
06/09/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. So I would like to schedule our session for tomorrow at 7:30 PM for further continuation of our session. Have a great day ahead.
06/09/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Same to you thanks.
06/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 223 3391: But just a re-cape like I've said that Charles is back at school since 03/09/23. No access to phone according to school regulations. So you have been speaking to his parents and we are in agreement with the discussions so far and him too is okay with them.
 Thank you.
07/09/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Mr. Albert,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session

07/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful Mr. Albert. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if you have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
08/09/23, 2:07 am - +263 77 223 3391: No further questions as yet
08/09/23, 6:02 am - +263 77 223 3391: Let's proceed
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
08/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Good evening Ms Shivjeet
08/09/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings! I hope you're enjoying this beautiful evening. Kindly excuse me for the late reply. May I know if you are available to proceed with the session?
08/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Apology accepted. Good evening. Ready let's proceed
09/09/23, 9:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely Morning. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. How are you doing today?
09/09/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 223 3391: Good morning. Am doing fine and yourself?
09/09/23, 11:48 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking Mr. Albert. May I know if you are comfortable to proceed with the session?
09/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 223 3391: Yes let's proceed
09/09/23, 11:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Mr. Albert, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decisions, as we touched upon the previous day.
09/09/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 223 3391: Yes I did
09/09/23, 11:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Mr. Albert. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
09/09/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted and agreed let's proceed
09/09/23, 12:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know.  After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
09/09/23, 12:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
09/09/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Same page. Let's proceed
09/09/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Hoping to get one with very minimal charges
09/09/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Just to be exact on the dot.

It's 2000 to 3000 per year

A  year has 2 semesters 
  Wich reduces to 1000  to 1500 per semester.

Is this our correct standing
11/09/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Charles.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out as it was the weekend. 

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
11/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Good. Evening and how are you ma'am. We are all fine hear. Let's proceed
11/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. The detailed numbers will be mentioned in the offer letter shared by the universities
11/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If we are clear shall we proceed with the session?
11/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Very clear. Let's proceed
11/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
11/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
11/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
11/09/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Clear. Let's proceed
12/09/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mr. Albert and Charles.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 


Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes am bit busy but will be able to participate
12/09/23, 2:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great, as you are aware that your registration fee will be between $500 to $750, to be on the safer side, let us assume your registration fee is $750. Once you get your offer letter, you would be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your registration fee of $750.
12/09/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For example, if you get your offer letter on 15th September 2023 and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, which makes the deadline for your fee of $750 30th September 2023 and hence you would have to make the payment of your fee before then. Are you clear on this?
	
*Note: The above-mentioned dates are an example and we will discuss the actual dates further*
12/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted. Let's proceed
12/09/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 223 3391: This message was deleted
12/09/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 223 3391: I want to believe this message is just a standard noem and would not apply in my case since we are already past 30 August but I've taken noted of 15 days grace period.
12/09/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, it is correct. I am now sharing you with a new realistic message with realistic dates.
12/09/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, since all the students have received their results and are eager to complete their university admission process, If you as parents are prepared to proceed with your child’s admission process, we would share your application with the universities this week so that you can get the scholarship offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, the registration fee due will be $750 and you would have to pay it as per the deadline of 30th September.
12/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Well well. Noted let's proceed
12/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
12/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes sure ma'am. Let's proceed
12/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 1st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
12/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes it's clear. Though I've always pinned my hopes on the lower (500)  fees side
12/09/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed we can try to work on that as well.
12/09/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
12/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
12/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, the deadline becomes the 1st of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 1st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 1st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
12/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Same page let's proceed
12/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
13/09/23, 6:43 am - +263 77 223 3391: Good morning. Sorry for late reply as I had bad network.
13/09/23, 6:46 am - +263 77 223 3391: I've gone through and am following up. Procedures are all clear,but allow me to raise questions in the midst as it  comes. Even of previous sessions.
13/09/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Mr. Albert and Charles. How are you doing this lovely evening?
13/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 223 3391: We are very well thank you
13/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Shall we proceed with the session.
13/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes let's proceed
13/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
13/09/23, 10:21 pm - +263 77 223 3391: 1.*Early Registration/University Admission process -*

A student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.


 Early Decision Grant of $150 paid by Edoofa.

Balance to be paid student and family  within the first 15 days and balance within a month from deadline for the first part of the fee
13/09/23, 10:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it was a long day for me, and my available hours are coming to an end, I would like to conclude our session for now. Let us connect tomorrow to continue our session further. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
13/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Standard Registration/University Admission process

 registration fee for example will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university.

Once one gets the offer letter from the university,  one gets a period of 15 days to make the payment of one's complete registration fee of $750.

Then fees are to be paid within the next 15 days.
13/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted same to you thank you
14/09/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Charles. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Good evening Admissions officer. How has your day been
14/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Hopefully fine
14/09/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Mr. Abert. Shall we further proceed with the session where we last left off?
14/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes. With pleasure ma'am
14/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Hi ope we will be able to cover quite some ground today before we start experiencing poor network
14/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know in advance.  Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
14/09/23, 10:53 pm - +263 77 223 3391: It's clear and as parents we are in agreement and prepared for the admission process you can share the applications.

We want o follow the early registration process
14/09/23, 10:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please I am happy to hear that, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
14/09/23, 10:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.
14/09/23, 10:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *3rd October* and *3rd November*.
14/09/23, 10:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *3rd October* and *3rd November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Charles’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
14/09/23, 10:59 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Go-ahead and make Charles's application for the scholarship
14/09/23, 11:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Name’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *3rd October* and *3rd November*.) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
14/09/23, 11:01 pm - +263 77 223 3391: And share it with the universities that are applica be le with the course most importantly cheap and affordable- Lower fees
14/09/23, 11:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we shall do that.
14/09/23, 11:02 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted and agreed
14/09/23, 11:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Charles’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Charles’s higher education well.
14/09/23, 11:03 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Thank you let's proceed
14/09/23, 11:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome parents and Name. 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
20/09/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 223 3391: I've received and read the letter
20/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Okay. I wanted or am going over the letter and jotting down my areas of clarity needs then take a pic and send you to respond. Is that okay with you
20/09/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, you can do that and we will then discuss about those queries towards the end of our discussion here. For now, please go through the letter and let me know of the above points.
20/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 223 3391: 1. 900
2. 3years
3. 300 USD
4.
20/09/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263772233391 Please answer question number 4 as well dear.
20/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Am missing that part only to see where it's written semester registration of 100 USD
20/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, you have to write about your registration fee that is mentioned in your offer letter please.
20/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Ooooh I've picked it up number.
Registration fee is 750 USD
20/09/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted let's proceed
20/09/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Ok. Noted. So now what do you mean.

1. Is the accomodation fees over and above the 1800 or it's part of the 1800???
20/09/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: The accommodation fees mentioned for on-campus and off-campus options are separate from the tuition fees. Your annual tuition fee after the scholarship is $1800. On-campus accommodation costs range from $2000 to $2500 per annum, while off-campus options can be around $1200 with university-approved accommodations or approximately $800 if you find your own place. These accommodation expenses are in addition to the tuition fees, so you'll need to budget for both when planning your finances for studying at Galgotias University. I hope it is clear now?
20/09/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yeah it's clear though all along I was meant to believe that  the proposed figures included everything. I remember long back when we started the applications it was mentioned something like that 

Now it means as parent am supposed to budget  about 3800 of tuition and boarding / annum.

Yeah true a sudden jump and chocking  of figures of figures
20/09/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, I understand that. On that note, if I am correct, your counselor had informed you that the fee would be around $2000-3000 per annum including everything, right?
20/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Very true and correct now this is almost 4000+    to include semester and all ancillary costs
20/09/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please I understand that. For that, I would advise you to just wait till the end of this discussion and you will understand how will the costs be dealt with. Now, shall we move ahead from here?
20/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes let's proceed
20/09/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes let's proceed
20/09/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes am following shall we proceed
21/09/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Charles!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting that came up. Now, I appreciate your patience here and let us move ahead with our discussion here.
21/09/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well? <This message was edited>
21/09/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 223 3391: Clear let's move on. Good morning
21/09/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
21/09/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 223 3391: Noted let's proceed. But confirm the 300 has been waived for the whole duration of the course content???
21/09/23, 11:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right! Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
21/09/23, 11:18 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
21/09/23, 11:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
21/09/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 223 3391: Noted I also want to understand that the 150 has been removed for the entire course as well ????
21/09/23, 11:37 am - Milan Edoofa: @263772233391 Here, the $150 Grant that you had received is for the registration fee that you would pay. This means that it is only applicable on the registration fee only. I hope this is clear, right?
21/09/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 223 3391: Clear let's proceed
21/09/23, 11:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/09/23, 11:43 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/09/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 223 3391: Yes am in Harare
21/09/23, 11:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/09/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/09/23, 11:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/09/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 223 3391: Noted let's proceed
21/09/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
21/09/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 223 3391: Yes you may share just to be safe but my archives must have
21/09/23, 11:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/09/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 223 3391: Noted let's proceed
21/09/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
21/09/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 223 3391: Yeah but the truth is we do not know anyone in India neither are we family with the living standard
21/09/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 223 3391: Starndards
21/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 223 3391: And off cumpus fee obvious doesn't include food right
21/09/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand your concerns about moving to a new country, especially when you may not have any contacts or familiarity with the living standards there. It's a common apprehension when considering studying abroad. However, I'd like to assure you that for all the universities that are partnered with us, you can expect high living standards as well as top-quality education to be maintained. I hope this is understood?
21/09/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. On the $800 accommodation costs that are mentioned here, the food costs are also factored in. Hence, you can stay assured of that as well. I hope this is clear?
21/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Clear there. There other issues apart from food like access to wifi, daily transport costs, security of my child etc. How are they taken care with this out of cumpos accomodation
21/09/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is indeed a very good question. On that note, I would like to mention that, for us here at Edoofa, the safety of our students is always a top priority and that is why we ensure that the universities that we partner with have all the measures in place to ensure the safety of our students even at the off-campus accommodations. I want to assure you that off-campus accommodations are safe and secure. They are usually located within gated communities and have 24-hour CCTV surveillance.

Along with that, we here at Edoofa take the welfare of all the students who arrive here in India so seriously that we also have a dedicated Department of Student Welfare that is set up specially to take care of all the students who will arrive here in India and make sure that their academic journey after coming here is a smooth one with them having the best university experience. I hope this is clear now?
21/09/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moreover, Wifi facility is available at all places including accommodation, university campus, etc. And when it comes to Transport costs, there won't be any transport costs since all the off-campus accommodation options are located at a walking distance from the university campus please. I hope this is clear?
21/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Also going  forward will there be options of paying these monies in phases
21/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 223 3391: And studying facilities are good??
21/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 223 3391: In that case whoo then provide them with food and how
21/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Will I have options change accomodation status in the midst. Like I start with on- campus later change to off-campus or vise versa.  Depending on availability of cash
21/09/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please moving ahead, for the balance payments as well, there would be the option to pay it in different parts.
21/09/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Indeed, for all the partner universities of Edoofa, they offer top quality education and study facilities so that students can excel in the same. I hope this is clear?
21/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 223 3391: About universities it's clear. Am referring to off-campus accomodation. Like will there be facilities suitable for studying/ reading etc.cooking facilities, and the actual cooking how they do it
21/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Like I mentioned earlier I've never been in India to test leaving
21/09/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Of course, I understand your concerns about living in a new country for your studies. When it comes to off-campus accommodations in India, you can expect a safe and conducive environment for your academic pursuits. These accommodations are equipped with study areas in the rooms where students can focus on your studies comfortably. 

Additionally, you'll have access to kitchen facilities or shared kitchenettes, allowing you to prepare your meals according to your preferences. However, if you prefer not to cook, you can explore various nearby dining options, as Indian cuisine offers a wide variety of choices. I hope this is clear?
21/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Very clear
21/09/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/09/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Very clear. Let's proceed
21/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 223 3391: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 223 3391: May you please kindly furnish on this part
22/09/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Good morning I was made to believe that the 200 was included and removed from my expenses here.
22/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Also to get  clarity here.

When am paying my expenses for the first semester I have to subtract the 150  grant from these figures right????
22/09/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 223 3391: I mean for my initial semester of 2024 pymnts??
22/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Charles!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
22/09/23, 1:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding this, can you please first help me in understanding more about which $200 are you talking about here dear?
22/09/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Charles, the $150 Grant that is being offered to you here is adjusted in your registration fee please, this means that you will pay $150 less than your registration fee and the whole amount will be adjusted in your first year fee. I hope this is clear?
22/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Good afternoon
22/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted let's proceed
22/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 223 3391: The 200 for semester registrations
22/09/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Charles, may you please be a bit clear about this $200 dear, so that I can help you in understanding the same?
22/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 223 3391: May we please skip this at the moment for progress I'll revert to later. It may be answered as we go
22/09/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear. Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
22/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted
22/09/23, 2:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
22/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted. Only small question that I was meant to understand that  there shall 2 or 3 universities to chose from. Just an ask. Maybe I may have  a cheaper one on boarding and opt for on campus
22/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 223 3391: We may proceed
22/09/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are following?
22/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes following and agreed. Let's proceed
22/09/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
22/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Clear let's proceed
22/09/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
22/09/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes am aware let's proceed
22/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Let's leave this issue for now as we may loose out on the fatty early bird fatty worm.
22/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Quas bonum tinate
22/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Let's grab this opportunity and move on
23/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Questions.

1. How long are After semester breaks and where will these students be?

On my offer letter they mantioned that they need A-level results before registration and a registration fee deposit is required with 15 days.

Now the young man is to seat for his A- level in November 2023. How is this balanced.

3. Is bedding linen provided in both scenerios. On and off campus.
24/09/23, 7:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Charles!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/09/23, 7:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
24/09/23, 7:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, however, in order to make sure that you have clarity about the same, Let me first help you in getting a proper understanding about the Transfer Option here. Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
24/09/23, 7:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
24/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Understood.
24/09/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Sorry am just getting the messages now it was due to poor network
24/09/23, 9:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding this, let me answer it here as well:

1. The semester breaks are around a month long and the students stay at their respective accommodations during that time, however, is  a student wants to go back home, they can do that as well.

2. Yes, please. That statement means that before coming to India and completing the registration at the university campus, students would have to submit their A-Level Results. Hence, you do not have to worry about that.

3. Bedding is indeed provided at the accommodations please.
24/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted and the payments done would include their stay at accomodations during holidays. No top ups
24/09/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right!
24/09/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear about the queries that you had?
24/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Maybe just more clarity on off campus food availability.

U said food is catered for in the 800 USD right?

So Who buys the food for them or it's supplied to their rooms.
24/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 223 3391: May you kin kindly help on this question. Thank you.
26/09/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Charles!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/09/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query here please. Regarding that, I would like to mention that the food costs that are factored in the off-campus accommodation costs of $800 include the self-cooking costs, i.e. when all the students combine their food requirements and then cook for themselves together. I hope this is clear?
26/09/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 223 3391: Clear. Let's proceed
26/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Okay.like I said:

Am taking up the Gogatias offer.

I shall make plans to pay the 300 deposit before 4/10/23.

Initially am taking up the off-campus accomodation option, because of cash issues.

This option I will quickly change to on-campus soon I get the balance of 1200.

I would have loved him to start with the on-campus option while he is getting used to the diets, lifestyles etc. So am tirelessly working towards that. Thank you.
26/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see your dedication towards making your child's life easier and to make sure that he does not face any difficulties please.
26/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask? <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 223 3391: So far so good if anything comes along will raise it. Let's move ahead. Good afternoon
26/09/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
26/09/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

01/11/23, 10:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right, and it would be like that if you would choose the on-campus accommodation. For the off-campus accommodation it would be lesser than that, I hope this is clear?
01/11/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Yes its clear. Since its first country and fist time I've no better opt except to force opt for the on-campus, though on the high side.
01/11/23, 10:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I understand your concern here, however, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please. 

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right? <This message was edited>

Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.

Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
