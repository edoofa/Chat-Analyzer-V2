21/08/23, 8:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.

23/08/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay, got an urgent call.
23/08/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: So before I begin this journey, can I know more about you and what are your aspirations for Hasting's EWYL Journey?
23/08/23, 8:52 am - +260 96 6650712: I aspire to see him achieve all his dreams and goals, of course, through the Edoofa programme. 
I am going to be glad to see him become a successful man
23/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear that ma'am from you and I hope that with all our support, he will be able to achieve even greater milestones.
23/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: So Hasting, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
23/08/23, 9:13 am - +260 761470673: Owning a big farm land is one of my long term goals and the EWYL program will help me to pay off some of the school fees thus reducing the cost of my higher education. This will help my guardian to continue with her dreams as well since the expenses will be reduced.
23/08/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Wow, you wish to own a farm land, I have never heard any student with such dream

You want to do farming?
23/08/23, 9:24 am - +260 761470673: Yes, i would like do farming as i am working on my dream career.
23/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is so good Hasting, many students don't aspire to do that but seeing some students grounded in the work that can help their economy is so good⚡
23/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/08/23, 9:30 am - +260 761470673: Not really, elaborate more on those objectives.
23/08/23, 1:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.
I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.
24/08/23, 8:31 am - +260 761470673: Good morning.
24/08/23, 8:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

24/08/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
24/08/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
24/08/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
24/08/23, 8:45 am - +260 761470673: Now it's clear.
24/08/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
24/08/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 8:54 am - +260 761470673: This is great.
24/08/23, 9:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what you grasped from the mail?
24/08/23, 9:20 am - +260 761470673: How greatfull he is, having an opportunity to fulfill his career through the Edoofa program under EWYL program.
24/08/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad that you have these views, I promise to work as hard as you and help you achieve even higher milestone.
24/08/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.
24/08/23, 11:32 am - +260 761470673: So what actually is it evolved  in order to earn these credits?
24/08/23, 11:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will discuss that very soon!

29/08/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…

29/08/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/08/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what all you grasped about me from the video?
29/08/23, 9:05 am - +260 761470673: You are very passionate on helping students to achieve their goals.
29/08/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much Hasting, means a lot to me!
 I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
29/08/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/08/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 9:36 am - +260 761470673: I have read and it is truly inspiring.

I'll see you on *Thursday* from 08:30-09:30 AM since the organization will remain closed on the occasion of our Indian festival _Raksha Bandhan_�

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
29/08/23, 10:48 am - +260 761470673: Thank you and have a great celebration.
29/08/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you Hasting!

31/08/23, 9:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Coming to this, may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
31/08/23, 9:13 am - +260 761470673: Mainly the whole newsletter was full of important points but I would say 'quote section.'
31/08/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, even I like the quotes section a lot, they are so refreshing always⚡
31/08/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Hasting?
31/08/23, 9:23 am - +260 761470673: It sounds so great.
31/08/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
31/08/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
31/08/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.

So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!

21/09/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey.

21/09/23, 10:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
21/09/23, 12:08 pm - +260 761470673: 1. Monday and Thursday

21/09/23, 12:24 pm - +260 761470673: Ok, thanks 😊.
07/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings my lovely student,

Happy Saturday! We hope you're all feeling fantastic today. As part of our Saturday activity, we have something special in store for you that's all about celebrating our Edoofian pride!

Today's activity is all about showcasing your pride as an Edoofian.

This is your opportunity to share your Edoofian spirit and what makes you proud to be part of our community.

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

13/12/23, 12:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofians, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
