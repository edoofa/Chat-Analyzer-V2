I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*

How are you?
20/10/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the past, I have tried to schedule multiple calls with you and there has been no response from your end towards the call. I am sure there must be a valid reason with you for missing more than 5 calls that I have been scheduling so far. Prince in a similar way, I also understand the pressure that you must be receiving from these exams in the initial stage, I have gone through it and I can completely empathize with it. But I just want to at least discuss things and make it easier for both of us in the future. Today, I made sure that as soon as I start my work, I share what I feel about the situation. Please share with me if there is anything. I am genuinely saying it you that I always consider every student my younger brother/sister and like an internal family. Trust me, I will help you out if there is anything even beyond Edoofa.
20/10/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: I would appreciate it if we have this call to discuss the same.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
