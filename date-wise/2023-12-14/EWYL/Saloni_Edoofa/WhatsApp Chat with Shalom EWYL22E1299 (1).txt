09/08/23, 7:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: - Please make sure you share the videos with me on the *EWYL Line* before your session commences
- Please follow the daily ritual on the EWYL Line of saying ' *I am a proud edoofian*'

I won't be available today since I will be occupied in some family event but please make sure you update everything to me as required.
10/08/23, 9:24 am - +27 71 338 1161: Morning. Please tell us if Shalom is going to get the Acceptance letter or not. We are tired of explaining one thing. You guys accepted the grade 12 results knowing fully that she is waiting for a certificate and you asked for money from us which we paid fully but now we can't get the letter.

We need a refund if you can't get us the Acceptance letter from GGI
11/08/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Friday my proud Edoofian!

Hope you are well.

Through this lesson, I learned that Video blogging, or vlogging, has transformed how we share stories and insights. With just a camera and a creative mind, individuals can transport audiences into their world, adding a visual and personal touch to their narratives. Vlogging blends entertainment, education, and authenticity, allowing creators to connect with viewers on a deeper level. From travel escapades to cooking tutorials, vlogging's dynamic nature captures attention, fostering a sense of community and fostering a global conversation through the power of visual storytelling.

In this session, I want to learn what all you grasped about *VIDEO BLOGGING* and yes, *PROJECT UPDATES*
29/08/23, 10:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Shalom!

14/09/23, 3:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Shalom, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to GGI in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you.

09/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 4:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
