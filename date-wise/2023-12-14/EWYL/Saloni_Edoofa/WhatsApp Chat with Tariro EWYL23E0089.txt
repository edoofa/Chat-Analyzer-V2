I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in plans. Instead of having our session tomorrow, I will be conducting it today from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm. The reason for this change is that I'll be on leave tomorrow as my mother has come to town, and I'd like to spend some time with her.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

Enjoy your day!
12/08/23, 10:58 am - +91 78273 08969: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.

16/10/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Also, as your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 21/10/2023

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

16/10/23, 4:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 2) You have to make a 3-4 minutes video and the video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
16/10/23, 4:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? I have learnt that education gives us the keys to have a better future and hope to thrive our careers 

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
Although I always loved health sciences , growing up poor from a poor family and area made it difficult to have access to the fine tools to access help and support. Thus i was a pereon with no money but had a vision . So , I borrowed medicine books from the library and did virtual tours of the nursing schools and the MOMA from my home computer. I have been learning all by myself and if given a chance I could excel and hopefully become a doctor .

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? Edoofa education intends to make tertiary education education affordable and available to all considering how most universities have worrisomely become expensive in Africa.Also through Edoofa, students can pay for their own fees by attaining scholarship credits and this can help them to lesson the financial burden on their parents.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? Because I am passionate about learning.l want further my education and in the process be in a position to be accommodative as well as embracing different cultures and people.

20/10/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here's the breakdown of this incredible $300 opportunity:
 You'll receive $75 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of $200.
 An additional $25 will be yours if the referred student pays the remaining $150 as partial enrollment fees.
1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you please ask your parents to share their views on the same Tariro?

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

15/11/23, 4:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

27/11/23, 8:49 am - +91 89685 78121: According to me, spirit of competition means unlocking your full potential, tackling challenges and sailing through them. It is about being resilient and not backing down because you know your whole life depends on it. One such encounter for me was when I was doing my visa application process whilst I was still in Zimbabwe. It was tiresome, sometimes gave me stress but I knew l had to keep on going because I was determined to be at school. I am always in a competition with myself and I had to prove it myself. I was also racing against time, l knew l was lagging behind so it gave me a reason not to backdown
27/11/23, 8:49 am - +91 89685 78121: Noted
27/11/23, 10:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: I appreciate your perspective on the spirit of competition. Your determination and resilience during the visa application process showcase a commendable attitude. Facing challenges with a mindset of continuous improvement and racing against time reflects a strong commitment to your goals. Keep pushing forward, and your competitive spirit will undoubtedly lead to more achievements. Best of luck in all your endeavors! 👏🌟
27/11/23, 2:29 pm - +91 89685 78121: Hello mam
27/11/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 89685 78121: Yes please
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 

Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 89685 78121: I remember it stated that I would be getting $250 annually
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Tariro, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - +91 89685 78121: Yes l do
Participating  in the webinars, doing projects that is community building
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - +91 89685 78121: Plus I only get to redeem them next semester
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share the elaborate understanding.
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 89685 78121: Noted
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 89685 78121: Am following mam
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 3:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 89685 78121: It's not that bad I think
27/11/23, 3:10 pm - +91 89685 78121: I missed some of the webinars due to 5 to 6pm make up classes that I couldn't miss considering l came to school a little bit late. I have a lot of catching up to do
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that!
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:20 pm - +91 89685 78121: Okay mam
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - +91 89685 78121: So it means my $750 grant money that I had earned whilst in Zimbabwe, l won't be able to earn them?
27/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You won't be able to redeem them now since your performance well short of what guidelines we set to avail the grant and this is as of September and October.
27/11/23, 3:24 pm - +91 89685 78121: I have a query mam
27/11/23, 3:26 pm - +91 89685 78121: September and October were the months l was running around with visa application process and it was a lot of work. Do you also consider that juggling the two is a bit impossible. It is hard mam. Well let me speak for myself it was hard for me
27/11/23, 3:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Tariro, tell me one thing.
27/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 89685 78121: Anyway, I will try again 😊. I can't promise a 100% effort, exams are fast approaching. I have a lot of reading to do, meaning to say l have to somehow balance the two. Otherwise the whole reason for engaging into these projects that can help me to earn money for my tuition will be lost if "God forbid", l fail
27/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 89685 78121: Okay
27/11/23, 3:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Did you attend any sessions with me in November?
Did you share any updates on the $300 plan with me in November that you did some days in October?
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, Tariro, you have got the idea of it and this analysis is as of October only. You will be evaluated for the month of November and December and final results will be out.
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will continue our discussion tomorrow from 06:00 - 07:00 PM, please make sure you come on time for the session.
27/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 89685 78121: I attended some of the sessions. And to answer your other question. I don't know if giving you some offline application forms of interested students count

09/12/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 2:45 pm - +91 89685 78121: How many people have redeemed their grants so far?
09/12/23, 2:45 pm - +91 89685 78121: Are they just promises?
09/12/23, 3:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's begin with our session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
I am super excited🚀
09/12/23, 7:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
12/12/23, 8:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tariro,
How are you?

Well, so far, as of November end, a lot of students have stood eligible for the grat and most of them have even earned more than the grant amount.
13/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Happy Wednesday!*

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni Rastogi
