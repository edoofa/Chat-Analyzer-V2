17/10/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
17/10/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 267 4398: Let me revert once i talk to Tanatswa. She is at xool, preparing for her A level final exams tomorrow
17/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 267 4398: Hi @Saloni, i am failing to get hold of Tanatswa by phone. Could be network issues, my apologies. Is it possible to postpone this discussion?
17/10/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Tanatswanashe takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Tanatswanashe is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
17/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 267 4398: I understand. Will ask her to contact you the soonest, for the smooth flow of your plan
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: These are basic formalities that even you can do. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

06/12/23, 11:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: MoU stands for "Memorandum of Understanding." It is a formal agreement between two or more parties outlining their intention to work together on a particular project or towards a common goal. While an MoU is a formal document, it is typically less binding than a formal contract. It often serves as a preliminary step in the negotiation process and provides a framework for collaboration.
06/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 832 4244: Thank you for your time

07/12/23, 10:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
07/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 832 4244: Noted ma'am
07/12/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/12/23, 10:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Tanatswanashe/Saloni/7DEC2023*
07/12/23, 10:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/12/23, 10:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
07/12/23, 10:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
07/12/23, 10:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
07/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 832 4244: Noted ma'am
07/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you have understood from it?
07/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 832 4244: I have to create a WhatsApp group to be able to reach out to a large pool of students so that I  can tell them about EDOOFA and share information   with them . The students should be currently in form 5 or 6 or should have passed their form 5 .
07/12/23, 12:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 10:00-11:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
07/12/23, 12:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will discuss this tomorrow for sure.
08/12/23, 10:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tanatswanashe,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
08/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 832 4244: I'm fine thank you for asking. Yes we can begin
08/12/23, 10:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, you have shared it well!
08/12/23, 10:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
08/12/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
08/12/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
