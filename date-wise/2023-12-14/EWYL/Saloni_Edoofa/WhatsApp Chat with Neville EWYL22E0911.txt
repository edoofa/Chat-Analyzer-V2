How are you?
01/09/23, 12:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Neville, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

05/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 455 9797: yes I have but since he has resigned he can't be of much help....but I'll connect with other high school teachers and see if I'll get some students

Do you have contacts of your former school teacher or students?

I'm already reaching out
09/10/23, 10:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Neville!
How are you?
09/10/23, 10:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is fantastic news, can you share the contacts here along with the name of the school to which they belong so that I can assist accordingly?
10/10/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*
11/10/23, 8:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 8:42 am - +263 71 455 9797: thank you 😊 ✨
11/10/23, 3:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Neville, all the forms that you will now be sharing, will now go through a _pre-counseling_ process so that we filter out the students as per the details that they have mentioned, and yes, as I informed you since you are a part of the *$300 plan* your forms will be counseled on priority. Therefore, it is very necessary that all the students that you refer, primarily know:
1. What Edoofa is?
2. How Edoofa can benefit them?
3. Why are they filling out the student application form?
4. Are they aware of your journey?
11/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 455 9797: okay I understand
11/10/23, 3:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So to ensure the same, we are planning that all the students whose forms you will share, will be shown your video *highlighting your journey and experience*. There we would be required to make a short video on the same.
11/10/23, 3:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case of the absence of video, your forms will not be counseling, due to lack of video and therefore, you will not be considered for the $300 plan.
11/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 455 9797: Okay
11/10/23, 3:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
11/10/23, 3:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 455 9797: okay I will do that
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It's time to wrap up our session for today. 🌟😊 We'll pick up right where we left off next time! 👋📚 #ProgressTogether
All the best for your exam🫶🏻

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

15/11/23, 4:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Happy Wednesday!*

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni Rastogi
