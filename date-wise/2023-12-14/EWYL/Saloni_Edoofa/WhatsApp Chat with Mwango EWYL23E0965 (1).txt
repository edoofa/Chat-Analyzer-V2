04/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, do let them know to share their ideas on this!
04/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Mwango, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - +260 95 3411232: In the long run, my goal as a biochemistry student is to play a pivotal role in advancing scientific knowledge, particularly in the realm of healthcare. I aspire to contribute to groundbreaking research, with a focus on developing new drugs or therapies that can address prevalent health challenges. Beyond that, I see myself taking on leadership roles in research projects, collaborating with experts, and striving to make tangible contributions to the field.

Furthermore, my passion extends to the realm of education. I envision a future where I can share my acquired knowledge and experiences with aspiring individuals. Whether through teaching at the university level or engaging in research institutions, I aim to inspire and guide the next generation of scientists. Overall, my long-term goals revolve around making meaningful contributions to biochemistry, both in terms of scientific advancements and the mentorship of future professionals in the field.
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 95 3411232: The Edoofa "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) program aligns with my long-term goals by providing a practical avenue to support my education financially. As I engage in the program, earning credits that can be applied toward my annual university fees, it significantly reduces the financial burden associated with my studies. This financial flexibility, facilitated by the EWYL program, allows me to focus more on my biochemistry studies and research aspirations.

Moreover, the program offers a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience and practical skills, which can complement my academic knowledge. The exposure to real-world applications of biochemistry through the EWYL program could enhance my readiness to contribute meaningfully to scientific research and drug development in the long run. Overall, the financial support and experiential learning provided by EWYL create a supportive environment for me to pursue and achieve my ambitious goals in the field of biochemistry.
04/12/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have shared in-depth information about your goals really well, and I am super delighted to go through it!
04/12/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
04/12/23, 2:27 pm - +260 95 3411232: No
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
04/12/23, 2:31 pm - +260 95 3411232: I understand
04/12/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
04/12/23, 2:34 pm - +260 95 3411232: . I'll be there with the same zeal and enthusiasm at my given slot (01:30-02:30 PM) in the EWYL Group. Thank you for the reminder!

06/12/23, 1:34 pm - +260 95 3411232: I'm alright thank you and how are you?
06/12/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
06/12/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much for this acknowledgement!
06/12/23, 1:39 pm - +260 95 3411232: I'm glad and excited for today's session
06/12/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
06/12/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
06/12/23, 1:52 pm - +260 95 3411232: Yes it does
06/12/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - +260 95 3411232: Indeed it will . Let me read through it I'll tell you when I'm done

06/12/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
06/12/23, 2:12 pm - +260 95 3411232: Each section keep getting better and better
06/12/23, 2:12 pm - +260 95 3411232: I also love how he came out on the quotes <This message was edited>

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
06/12/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: How does that sound, Mwango?

06/12/23, 2:29 pm - +260 95 3411232: Indeed
06/12/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction

11/12/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Mwango, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Mwango!
11/12/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

11/12/23, 2:26 pm - +260 95 3411232: Technically  community building involves students reaching out and extending networks offering African students who have completed their final senior secondary exam the profound privilege to be an edoofian or part of the Edofa community. Giving them the opportunity to aquire that international education they need for future use and so as a student after building the community the student squires some schoolarship credits.  So the main objective of this project is to build the edoofa community
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Mwango, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

12/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
12/12/23, 1:43 pm - +260 95 3411232: Thank youu
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - +260 95 3411232: For the reminder
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Mwango/Saloni/12DEC2023*
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - +260 95 3411232: Yes
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - +260 95 3411232: I'm taking note
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - +260 95 3411232: Yes I understand
12/12/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what have you grasped from the process?
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - +260 95 3411232: To identify potential applicants, connect with Form 6 students, three divisions with 20 students each. Request access to their WhatsApp Group, share a link to your group promoting a scholarship opportunity in India (50-100% tuition fee). Repeat for each division in Form 6 and Form 5, reaching a minimum of 120 students.
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is awesome Mwango!
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:12 pm - +260 95 3411232: Thank you noted
12/12/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zambia*, where tuition fees range from ZKW 16,000 to ZWL 21,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K5000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K1200 per month↗
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: On average, parents in Zambia spend between ZKW 35,000 and ZKW 40,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course💥
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:16 pm - +260 95 3411232: Taking note
12/12/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
