Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️

I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

*TASK FOR TODAY*
I'm confident that you're already familiar with the $300 plan and that you've begun taking steps to work on it. I would like to encourage you to discuss this plan with your parents so they can be informed about this opportunity and potentially assist in easing the financial burden.

Once you've shared the details of the $300 plan with your parents, kindly ask them to acknowledge it within this group. This way, we can all be assured that we are aligned and moving forward together.
23/10/23, 10:26 am - +44 7361 911463: I think this plan is not very transparant sorry to say because after using so much data in Zimbabwe recruiting for you guys (l also helped Tafadzwa) to recruit .l would attend to people on the group  forward to you the filled forms, people would complain that you took so much time to be attend to them you know we used so much data replying to chains of messages from interested candidates and to my surprise that with that zeal noone paid.Then l have 2 whom l asked Mr Austin if l could enrol them (my nephew and niece )we paid for them though at this stage we did not know that there was an incentive for recruiting but l still feel you should have given us somethng if that was the idea because l believe my son 'school was paid .Since none from the effort that we put that time enrolled  then l dont think anyone would enroll now l gave him money to travel to schools talk to Principals of some schools at church groups we advertised then when u think yes something will come out of it then comes the shock that noone enrolled l know of some who are still asking cz there children are finishing A level ,amsure those recruited will come but to be honest l dont think we can still do it if we are using the same proceedure as last time its not transparant.
