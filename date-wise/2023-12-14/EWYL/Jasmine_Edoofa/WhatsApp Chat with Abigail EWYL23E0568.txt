Let me share a short clip about myself.
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
31/08/23, 10:31 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 10:32 am - +260 97 2957693: Yes ma'am
31/08/23, 10:45 am - +260 97 2957693: I have watched the video it was delightful thank you
31/08/23, 10:48 am - +91 78273 08969: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
31/08/23, 11:25 am - +260 97 2957693: Yes I have gotten a glimpse
31/08/23, 12:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: Before we begin understanding the projects and what we will be doing in the EWYL program, I would like to inform you that we will be meeting every weekday, Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. (Zimbabwe time).
Feel free to express if you have problems regarding the timings so that I can reschedule it so that you can be present and maximize your learning opportunities. Let's have a productive and successful journey.
31/08/23, 12:14 pm - +260 97 2957693: It will be for exactly one hour right
31/08/23, 12:14 pm - +260 97 2957693: The time is just alright
31/08/23, 12:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: It will be your responsibility to message me five minutes prior to the session to mark your attendance.
During these sessions, I will provide you with information on the EWYL program, our various projects that you can work on to earn credits, and also about our program structure.

This is known as our onboarding phase. Once the onboarding is complete, you will begin working on projects, and I will be there to guide you through any obstacles you may encounter.
31/08/23, 12:28 pm - +260 97 2957693: Yes ma'am
31/08/23, 1:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
31/08/23, 1:40 pm - +260 97 2957693: Elaborate please
31/08/23, 1:45 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our Edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
31/08/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 2957693: Oh that's interesting
31/08/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 2957693: I now fully understand
31/08/23, 3:41 pm - +91 78273 08969: That wraps up our communication for today. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead! If you have any more questions or need assistance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!

01/09/23, 9:20 am - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
01/09/23, 9:22 am - +260 96 6642819: noted
01/09/23, 9:24 am - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Abigail?
01/09/23, 9:25 am - +260 96 6642819: sounds wonderful I can't wait🙌🏼 <This message was edited>
01/09/23, 9:26 am - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
01/09/23, 9:29 am - +260 96 6642819: very much😯
01/09/23, 9:32 am - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
01/09/23, 9:32 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 9:46 am - +260 96 6642819: this was very encouraging I can't lie I really would love to receive more of these
01/09/23, 9:56 am - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
01/09/23, 9:59 am - +260 96 6642819: all the sections are interesting honestly speaking but my favourite was the quote that stated "teachers can open the door, but you must enter it yourself"
01/09/23, 10:02 am - +91 78273 08969: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
01/09/23, 10:04 am - +260 96 6642819: yes it's very inspiring and motivating being mentioned by the founder himself
01/09/23, 10:05 am - +91 78273 08969: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

19/09/23, 9:41 am - +91 78273 08969: I appreciate your efforts in sharing the form. It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team, who will now assist the student. In the meantime, it is very important that you keep regular communication with the students and address any questions they may have. Our counseling team will contact them directly within the next 15-20 days.
19/09/23, 9:41 am - +91 78273 08969: let us continue with the session now.
19/09/23, 9:42 am - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
19/09/23, 9:45 am - +260 96 6642819: yes ma'am . I'll be sending over another form for a friend later
19/09/23, 9:45 am - +260 96 6642819: for my friend or mine
19/09/23, 9:47 am - +91 78273 08969: That would be great.
19/09/23, 9:47 am - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
19/09/23, 9:50 am - +260 96 6642819: noted
19/09/23, 9:51 am - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
19/09/23, 9:54 am - +260 96 6642819: yes ma'am
19/09/23, 9:55 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 9:58 am - +260 96 6642819: the form I sent was just alright
19/09/23, 10:03 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, It was good.
19/09/23, 10:03 am - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.

19/09/23, 10:14 am - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

19/09/23, 10:42 am - +91 78273 08969: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
19/09/23, 10:43 am - +260 96 6642819: ok ma'am
19/09/23, 10:46 am - +91 78273 08969: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
 
I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

19/09/23, 2:48 pm - +91 78273 08969: Proud Edoofian, TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.

May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.

19/09/23, 2:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!




Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over *100 schools in Africa*, and over *3000 African students* are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.🙌


_Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._



Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.


The Child of the *DEO, Manicaland* Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
_*United College of Education*_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 


Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, _*Headmaster of Chibuwe High*_, the son of Ms. Christina Rockson, _The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School_, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, _DEO at Masvingo province_ are Edoofians and they have many more success stories from _St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High_, etc.

22/09/23, 12:14 pm - +260 97 2957693: How are you?
Am now all done setting up the phone. Am available for the session
22/09/23, 12:16 pm - +91 78273 08969: we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
22/09/23, 12:17 pm - +260 97 2957693: These are the all the projects
22/09/23, 12:18 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, I will let you know when you have new projects.
22/09/23, 12:19 pm - +260 97 2957693: Oh ok
22/09/23, 12:19 pm - +260 97 2957693: It's clear
22/09/23, 12:21 pm - +91 78273 08969: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
22/09/23, 12:23 pm - +260 97 2957693: Yes I am
22/09/23, 12:29 pm - +91 78273 08969: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
22/09/23, 12:31 pm - +260 97 2957693: That's interesting
22/09/23, 12:32 pm - +91 78273 08969: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
22/09/23, 12:34 pm - +260 97 2957693: Following
22/09/23, 12:45 pm - +91 78273 08969: So, Abigail, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
22/09/23, 12:47 pm - +260 97 2957693: Yes ma'am
22/09/23, 12:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username

22/09/23, 12:59 pm - +260 97 2957693: Thank you
22/09/23, 1:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- You will have your sessions on Tuesday and Friday from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm.
22/09/23, 1:00 pm - +260 97 2957693: Yes ma'am
22/09/23, 1:02 pm - +91 78273 08969: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
22/09/23, 1:03 pm - +260 97 2957693: Am following
22/09/23, 1:03 pm - +91 78273 08969: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: Edoofa EWYL.vcf (file attached)
22/09/23, 1:06 pm - +260 97 2957693: Noted
22/09/23, 1:08 pm - +91 78273 08969: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Tenzin, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
22/09/23, 1:09 pm - +260 97 2957693: Alright ma'am
22/09/23, 1:09 pm - +91 78273 08969: let me know when you are done with that.
22/09/23, 1:12 pm - +260 97 2957693: Am done
22/09/23, 1:13 pm - +91 78273 08969: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
22/09/23, 1:17 pm - +260 97 2957693: Yes ma'am
22/09/23, 1:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
22/09/23, 1:26 pm - +260 97 2957693: Yes am following
22/09/23, 1:27 pm - +91 78273 08969: From now on we will have our session as per the schedule we discuss and on Wednesday you will receive your lesson and activity on Saturday. But any queries after your session time in EWYL should be addressed here in the EWYL group. And do not forget to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual daily in your dedicated EWYL line.
Great day to you.
22/09/23, 1:29 pm - +260 97 2957693: Thanks and same
26/09/23, 10:17 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!

I am sorry to inform you that there won't be any session today as I have to attend to some urgent paperwork. Your sessions are rescheduled for tomorrow at the same time. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

09/10/23, 12:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program. 
I am dropping a video below. Do have a look at it.
