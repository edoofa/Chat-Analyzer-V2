I should add you to the group because to make sure that right information is shared to the group 

I should have this with students who are in form six or have completed the A level
21/08/23, 9:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Charles, I am impressed with your understanding.
21/08/23, 9:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
21/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 385 1617: Thank you
21/08/23, 9:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is the message -

Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Q3 Manicaland province
31/08/23, 9:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
31/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 385 1617: I agree
31/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 385 1617: Understood
31/08/23, 9:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
31/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 385 1617: I am ready and I understand
31/08/23, 9:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
31/08/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 385 1617: I promise
31/08/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 385 1617: I will do as you say
31/08/23, 9:19 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],
I hope you are in good health and high spirits.

01/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 385 1617: Thank you
15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Ok. Let's proceed. I've listened to the audio
18/09/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you
18/09/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Explain more
18/09/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Charles is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
18/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Ok understood
18/09/23, 2:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
18/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted well understood on this. You once explained this so well previously and Charles started this long back  and has been doing before he left for school
18/09/23, 2:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
18/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted. Pleased to you Ms Sanjana
18/09/23, 2:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
18/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Thank you let's proceed
18/09/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Pleased to meet you Ms Davi
18/09/23, 3:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Charles to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
18/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Like I've always said Charles is at a boarding school whereby we do not have communications with him. Only on holidays. This is a school regulations and beyond our control
18/09/23, 4:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, i want you to hear it out and share it with Charles once he is back.
18/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Noted it's all in order
18/09/23, 4:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
18/09/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Read through
19/09/23, 11:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Thanks for the reminder. Will be ready then
19/09/23, 12:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
How are you doing?
19/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Good afternoon. Sorry for not being on time, was pretty busy on something that only needed my attention. My apologies
20/09/23, 1:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Greetings!*
I hope you are doing well. This is to remind you that you have your session today from 1:30 pm onwards. So, are you ready?
20/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Greetings. Yes am ready let's proceed
20/09/23, 1:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for
Charles’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Charles?
20/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Sounds good. But The EWYL. Programs may get Charles  to a position where he can pay for his full education expenses on his own. Then maybe as parents we remain paying the semester exam registration only
20/09/23, 1:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, that is true
20/09/23, 1:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Ok it sounds super then let's move on
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 223 3391: It's alright please send the doc
20/09/23, 2:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I have shared the document.
20/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 223 3391: Fine so it means our today's session has adjourned here for tomorrow. To go over this doc ?????
20/09/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?

*It's time for the session*
22/09/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
22/09/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

22/09/23, 2:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Charles can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
22/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 223 3391: All. Noted and same page . Shall we continue thank you
22/09/23, 2:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if Charles is available. If no then, 
1. Either you put your program on hold for now and resume after you have completed your exams
2. Follow the new timetable of meeting me twice a week. 
May I know which one you choose?
22/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 223 3391: I we would want to hear from you.
 Like I've always said Charles is at a boarding school.

01/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 385 1617: Um ready for the message
01/12/23, 9:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

3. Manicaland
06/12/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
06/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 385 1617: I agree
06/12/23, 9:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.

06/12/23, 9:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
06/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 385 1617: Under stood

11/12/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
11/12/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
11/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 385 1617: How
11/12/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

11/12/23, 10:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
