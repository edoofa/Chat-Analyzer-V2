29/08/23, 10:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
Kindly come on the EWYL LINE and type *LESSON*
Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

08/11/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

08/11/23, 4:38 pm - +91 76965 03380: Evening
08/11/23, 4:38 pm - +91 76965 03380: Okay. Noted ma'am.
09/11/23, 1:03 pm - +91 76965 03380: Greetings. Diwali is one of the biggest festivals celebrated in India. It is known as the festival of lights and is observe red with great fervor across the country. Its celebrated to mark the victory of good over evil and is associated with a number of religious stories including the story of lord Rama’s return from exile after defeating the demon king Ravana. From my understanding from the Wednesday wisdom lesson, there are a lot of stories associated with Diwali for example in south India it is celebrated to mark the victory of lord Krishna over the demon Narakasura. But in all these stories there’s one common theme, -The triumph of good over evil. It is not only just a religious festival but also a cultural one, people celebrate it by lighting crackers. As I move around my locality, I have observed people decorating their houses and it really fills the community with a sense of oneness. 

HAPPY DIWALI TO THE EDOOFA COMMUNITY

06/12/23, 3:56 pm - +91 76965 03380: 1.) I have understood the document for the $300 plan
2.) I think the problem I'm facing is that 15-20 days for the counselling team to attend to applicants is a little bit of a long period, the students tend to get impatient and start doubting my authenticity when communicating with them.
3.) December is a fruitful month since most students will be on holidays so I think I would Target $300 for December.
4.)I would manage to submit 5 forms per week.
06/12/23, 3:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is a great goal, Thomas. 
Yes, I can undersatmd that the waiting time is a bit long but I hope you understand that we have to reach out to alot of students.

09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine

13/12/23, 1:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
