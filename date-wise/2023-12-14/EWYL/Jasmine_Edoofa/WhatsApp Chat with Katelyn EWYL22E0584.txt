Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, 
*IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION*
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 89688 47287: Good evening ma'am , we can start
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know were you not aware of the session timings?
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - +91 89688 47287: I was aware ma'am but my network is not stable
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 89688 47287: Yes ma'am I'm very excited
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge, that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 89688 47287: Yes ma'am I do remember
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 89688 47287: But if I'm not mistaken it was 900usd grant making it 300 annually
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me check
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, you are correct Katelyn
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted ma'am
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - +91 89688 47287: We may proceed
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - +91 89688 47287: No ma'am , may you kindly tell me please
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:58 pm - +91 89688 47287: Understood ma'am its clear
27/11/23, 4:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 4:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 4:03 pm - +91 89688 47287: Ok ma'am
27/11/23, 4:04 pm - +91 89688 47287: And how do I do this
27/11/23, 4:04 pm - +91 89688 47287: ☺️☺️it has also been a great pleasure and blessing having you as my mentor
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I will let you know
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is really sweet Katelyn
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 4:06 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted ma'am
27/11/23, 4:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 4:12 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted ma'am we can proceed
27/11/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 4:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted ma'am crystal clear
27/11/23, 4:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program for a while - which was to become 

A) Job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors and the constant industrial exposure - webinars)
B) Self-financing your education (via earning scholarship credits by working on the projects consistently).
27/11/23, 4:18 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted ma'am , I understand
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I move ahead, May I know if you have any questions that you would like to ask?
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - +91 89688 47287: So far ma'am I have no questions
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - +91 89688 47287: Everything is clear
27/11/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 4:22 pm - +91 89688 47287: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful, Katelyn. I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $900 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now are $63. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted maam
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - +91 89688 47287: So how else do I increase my scholarship credits
27/11/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I will help you on this Katelyn
27/11/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - +91 89688 47287: Yes ma'am I'm ready
27/11/23, 4:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted maam.
27/11/23, 4:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
27/11/23, 4:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:43 pm - +91 89688 47287: Ooh ok , noted ma'am
27/11/23, 4:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
27/11/23, 4:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 5:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. 
Since we have not completed the session, I will schdule one more session tomorrow. Make sure you are on time. 
Goodnight!
28/11/23, 10:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon* @918968847287 @263772753404 
I hope you are doing well. 
_*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_
This is to remind you that since we were unable to complete our discussion yesterday. *I have scheduled one last session for you.*
Make sure you come on time. 
I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. 

*Date: 28/11/2023*
*Time: 6:00 PM IST*
28/11/23, 1:52 pm - +91 89688 47287: Good afternoon ma'am
28/11/23, 1:52 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted
28/11/23, 2:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening Katelyn*
I hope you are doing well. 

May I know do you remember our yesterday;s conversation?
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 89688 47287: Good evening ma'am , yes I remember
28/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 275 3404: Afternoon is there any chance that scholarship will exceed the grant have been following it seems the credits are always low,,and how
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The situation is entirely dependent on Katelyn. Currently, you have the opportunity to earn $100 immediately if any of her students pays the enrollment fees. If she succeeds in bringing in 5 students under similar circumstances, the grant amount will naturally increase.
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - +91 89688 47287: Ma'am I would like to know if the students I submitted before coming add to my scholarship credits
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Definitely Katelyn
28/11/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: But, Those students will be evaluated under normal 50$ plan.
28/11/23, 3:06 pm - +91 89688 47287: Ok ma'am
28/11/23, 3:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - +91 89688 47287: So does this mean that from all the students I've submitted before none of them has paid the enrollment fee
28/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted
28/11/23, 3:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You have earned 63$ so far.
28/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 275 3404: On this one what do you say
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, They have paid, that is why she has earned 63$
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 275 3404: How much is this is it $63?
28/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 275 3404: I think you have to be open   on how many students have paid , and how she get 63
28/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 275 3404: When students have paid
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - +91 89688 47287: Ooohk so then does it mean that the sep to oct November progress does not count
28/11/23, 3:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes
28/11/23, 3:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me check
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 275 3404: I think for  her  ,to put effort   it must be open ,and I know she can
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let us proceed with the sesison.
I will get back to you on the credits by tomorrow.
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted ma'am
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - +91 89688 47287: Yes ma'am , I'm really dedicated to this and would like to achieve my goals
28/11/23, 4:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion. We've assessed your performance from *September to December*, and currently, you are not eligible to redeem the grant due to your past performance. *However, with one month remaining, if you actively participate in all calls, sessions, and webinars, there's a chance you could become eligible*.

Furthermore, I encourage you to focus on engaging in projects to accumulate scholarship credits for yourself.
28/11/23, 4:14 pm - +91 89688 47287: Noted ma'am
28/11/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Indeed, Katelyn, our conversation regarding the grant has concluded.

07/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 275 3404: From what I have seen,this issue is about  the points she is getting and 5he time she spent it's not matching
07/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 275 3404: Even my self I don't understand with the whole input she puts then she still on $63

09/12/23, 7:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I can understand that you have been patient for a very long time. Please be patient and I will share the complete break up by Monday <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 8:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 8:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 8:08 am - +263 77 275 3404: I think  this thing. It's not being taken well
09/12/23, 8:10 am - +263 77 275 3404: Are you saying the grant have been withdrawn?be open on that so that we can move on
09/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 275 3404: 3. Only if. It's   to the benefit of both of us ,but if it's one sided  ,it's not worth the fight
09/12/23, 8:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening! Let me clarify the situation. There are two distinct aspects:

1. *$300 Plan for Community Building:* Katelyn had the chance to earn $300 by working on the Community Building project. The more effort she puts in, the more credits she can earn.

2. *21-Day Grant Challenge:* Back there in Africa, Katelyn participated in a grant challenge that lasted for 21 days. Following the grant, certain terms and conditions were outlined in the grant letter. One condition specified that she must maintain attendance of more than 75% in both the EWYL sessions and webinars. Unfortunately, she has not met this requirement until November. As a result, she is currently ineligible for the grant.
09/12/23, 8:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me share, Katelyn's report card with you of the EWYL Program
09/12/23, 8:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 8:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 8:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Out of all her applications shared, 2 students enrolled in Aygust 2023 and one student enrolled in March 2023. I hope things have gottena bit clearer. 
If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
09/12/23, 8:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
10/12/23, 8:07 am - +263 77 275 3404: So  on 2 on attendence was they no communication ? The reason s why she failed to make the attendance?
10/12/23, 8:09 am - +91 89688 47287: Good morning , it would have been nicer if you shared on how the attendence is being calculated
10/12/23, 8:09 am - +263 77 275 3404: And I don't know how a normal person can get 8 cents per month on a full month
10/12/23, 8:11 am - +91 89688 47287: and also it seems like irregardless of my attendance , I can only qualify to get the grant if I continue bringing in students and in this case no students have been submitted meaning I don't qualify ...
11/12/23, 7:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, @918968847287 @263772753404 
I hope you are doing well.

11/12/23, 7:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 7:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you've thoroughly reviewed the grant document. As you've noticed, it's crucial to uphold attendance of at least 75%. Attendance is evaluated based on two factors: participation in EWYL sessions/calls and attendance at webinars.
11/12/23, 7:29 am - +263 77 275 3404: So how many lessons was she supposed to attend  ?and how many she didn't attend?
11/12/23, 7:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I agree, but it depends upon the hard work a student puts in. Some students earn nothing in a month but on the other hand, some students earn 250-300$ every month.
11/12/23, 7:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This is Katelyn's attendance from the month of September, October, and November.
11/12/23, 7:33 am - +263 77 275 3404: What percentage is this
11/12/23, 7:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: 7/10 - 70%
5/8 - 62.5%
11/12/23, 7:36 am - +263 77 275 3404: And if you go with charts  she what's put challenges with network
11/12/23, 7:36 am - +263 77 275 3404: But u never consider that
11/12/23, 7:36 am - +263 77 275 3404: So in short fees for this coming term you are not assisting
11/12/23, 7:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This statement is inaccurate. Students accumulate credits by engaging in projects to support themselves. Grant eligibility is determined by maintaining attendance, and given that your attendance is currently below 75% in both sessions and webinars until November, you are not eligible for the grant.
11/12/23, 7:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It's disheartening to learn that you perceive my efforts this way. I'm willingly dedicating my extra time to provide clarity. I suggest reaching out to Katelyn initially because her attendance appears to fall short. 

While I acknowledge that network issues can arise, I encourage you to review our conversations and note how frequently she has cited this as a reason. If her network is problematic during a session, she had the option to inform me afterward about the challenges she faced in attending the session. Please check that how many times has she tried to reach out to me.
11/12/23, 7:51 am - +263 77 275 3404: When I see something like this inever knew what you will have agreed,but I'm also a parent who dose my  want a child to mis lesson for no reason,and I think if they is a problem about not doing her lessons I don't have a problem about her coming back because the reason why she is there is to have a better future not a problem
11/12/23, 7:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I would consider this. Before that I would want Katelyn to share her school timetable with me. 
I am more than willing to make changes according to her timetable.
11/12/23, 8:08 am - +263 77 275 3404: This message was deleted
11/12/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 275 3404: From Kate she  said she always communicate with you but after communication you mark her absent,so  she feels hard done ,so I think for now will do here payment s without looking for help elsewhere
11/12/23, 4:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, 
Yes, That would be great. Also, @918968847287 Kindly go ahead and share your school timetable with me.
11/12/23, 8:11 pm - +91 89688 47287: Good evening
11/12/23, 8:12 pm - +91 89688 47287: My time table is
 Monday 1pm to 5pm 
Tuesday to Friday 10am to 5pm
13/12/23, 11:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

13/12/23, 12:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *GRANT UPDATE*
Well, December is coming to an end, and the grant eligibility mystery is soon going to be revealed.  As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know how is the progress going through these short assessments:

⭕ I am sure as discussed, we planned on making weekly targets. May I know how you plan this week in terms of the number of forms you will be sharing and target scholarship credits for December after you see your performance table?

*Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Looking forward to your response.
13/12/23, 1:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
