15/09/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Yes we are
18/09/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
18/09/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am dropping a video that will help you know me a little better.
18/09/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Thank you go ahead
18/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Let me wait for it to download save for network blues, huh!
18/09/23, 3:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You can watch it after the session. Let us proceed
18/09/23, 3:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Better if you state them for my benefit
18/09/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Promise is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
18/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Thank you for opening and I am following!
18/09/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees
18/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 436 9494: I see and its quite understandable.
18/09/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
18/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Thank you
18/09/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 436 9494: That's really enjoyable
19/09/23, 11:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 11:42 am - +263 78 217 9558: Morning to you. Thank you for the reminder
19/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 217 9558: Good afternoon
19/09/23, 2:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afteroon
19/09/23, 2:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Shall we start?
19/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 217 9558: Yes
19/09/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Faith to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
19/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 217 9558: I am following
19/09/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
19/09/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 217 9558: I am through
19/09/23, 2:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
19/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 217 9558: No problem
19/09/23, 2:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I now is it clear?
19/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 217 9558: Very clear mam.
19/09/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. Have a wonderful day ahead!
19/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 217 9558: Surely it was nice having you on the session. Good day.
20/09/23, 1:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Greetings!*
I hope you are doing well. This is to remind you that you have your session today from 1:30 pm onwards. So, are you ready?
20/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 217 9558: Eish mam sorry for not responding in time. I got tied up with work. How are you.
05/10/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_*
I hope you are doing well. I would like to tell you that we have been connected for so long but we haven't really finished our introduction. I would kindly suggest you to please connect with me today for 2 hours so that we can move to the next stage. 
Kindly acknowledge and let me know.
05/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Have jus received your communique. Plz go ahead
06/10/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, May I know that were you able to read this document?
06/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Unfortunately my mobile developed some challenges n it took me time trying to fix it n eventually had to replace it. This resulted in loss of everything which was pending including this document! I am not so sure with my spouse since we work in two different towns. Could you please kindly resend if it's possible
06/10/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure
06/10/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Really
06/10/23, 2:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You can definitely read the document after the session Mr. James
06/10/23, 2:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Promise can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
06/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 436 9494: I definitely have no challenge with that
06/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Yes we are
06/10/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if is Promise available for the sessions that will be held twice a week.
06/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Like you once pointed out last, I was of the idea that we complete these initial stages with you since he is fully committed to his Advanced level exams
06/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 436 9494: He won't be able to attend these sessions owing to the commitment I referred above
06/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Once again I am no longer able to connect you but this my text are being uploaded!
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, May I know when will Promise come for the sessions?
06/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 436 9494: Promise himself will only be available for sessions after exams that after mid November, let me furnish you with the exact date once I have confirmed with his Examinations Statement of Entry
06/10/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure, Will you be able to do it by tomorrow?
06/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 436 9494: I thot we can move on n as long as our network allows us, we can
06/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 436 9494: I have jus browsed through the above document and honestly speaking we went thru it, the three of us: my spouse, myself and Promise, long back when he (Promise) was still around.
06/10/23, 4:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We have completed our introduction, and now I just wanted to know if Promise was available or not. But, like you said he is not, So we can put the sessions on hold for a while.
06/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 436 9494: It's fine thank you.
10/10/23, 1:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
