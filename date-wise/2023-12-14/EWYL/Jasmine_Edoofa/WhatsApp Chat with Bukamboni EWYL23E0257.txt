You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

28/08/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Yes I'm ready for it
28/08/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/08/23, 2:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
28/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Refers to the process of establishing and strengthening connections and shared identities with a specific community.
It's purpose is to create a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation. The main objective of this project is for me to develop networking and persuasive skills. I will therefore identify motivated youths. This project also encourages me to adopt the mindset of identifying opportunities to make positive impacts on others. I will therefore need to connect with African students who have finished their senior secondary level. throughout the project Edoofa will provide guidance to ensure my success. This project will allow me to own scholarship credits by referring students to the Edoofa program. For every successful step I will earn scholarship credit.
29/08/23, 12:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
I hope you are doing well.

29/08/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Ok there is no problem
29/08/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That’s awesome- Bukamboni, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

29/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Yes
29/08/23, 1:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-

 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.

29/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Ok understandable
29/08/23, 2:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
29/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Yes you can go on please
29/08/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
29/08/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 2:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 665 9518: I will first have to create a WhatsApp group and identify the right students who can be part of that group. The goal is to reach a number of students and provide with them necessary information about Edoofa. Therefore to get the right students I must first start up with my schoolmates who are currently in form 6 or who have completed the Advanced level. I can therefore ask them to create an official WhatsApp group chart and add me and share the link to the group. I then share the information about pursing higher education in India to a large audience and of course using less energy. I will therefore add you as the mentor in the group to check the information being shared
29/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Oh thus really good, have a good day tomorrow
31/08/23, 1:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Ok, its good
31/08/23, 1:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
31/08/23, 1:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Ok thus good
31/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 665 9518: So its him at the center
31/08/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Bukamboni
31/08/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Ok
31/08/23, 1:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
31/08/23, 1:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Ok so thus the third project, allow me to listen to it
31/08/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
31/08/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 665 9518: In this lat project my task is to to reach out local schools and connect with with the headmasters and introduce them to the Edoofa program
31/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 665 9518: In this project my task is to reach out to local schools in my region and connect with headmasters to introduce them to the Edoofa program. To start with I first list all the senior secondary schools, starting with my school of course. I can therefore reach the headmasters either by WhatsApp or by phone call. I share why I have planned to join the Edoofa, and explain how I have planned the future and share the Edoofa details with them. I then find out if they are interested in setting an online meeting with the Edoofa directors. After this I then share their phone details to the EWYL mentor, in this case its you Jasmine using the format provided.
31/08/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Bukamboni
31/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Thank you very much
31/08/23, 2:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
31/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Yes
31/08/23, 2:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now it was lovely talking to you dear. I will see you tomorrow. 
Take Care and Have a lovely day ahead!
31/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Thank you very much have a nice day too
01/09/23, 1:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon,* 
I hope you are doing well. 
We are about to start our session in 30 minutes. So are you ready?
01/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Ok
01/09/23, 2:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Additionally, EDOOFA's Earn While You Learn Program helps students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation by providing opportunities to learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
01/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Ues
01/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Yes
01/09/23, 2:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: In Zimbabwe alone, EDOOFA has enrolled more than 1,500 students in the program within the last year. Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.
01/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Thus really good work
01/09/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(Ph.D.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
01/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Ok
01/09/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
01/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 665 9518: So it means it must be above $100
01/09/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
01/09/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
01/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Ok
01/09/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Bukamboni- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
01/09/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, It is time to wrap up the session. Our next session is scheduled for *Monday at 1:30 p.m.*

Until then, please take good care, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend ahead.
01/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Thank you very much
02/09/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 665 9518: Good evening, yes I have sent the message to the 2 email addresses
04/09/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Bukamboni

08/09/23, 2:55 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
15/09/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
21/10/23, 5:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening,
I hope everything is going well for you. I understand that your child isn't currently available to begin the "Earn While You Learn" program. However, I'd like to suggest if you could complete the initial orientation part with me today.

Could you let me know if this is possible for you?
21/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 245 8180: Ooh thank you very much for checking on me. Yes Bukamboni is not yet available to begin his Earn While You Learn program. I agree with your suggestion to complete his initial orientation part, because I'm now available.
21/10/23, 9:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since I will be connected to your child for the longest period and I will be their mentor, guide, and friend throughout the journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when they are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
21/10/23, 9:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 9:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up. We will meet for the session tomorrow.

07/12/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
