As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

I hope you haven’t forgotten about date
06/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Arnold!

Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 2:35 pm - +91 92895 96091: Success
06/12/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: No, think harder Arnold!
06/12/23, 2:39 pm - +91 92895 96091: Hard work
06/12/23, 2:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, no it's a "KEYBOARD"
06/12/23, 2:43 pm - +91 92895 96091: Oh yes I get it now mam
06/12/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - +91 92895 96091: Yes mam
06/12/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
06/12/23, 3:11 pm - +91 92895 96091: Tell me more mam
06/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
06/12/23, 3:13 pm - +91 92895 96091: Please tell me mam
06/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
06/12/23, 3:22 pm - +91 92895 96091: I understand now mam
06/12/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
06/12/23, 3:40 pm - +91 92895 96091: I will do it mam
06/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :
06/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Career Exploration:*
Students can use LinkedIn to explore various career paths by following companies, organizations, and professionals in their chosen industries.
Access to diverse profiles and career journeys can help students make more informed decisions about their own career paths.
*Job and Internship Opportunities:*
Employers often use LinkedIn to post job and internship opportunities. Students can leverage the platform to find relevant openings and apply directly.
Building a strong LinkedIn profile increases the likelihood of recruiters discovering and reaching out to students for potential opportunities.
*Showcasing Skills and Accomplishments:*
LinkedIn allows students to showcase their academic achievements, skills, and extracurricular activities on a professional platform.
This can be an effective way to differentiate oneself from peers and demonstrate qualifications to potential employers.
*Researching Companies and Industries:*
Students can use LinkedIn to research companies and industries they are interested in. Following companies provides updates on their activities, culture, and job openings.
Staying informed about industry trends and company developments is crucial for making informed career decisions.
*Learning from Professionals:*
Following industry leaders and professionals on LinkedIn allows students to stay updated on industry trends, insights, and thought leadership.
Engaging with relevant content can contribute to continuous learning and provide valuable perspectives.
*Building a Personal Brand:*
Crafting a professional LinkedIn profile helps students build a personal brand online.
A well-curated profile, including a professional photo, a compelling headline, and a well-written summary, can make a positive impression on recruiters and potential connections.
*Recommendations and Endorsements:*
LinkedIn allows users to receive recommendations and endorsements from professors, colleagues, or supervisors.
Positive recommendations and endorsements can add credibility to a student's profile and provide evidence of their skills and work ethic.
*Joining Professional Groups:*
LinkedIn offers various professional groups and communities where students can engage in discussions, ask questions, and stay updated on industry news.
Joining these groups can expand a student's network and provide valuable insights into their chosen field.
*Long-term Career Planning:*
LinkedIn is not just for immediate job searches but can also be a tool for long-term career planning. Students can set up job alerts, follow companies for future opportunities, and stay connected with their network even after graduation.

06/12/23, 3:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, do you have a LinkedIn account? If yes, could you please share the link with me? I would like to review your profile and suggest some improvements if necessary.

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽

Best regards,
Team EWYL
