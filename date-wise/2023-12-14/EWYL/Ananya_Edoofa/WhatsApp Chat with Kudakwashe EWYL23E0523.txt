How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🛩️
23/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Hello mam!How are you?

I am doing okay
23/08/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect lately, I was not feeling well.
23/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Ohhh okay mam

I hope you are feeling well?
23/08/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am better!
23/08/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 084 7544: If you can enlighten me on the 2 objectives mam
23/08/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/08/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Thank you l am quite enlightening!
23/08/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
23/08/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Ohhhh wonderful!
23/08/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/08/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Looking forward to working very well with them!
23/08/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/08/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session here. We shall now connect tomorrow to move forward with our journey!🛩️

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Kudakwashe?
24/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Ohh thank you mam!
These goals sound amazing and will try and make sure that all are met especially the first one.
24/08/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
24/08/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*

29/08/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
29/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Good afternoon mam
29/08/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
29/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Yes yes!
29/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Okay mam
29/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
29/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
29/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
29/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

29/08/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tomorrow is the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, a significant religious festival in our culture. On this day, brothers and sisters come together to celebrate the special bond they share. Sisters tie a protective thread, known as a rakhi, around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing love, care, and the promise of protection.

How are you?
31/08/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
31/08/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

09/09/23, 10:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings my Proud Edoofian!

Since schools are now open, and I don't want you to be diverted from your studies, I would like to ask about your schedule. This will help me plan our proceedings accordingly and ensure that we can stay connected even if you cannot attend your sessions.🤝🏽
09/09/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 084 7544: Good morning mam

Yes l am attending school from 7am up to 3pm then have extra classes from 4pm to 7pm
11/09/23, 1:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kudakwashe! 

Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your school. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
11/09/23, 1:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my school.

I have sent the email
15/09/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
*Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 084 7544: Good afternoon mam.
I hope l find you well

My parents will be available for the 8:30 am to 9:30 am slot thus from Monday to Wednesday
15/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 246 7187: Sorry let's make it 2.00pm to 3;00pm since l will be in a workshop in the morning
16/09/23, 7:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Kudakwashe!

You know, I am available today at 8:30 a.m. Shall we connect at that time?
16/09/23, 8:07 am - +263 78 084 7544: Yes mam it’s fine
16/09/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents!

How are you doing today?
16/09/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 902 5265: Good morning, we are well, thank you.
16/09/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Are we ready to move ahead?
16/09/23, 8:40 am - +263 77 246 7187: Good morning how are you?
16/09/23, 8:40 am - +263 77 246 7187: Yes we are!
16/09/23, 8:41 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
16/09/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 246 7187: Do you mind explaining project 1 so that l get a clear picture?
16/09/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/09/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 246 7187: Well understood
16/09/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
16/09/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
16/09/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
16/09/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 246 7187: Yes definitely!
16/09/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
16/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 084 7544: Ohhh woww!
This seems educative and exciting as well!
16/09/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed! *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
16/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 084 7544: Okay.
So l will be carrying this out simultaneously with my projects?
16/09/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: You will get to learn all during while working on your projects.
16/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 084 7544: Okay mam.
Well understood
16/09/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
16/09/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 084 7544: Yes we are on the same page
16/09/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday- 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
16/09/23, 9:26 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
16/09/23, 9:26 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
16/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 084 7544: Noted mam and l have sent the message
16/09/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Kudakwashe’s involvement in the EWYL program can bring the student closer to reaching their career goals.

As per our discussion, Kudakwashe will resume his EWYL Process on 1st November. I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with him/her and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
19/10/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

31/10/23, 7:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Parents and Kudakwashe!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

I'm delighted to inform you that we have made another step towards our focus on employability and have effectively organized a *series of webinars* featuring a few  *amazing speakers from Africa*🤩 that our students in India have received the opportunity to attend. 

This effort ensures that our students are provided with abundant opportunities and exposure to enrich their learning experiences.🚀

Our recent webinars have covered *job-ready skills*, 21st-century skills- communication, networking, and more, and key focus topics like *plagiarism awareness and CV building.*

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
