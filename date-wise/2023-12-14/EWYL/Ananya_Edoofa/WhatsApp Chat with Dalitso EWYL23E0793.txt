*Dear Mentor, my name is Dalitso Dominic Banda, and my EWYL group name is Dalitso EWYL23E0793. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (24th of October) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
01/12/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @260771023019 

I hope you are doing well. I have observed that there is a slight delay in commencing our EWYL program together. You know, I was occupied with an orientation program that took place at our various partner universities. In order to welcome all of my students, I visited each of those universities personally, which are in different cities. Following this, I was not feeling well and was under the weather for quite some time.

Kindly excuse me for the delay; however, now that I am fully recovered, I am all set to begin our EWYL journey together, along with a lot of exciting opportunities. We will start by understanding our projects and then work together to earn maximum scholarship credits so that you can finance your own education while learning 21st-century job skills!

So, are you ready to move forward with me on this exciting journey and conquer the world?🚀
01/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 771023019: Yes am ready please 🙂
01/12/23, 4:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟
01/12/23, 4:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Get ready with your introduction, as I can't wait to learn more about you! 🌟
01/12/23, 5:36 pm - +260 771023019: Alright sure !
04/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Let's start our session with an interesting tidbit about India. Did you know that the concept of 'zero' (0) as a mathematical digit was invented by Indian mathematician Aryabhata?

It's a remarkable contribution that has had a profound impact on mathematics and science globally. 🤯
04/12/23, 1:41 pm - +260 771023019: To introduce myself.....
My name is Dalitso Banda, A Proud edoofian from Zambia, I am about to pursue my bachelors degree in Nutrition and Dietetics in India. I keen interest in musical instruments especially the drums. Immediately I completed my secondary school I started lookin for a part time job for me to secure some money in readiness for my higher education.so I worked in an Internet cafe where I use to do sales work and stationary work.
04/12/23, 1:42 pm - +260 771023019: Wow that’s a fun fact!!
04/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, drums? That's awesome! 🥁

Any chance I could see you in action? A drum video would be awesome if you're up for it! <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 1:49 pm - +260 771023019: Unfortunately I don’t have videos of my self playing but that will be possible next week when I go for practice
04/12/23, 1:53 pm - +260 771023019: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, that's really impressive, Dalitso! Have you played for your school band?
04/12/23, 1:56 pm - +260 771023019: Yes I have
04/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I must say I have picked such a talented student!🏆
04/12/23, 2:00 pm - +260 771023019: Wow thank you Miss Ananya😊
04/12/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I kindly ask you to invite your parents to join the group so that they can _actively participate in your progress and share in the achievements you will make._ I am providing you with the link once again so that you can extend the invitation to them. Once your parents have joined the group, we can embark on this thrilling journey together!
04/12/23, 2:01 pm - +260 771023019: Okey
04/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
04/12/23, 2:15 pm - +260 771023019: Can you brief me with them please?
04/12/23, 2:16 pm - +260 771023019: Am waiting for the link so that my parents can join please

04/12/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we close today's session, let me leave you with a thought: 'The only way to do great work is to love what you do.' - Steve Jobs. Let this inspire us for tomorrow. Until then, take care, and let us connect tomorrow.🧠🏆
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - +260 771023019: Thank you!!

05/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"🐝
05/12/23, 1:43 pm - +260 771023019: Wow😅 that’s a fun fact !!
05/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
05/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/12/23, 1:50 pm - +260 771023019: Well understood !!
05/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
05/12/23, 1:55 pm - +260 771023019: Alright I am so eager to start this journey😊
05/12/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
05/12/23, 1:58 pm - +260 771023019: Yes very interesting
05/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
05/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:09 pm - +260 771023019: Am done reading the newsletter.... this is very good piece of information
05/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
05/12/23, 2:15 pm - +260 771023019: The Edoofa hall of inspiration: that speech precious gave is so inspiring to people and encourages us to know who we are and be proud of who we are.
And also the three quotes especially the one by Richard Branson that tells us that life is about learning something new everyday.
05/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
05/12/23, 2:17 pm - +260 771023019: Indeed it is!!
05/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Dalitso?
05/12/23, 2:20 pm - +260 771023019: It sounds great @918800325457
05/12/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

06/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 2:58 pm - +260 771023019: Sorry for the reply this is when am seeing the message
06/12/23, 2:59 pm - +260 771023019: The answer to that riddle is a keyboard 🤞🏾
06/12/23, 4:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting the response from your end during our session timing only, however, since it is over now we shall continue in our next session.
06/12/23, 5:08 pm - +260 771023019: I had responded but I saw your text late because of network
07/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
07/12/23, 6:05 pm - +260 771023019: Wow I also used to be scared of this day!
08/12/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Dalitso!

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. Let us connect on Monday now, as we do not have our sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀
08/12/23, 9:47 am - +260 771023019: Happy weekend to you too
11/12/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 1:33 pm - +260 771023019: Okeyyy
11/12/23, 1:34 pm - +260 771023019: Just wanted to let you know that We have a power cut here and my phone is about to switch off 😪
11/12/23, 1:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you use your parent's phone?
11/12/23, 1:37 pm - +260 771023019: Yes I can
11/12/23, 1:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's great, attend the session from your parent's phone then!
11/12/23, 1:47 pm - +260 97 7155187: Hey Dalitso here 👋
11/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
11/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:51 pm - +260 97 7155187: Yes it is
11/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
11/12/23, 2:04 pm - +260 97 7155187: I'll do that immediately I finish reading the document
11/12/23, 2:25 pm - +260 97 7155187: So this document basically talks about how the EWYL helps students gain 21st century skills and how to apply them in today's life and it also talks about how students gain credits for each successful project and this actually relieves parents on the fees
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, Daltiso!🌟
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so let us conclude today's session here, I am really happy with your performance so far! Keep up the good work, and I promise no one can stop you from reaching heights! 

Now let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Good day!☀️
11/12/23, 2:29 pm - +260 97 7155187: Okey Good day to you too❤️
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Daltiso!

Did you know octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two pumps to the gills, and one to the body. They're basically the rockstars of the ocean with a unique sense of style! Now, let's dive into our session with that octopus energy!🐙
12/12/23, 1:35 pm - +260 771023019: Yes please !😁
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to listen to the audio?
12/12/23, 1:37 pm - +260 771023019: Yes I did it’s basically what’s in the document
12/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - +260 771023019: So the audio was basically explaining more on the projects in detail like the first one which is the *CORPORATE ALLIANCES * 
So in this project students are requiredto undestand the market in which you’re going to work in the future and start preparing for it at a very early stage. So students are also required to create a LinkedIn Account which is a business platform where we can look for for companies and employees that are working for those certain companies then we can connect with the decision makers of these companies by arranging for a meeting with Edoofa that is sharing the meeting time with the Edoofa team so that you can enlighten them or talk to them better about the business aspects that will be created once we’ve formed this alliance!
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, Dalitso. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - +260 771023019: From my understanding 
This document gives us a guide on searching for companies,so, there are four factors we need to consider when choosing the right company which are
*Nature of company 
*scale of company
*financial stability 
*background of founder 
So the document also talks about the platforms that can be used when choosing these companies.
It also talks about the 6 steps that we must follow in keeping the four factors into consideration!
12/12/23, 2:18 pm - +260 771023019: You can help by enlightening me if I’ve missed anything please!
12/12/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Daltiso, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - +260 771023019: Thank you very much😁
12/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
