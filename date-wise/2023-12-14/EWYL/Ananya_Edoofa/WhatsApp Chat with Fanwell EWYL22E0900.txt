Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect yesterday for our session as I was preparing for the arrival of our 2023 intake students!

However, I have rescheduled your session for tomorrow at 9:30 AM, and I am sharing our weekly newsletter with you, which we will be discussing tomorrow. I hope to see you there!
01/08/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 1:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my Proud Edoofian!

You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?
04/08/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 076 0225: For now ma'am  I'm waiting for my admission officer mr Shivjeet to tell me the date of arrival
05/08/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am,  I'm waiting
05/08/23, 10:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that you have been quite occupied with your preparations. However, I would still appreciate it if you stay connected on your EWYL Line. This will allow me to share lessons and activities with you, and whenever you can find some time, you can share your responses. This way, your attendance can be maintained.

So, kindly follow your EWYL ritual so that I can share your activities with you!
05/08/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am thank you
12/08/23, 11:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

14/08/23, 9:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

I am waiting for you on your EWYL line, kindly join me there to proceed with your session!
16/08/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Greetings ma'am
16/08/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, how are you today?
16/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 076 0225: I'm fine ma'am and you
16/08/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Yes ma'am I'm ready
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am i agree with you
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Yes ma'am
16/08/23, 3:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Yes ma'am  i understand on that, but we were faced challenges,so  that's why sometimes  we didn't meet those targets
16/08/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am thank you i believe and confidential that, i  can surpass grant amount by own schoolarship credits by  being hardworking
16/08/23, 3:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 3:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am
16/08/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/08/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright i will rewiew to them
16/08/23, 3:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟
24/08/23, 8:26 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings my Proud Edoofian!

I hope you're doing well. I want to let you know that there's something we need to address concerning your grant. I need to tell you that today is the last day to submit the signed grant document.

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳

25/11/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_URGENT_*
Good afternoon, Fanwell!

Since we have not been able to complete our $300 training session with me. However, since this means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey, I am here sharing the grant document with you and something discussed during the training.

So, I would like you to read and provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. Only after this will you be provided with the "Certified Student Leader" certificate.
25/11/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *1. Different channels for finding potential students*

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
25/11/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
25/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am.....i understood thank you

27/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am thank you
28/11/23, 8:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Fanwell!

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

*Time: 6:00 PM*
28/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am
28/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Hello ma'am we have a lesson
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Fanwell!
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $100 annually. 
Do you remember this?
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Greetings ma'am how are you doing
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Yes ma'am I'm still remembering
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well,on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
28/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Yeah still recalling a little bit not all
28/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Oky ma'am i understand  the guidelines
28/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Oky ma'am but basically for the past day you were not available
28/11/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Fanwell, since you came late here in India, we are giving you another chance. Therefore, you have a golden opportunity to start looking at your sessions and webinar numbers from now. We will take some time to evaluate your performance and engagement. Is that alright?
28/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am i understand  thank you
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Not only this, I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am can you explain a little
28/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am.......now i understood
28/11/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.

I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 076 0225: 10 quality forms its too much ma'am  but if you reduce it to 5 forms ,so that it Will be easy
28/11/23, 3:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Fanwell, What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
28/11/23, 3:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am it's fine,if you say soo i promise to be consistent and dedicate
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to share fact with you that many of you are not realizing, while the grant amount is limited, there's no cap on earning scholarship credits.
Recognizing your potential, I will help in personal training to help you to accumulate substantial scholarship credits. Although you're currently ineligible for the grant, with two months left—November and December—ensure your attendance at every session and webinar from this point onward.
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As of now, I am concluding our discussion, and I am hoping for a powerful December where we will work hard and make your parents proud.🤝🏽🏆
28/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Okay ma'am  thank you , have a nice evening
29/11/23, 1:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Wednesday, Proud Edoofian!_*

09/12/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle_*

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 076 0225: I am a proud edoofian
09/12/23, 4:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Why are you late, Fanwell?
09/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 076 0225: I don't have Indian line , so want my friend to hotspot me
09/12/23, 5:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
09/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am  ....I'm waiting
09/12/23, 5:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
09/12/23, 5:13 pm - +263 78 076 0225: No ma'am
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
09/12/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ,now i understood
09/12/23, 5:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
09/12/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ma'am , I will
09/12/23, 5:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, as we are finishing today's session, I want you to update your LinkedIn profile and share the link with me this week so that I can help you with it.

You can refer to this video!

09/12/23, 5:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Saturday: Let's Practice Microsoft Excel_*

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

*Activity Instructions:*

⭕Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

⭕Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

⭕Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

⭕Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

⭕Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

⭕Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

⭕Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

⭕Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). 

Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

13/12/23, 1:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Wednesday!_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽
