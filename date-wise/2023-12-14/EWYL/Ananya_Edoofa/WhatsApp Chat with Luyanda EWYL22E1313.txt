12/08/23, 10:51 am - +91 78273 08969: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

16/08/23, 10:14 am - +91 78273 08969: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 408 6291: Yes I am ready
16/08/23, 10:17 am - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.

16/08/23, 10:20 am - +91 78273 08969: Please share.
16/08/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 408 6291: The effort I put during the Grant challenge and commitment
16/08/23, 10:22 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 408 6291: Yes
16/08/23, 10:24 am - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride.

With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

11/10/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate Wednesdays through EWYL Group. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
11/10/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 Week 1: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM

 Week 2: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 Week 3: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 Week 4: Call on Saturday

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

08/11/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
08/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 70272 82381: Okay I wanted to ask if it is possible for someone who has only completed ordinary level to get this scholarship?
08/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, they are eligible for the Diploma courses. However, I am asking about the questions you can ask for checking if the student is eligible or not. Similar to the sample questions under the International Student Admission Eligibility Check
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 70272 82381: I have understood everything on the International Student Admission Eligibility check so I don't have any questions
08/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.
08/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you read those sample questions?
08/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes
08/11/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share such questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 3:53 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes ma'am thank you very much
08/11/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 3:57 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes, noted ma'am thank you
08/11/23, 3:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes ma'am I understand, thank you very much
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.

08/11/23, 4:19 pm - +91 70272 82381: The Edoofa Scholarship program offers a $300 plan training for Indian Edoofians to enhance their performance and skills in project opportunities. The program focuses on building a community of students and enhancing their presentation skills. The program requires students to reach out to potential applicants, inform them about the scholarship, and answer questions about the scholarship. The CAT (Community Assessment Test) is used to evaluate the application. Only Edoofa Certified Student Leaders will be accepted into the scholarship program. The program aims to provide students with the necessary resources and skills to excel in their projects.
I have to use various channels such as Facebook, Whatspp and Instagram in order to get potential applications . It is crucial for me to provide clear information about the Edoofa scholarship program. I have to also share my experience with the applicants so that the application process accessible and well informed for all interested students.
08/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as a Edoofa Certified Student Leader I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 4:20 pm - +91 70272 82381: Thank you ma'am
08/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your *Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity*. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me remind you about these two:

*Wednesday Wisdom* - Every Wednesday, you will receive a detailed lesson on a specific skill of the week. It follows a well-structured curriculum that promotes skill-based learning and enhances creativity among learners. To unlock the full potential of your learning journey, remember that it's not just about reading the lessons; it's about embarking on a quest where completing the tasks is your treasure map. Each task is a key that unlocks a new realm of knowledge and skills. So, don't just be a reader; be an achiever, a taskmaster who harnesses the true power of education.

*Saturday Activities* - In addition to excelling in academics, students need to acquire skills that will help them enhance the physical, artistic, and emotional aspects of their lives and succeed in this competitive world. Therefore, it is important to apply and revise what you learn in the Wednesday lesson. The Saturday activities motivate students to do the same.

08/11/23, 4:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 9:43 am - +91 70272 82381: Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a significant and joyful celebration in Indian culture, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. The festival transcends regional, religious, and linguistic barriers, and is celebrated by millions worldwide. It is associated with the worship of Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and the dismissal of ignorance. Diwali serves as a tribute to India's cultural diversity, with each region having its own unique way of celebrating it. In North India, it marks Lord Rama's return with grand processions and elaborate fireworks displays. In South India, it is dedicated to Lord Krishna and his defeat of the demon Narakasura. In the western state of Gujarat, Diwali is intertwined with the colorful and energetic dance form known as Garba. Diwali imparts several valuable lessons that resonate deeply with the human spirit, such as the importance of inner illumination, gratitude, generosity, and family and community bonds. In conclusion, Diwali stands as an invitation to the profound wisdom embedded in Indian culture, exemplifying the values of righteousness, knowledge, gratitude, and unity.
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

27/11/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes ma'am I am very curious to know more about it
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes I remember
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 70272 82381: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 70272 82381: The guidelines that I recall were attending the sessions on line, following instructions, sending at least 1 applicant form during the session

27/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.

27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - +91 70272 82381: Tell me more ma'am
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.

27/11/23, 3:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Luyanda before moving ahead I want to understand why didn't you attend any of the webinars?
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 70272 82381: My phone couldn't join the webinars because of the meet app that I was using so deleted it and downloaded a new one
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Luyanda, you could have attended the webinar from someone else's phone as well.
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 70272 82381: I didn't know that it's allowed until Mr Mukund told me that I can attend with someone
27/11/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:12 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes ma'am l believe
27/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - +91 70272 82381: Impressive
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - +91 70272 82381: Okay ma'am
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I hope you must have realized, that the only thing required here is your engagement with me. Is it that difficult?
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - +91 70272 82381: No it's not difficult
27/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Do you know why I shared this with you? Because I want you to think of the long-term picture, you might be in a position to use these credits for the coming term, but what about next year, next to next year?
27/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 70272 82381: I believe that from now I won't miss any so that next year I will be eligible for the Grant
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes ma'am I promise to do the best in this coming month
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 70272 82381: Noted
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.

I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 70272 82381: If I engage with you ma'am I believe that l can achieve it
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 70272 82381: Noted with thanks ma'am
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 4:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As of now, I am concluding our discussion, and I am hoping for a powerful December where we will work hard and make your parents proud.🤝🏽🏆
27/11/23, 4:03 pm - +91 70272 82381: Yes ma'am we will make them proud

29/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 70272 82381: Understanding the art of analysis is crucial in the fast-paced world of academia and beyond. It involve bbs breaking down tasks into their fundamental components, identifying key inputs, and crafting a processing plan. Analyzing the inputs allows you to assess what you already have and what you need to acquire. Crafting a thoughtful process ensures efficiency and effectiveness in achieving the desired output. Output evaluation is essential, as it allows you to identify areas of strength and weakness in your approach. Learning from mistakes is also important, as it allows you to refine your approach in the future. Analyzing inputs and output extends beyond the classroom, as employers value individuals who can assess situations, make informed decisions, and adapt their approaches based on feedback. Remember that the ability to analyze is not just a skill; it's a mindset that propels success in every endeavor.

13/12/23, 1:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. You have become eligible for the grant as of November and it is something really big, however, I want to ask you what extraordinary you wish to do for December to sustain where you are and achieve something even bigger?
2. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that and it is the primary goal that I have for you. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
3. I sincerely think we both are a great team and I want to know the key areas that you have identified for yourself after reflecting on your performance until now, where you need more assistance from my end?
13/12/23, 2:27 pm - +91 70272 82381: Thank you
13/12/23, 2:35 pm - +91 70272 82381: 1. In the month of December I don't want to miss any session or webinar. I want to attend every session in order to improve in my skills and to gain more knowledge
2. My target is 10 forms or more in December because amongst those ,not all will enroll so I need to have more students
3. On how I can get as many students so that I can find my university fees
13/12/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have asked about how can you get the maximum number of students, let me help you with that!
13/12/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I assume you already know that every school class has an informal WhatsApp group.

You can request to be added to the group and share information. Additionally, you can share the group's WhatsApp link and invite others who might be interested in joining. You can also add me to the group, and I can assist you in engaging the students.
