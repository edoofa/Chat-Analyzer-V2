Hope that you are well.

I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling upset about it. In situations like this, here's what you can do
If this is happening in a school like LPU, contact school authorities or administrators who can address the situation. Share the evidence with them.
Be cautious about what you share online. Review your privacy settings and consider limiting the information you post publicly. Only accept friend requests or connections from people you know in real life.
 It can be frustrating, but avoid engaging in arguments or responding to the hurtful comments. Responding may escalate the situation.

Also, I am trying my best to help you out with this as I am in conversation with the DSW Department regarding the same and we are trying our best to resolve this as you know this is something unofficial and out of the hands of authorities, but you do not worry and reach out to me if anything comes up.
26/09/23, 8:40 am - +91 89689 32089: Okay thank you
26/09/23, 8:40 am - +91 89689 32089: i will try to avoid it
26/09/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, and don't worry DSW Department Head Mr. Rithvik would be looking into it.
26/09/23, 9:27 am - +91 89689 32089: Okay thank you
26/09/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
26/09/23, 3:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @918968932089 I am trying to connect with you for the scheduled call.
27/09/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝
