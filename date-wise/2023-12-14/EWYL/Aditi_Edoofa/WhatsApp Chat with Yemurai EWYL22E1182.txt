I hope that you are well.

Please excuse me for being unable to take your session today as I went to the airport to receive our Proud Edoofians. I am indeed overjoyed to have the privilege of mentoring such exceptional students. Witnessing their joyful and enthusiastic expressions after their lengthy journey was a truly heartwarming experience.❤️
08/08/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Yemurai
Hope that you are doing well.

Let's begin with our today's discussions🚀
08/08/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 409 0314: Good morning Ms Kapoor, I am Yemurai's mother. The last time Yemurai's lessons were put on hold we anticipated that during their school holiday she would have time to proceed but however there are vacation lessons which began at their school starting yesterday 7 Aug - 31 Aug. I don't know how best we can proceed given the situation she is in.
08/08/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 475 5539: Morning ma'am 
Sorry I am let for the session
08/08/23, 4:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings of the day ma'am
Hope that you are well.
08/08/23, 4:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know her timings of the lessons? <This message was edited>

Hope that you are well.
10/08/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Can I please have a response on this I am looking forward to continuing Yemurai's EWYL journey.

10/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 409 0314: Her lessons starts at 7:45am and ends at 5pm.
10/08/23, 10:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am well
Thanks for asking.
10/08/23, 10:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Since you have mentioned the concern regarding the issue of attending sessions due to Yemurai's lessons I understand your concern regarding this and I want to assure you that this will not hinder her path toward reaching her goals since she has a genuine issue, we can put her sessions _on hold_ for some time. And after that, I have *planned a few milestones* that I and Yemurai need to achieve, I truly believe that she has great potential and want her to focus on her ultimate goals, so I am looking forward to this journey as I promised it would be an *earning and learning* opportunity and I want that she doesn't face any loss so, I ll be planning according to her schedule after she finishes her lessons.

I hope that we are on the same page on this?
10/08/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you so much for the consideration, I am now relieved.
10/08/23, 1:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.

08/09/23, 2:55 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
16/09/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Yemurai!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 409 0314: Greetings to you all. We are all doing well. Thank you very much for being so considerate. Since Yemurai is tidy up with her exams I would suggest that we proceed with the 1st option where I would complete the sessions for her. I would go for Monday, Tuesday  and Wednesday:  2:00 pm to 3:00pm.
16/09/23, 10:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, this is great!
16/09/23, 10:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: I appreciate you for being such considerate parents.
16/09/23, 10:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you and have a good day!
16/09/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 409 0314: Most welcome. Good day too.
19/09/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

So, are you ready for today's session?
19/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Greetings too. Am well, thanks and you. Yes am ready
19/09/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
19/09/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work uopn three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Yemurai will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
19/09/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Fine, let me go through it will get back to you shortly
19/09/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, after you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it. <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Noted.
19/09/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, I'll be waiting for your resposne!
19/09/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time and would like you to be more active.
19/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Good afternoon.  My sincere apology for responding late.   After going through the document, I learned that the main purpose of the EWYL program is  to create awareness to learners on how future jobs look like and  help them acquire skills required  to perform these jobs.  This awareness is raised through updating learners on current trends that may have a positive or negative impact on learners. This may help learners to adapt to changes so that they do not become irrelevant. There are some skills that are to be a requirement in the old days but due to technological changes the skills became redundant and new ones are emerging. We are now living in a world where technology is revolving, and all businesses are now relying on social media. So learners should have the ability to realize the right range of data by analyzing whether it's useful for their career goals. Learners should also be able to be creative and  connect virtually with other team members globally as they work towards their career. I have also learned that the projects that learners should do help them to become employable at the same time, earning scholarship credits, which will lower their expenses and enhance their family savings. After going through this journey, learners should directly impact their societies and the economy positively as well as inspire their juniors to follow the same route. Last but not least, it will help  spread the message of Edoofa and benefit more youths. 

Thank you.
19/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you, once again.
20/09/23, 8:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
20/09/23, 8:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: You are absolutely correct, we will connect on this in our session.
20/09/23, 8:25 am - +263 77 409 0314: Am doing well, thank you.
20/09/23, 8:25 am - +263 77 409 0314: Well noted.
20/09/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, are you ready to start our session? <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes, I am ready.
20/09/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
20/09/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Yemurai can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page? <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Well understood. Yes, we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Yemurai is back, she is supposed to note a few things.
FIRST- To choose a batch for her sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Noted. I will give her an update.
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You may choose a batch on her behalf.
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Tuesday and Friday
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days chosen), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Ok, that is fine.
20/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 409 0314: So does it mean that it will be in another group, not this one.
20/09/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is basically a personal chat for regular sessions and only important discussions take place on the EWYL Group.
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Ok
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is the EWYL LINE.
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Received with thanks.
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yemurai's session will on Tuesday and Friday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In the session, she is  required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Well noted that her sessions will be on Tuesday and Friday. Kindly advise when she is supposed to start. Currently, it may be difficult for her since they are starting their final examinations next month. They are not allowed to have cellphones at school. Hope you have scheduled her to start after her exams. Which I am sure after her exams she will dedicate 100% of her time towards this.
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, I have scheduled it for next month.
20/09/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Yemurai has crossed in the complete journey of her being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
20/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Noted.
20/09/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

21/09/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
21/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Afternoon, yes am ready.
21/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 409 0314: I am very well, thank you for asking
21/09/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where Yemurai learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, she was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
21/09/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help Yemurai to fund her higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help to build her personality along with a diversified skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
21/09/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
21/09/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
21/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Yes sure.
21/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 409 0314: This is well noted.
21/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Definitely .
21/09/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Yemurai's involvement in the EWYL program can bring her closer to reaching her career goals.
21/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 409 0314: T
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you very much I really  appreciate your dedication

21/09/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!

17/10/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 409 0314: Greetings to you too.We are doing very well. Thank you for checking on us. All is well with Yemurai. She has started her exams and the feedback I am getting  from her is very positive, and I am looking forward that she completes all her exams  with that positive attitude.
17/10/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 409 0314: Thank you, we will definitely go through it.
17/10/23, 1:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you're all doing well. It's great to know that Yemurai has started her exams on a positive note. Maintaining a positive outlook is a significant factor in achieving success
17/10/23, 1:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Do share your thoughts about it with me.
17/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 409 0314: First and foremost, I would like to appreciate the generosity that you showed by starting this important and beneficiary program.  You make students realise their full potential and see their dreams coming true. I was really inspired by the 3rd quote; “Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago”.  For sure our children are benefiting from this program because of the vision that you had. This is most appreciated.  
Yes, I do support Henry Ford’s belief that providing value before seeking value is a wise approach. By so doing there is mutual respect which will be created between the provider and receiver.  Customers will maintain that relationship and value it. The outcomes I envision experiencing if I apply this principle in life is maintaining 100% customer satisfaction and well as retention of same. When customers choose any company, they have some expectations from it so fulfilling those expectation will create a good brand name for myself.  Nowadays there is stiffer competition and there is need to go an extra mile in order to maintain that value.
Thank you.

Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
06/12/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263784755539 Can you enlighten me on the reason for your absence from the session?
06/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 475 5539: Sorry ma'am for being this late 
I was having trouble connecting
06/12/23, 4:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yemurai, please make sure that you are on time and look for various other ways but be regular in your sessions.
06/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 475 5539: Noted. Ma'am
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*YEMURAI/ADITI*
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
07/12/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 475 5539: Noted ma'am 
Let me create the group

07/12/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
07/12/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

07/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
07/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
07/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
07/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
