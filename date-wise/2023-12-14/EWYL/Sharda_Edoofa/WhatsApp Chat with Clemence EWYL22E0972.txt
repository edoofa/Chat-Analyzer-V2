Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

30/09/23, 9:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening, Clemence!
I trust you're doing well

Our conversation on call was truly enjoyable, and I'd like to kindly remind you of the three tasks you need to complete:

📍 Please ask your *parents to confirm in this group that you've discussed the $300 plan with them*.
📍 *Share a screenshot* of the *Google review* you write for Edoofa.
📍 *share a screenshot* of the *Facebook review* you write for Edoofa.
03/10/23, 8:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
03/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 362 2826: Maam
03/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 362 2826: How are you
03/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 362 2826: I saw you message and i didnt ignor it.. due to pressure on CA and Mid term tests.. things are very tight .. and i am failing to manage time…  Google reviews i did it long back the day you told me to do.. so i will check my coment and screen shot it on both facebook and Instagram
03/10/23, 8:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since you have completed the google review that day. Kindly finish the Facebook review as well.
It will not take more than 5 minutes.
03/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 362 2826: I do facebook  as well let me go there now and take screenshots
03/10/23, 8:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Coming to your CA and mid terms, I completely understand the pressure. All you have to do is manage your time wisely and revise everything you have learnt.
03/10/23, 8:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You will definitely do great.
03/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 362 2826: I am failing😸😸  but  i will do my best to balance all projects and school
03/10/23, 8:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I know you will.
May I know what is the exact challenge?
03/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 362 2826: Timing.. many lectures and assignments
03/10/23, 8:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes that must be a concern.
I would suggest you to pay attention to your lectures during lecture time and then pay attention on assignments while doing the assignments.
If you will focus on one thing at a time and manage time wisely.
You will definitely be able to succed.
03/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 362 2826: Some they teach in Hindi 🤧🤧🤧 haaaaa

This is indeed a concern. I would want you to either ask your teachers to teach in english and if they do not listn then inform Mr. Rithvik or Mr. Mukund regarding the same.
10/10/23, 3:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

10/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 362 2826: Oka mamm thanks
