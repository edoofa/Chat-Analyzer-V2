2)Hello Friends
I am Hazel Tadiwanashe Manjoro a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

22/08/23, 9:14 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:
22/08/23, 9:14 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
22/08/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:
22/08/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
22/08/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
22/08/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Are you following*?
22/08/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 642 8486: It'd a great idea Ms Sharda
22/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 642 8486: Yes ,I agree
22/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 642 8486: Noted
22/08/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
22/08/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
22/08/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],

22/08/23, 9:30 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great Hazel!
23/08/23, 8:28 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello, Curious Mind!
I hope you are doing well

Your eagerness to learn is infectious, and I'm excited to explore new concepts and ideas with you

Let's make this session a place where questions lead to discoveries!
Are you ready for it?
23/08/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 642 8486: Morning , I'm ready Ms Sharda
23/08/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: How are you?
23/08/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: School Group < 100
23/08/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 642 8486: I'm good thank you for asking.
23/08/23, 8:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: School Group < 100
23/08/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

or

2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
23/08/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: How to excel in the project?
23/08/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: SET 1:
23/08/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since you are facing challenges connecting with Headmasters, what we can do is:
23/08/23, 8:49 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1) I can share some contact details with you of those Schools that were earlier not responsive to us with whom you can establish a connection again

2) You can try searching for schools on Google
-Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results. 
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.

3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.

4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
23/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 642 8486: Brilliant idea
23/08/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: SET 2
23/08/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
  ▪️With consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success 
  ▪️Visiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
  ▪️With this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
23/08/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
23/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 642 8486: Oky
23/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
23/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.
23/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.
23/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
23/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: So, Hazel, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
23/08/23, 9:23 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits

2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency

3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
23/08/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 642 8486: Noted Ms Sharda
23/08/23, 9:28 am - Sharda Edoofa: So Hazel, There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me

24/08/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: ADMISSION TEAM AND EWYL DIFFERENCE
24/08/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
24/08/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 


During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
24/08/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
24/08/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
24/08/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
24/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 642 8486: Oky Ms Sharda
24/08/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
24/08/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.

There is no order in which you have to do the project.

There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.

There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.

It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*

Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
24/08/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 642 8486: Yes ,we are on the same page
24/08/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 642 8486: Noted with Thank Ms Sharda

The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."

Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.

For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.
