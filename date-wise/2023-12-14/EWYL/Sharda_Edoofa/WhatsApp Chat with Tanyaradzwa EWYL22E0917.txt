11/01/23, 1:43 pm - You were added
03/08/23, 11:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings and a lovely morning to you my dear student!
03/08/23, 12:18 pm - +263 71 846 8319: Good afternoon
04/08/23, 12:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon *Tanyaradzwa*!

Please excuse me for the delay in my response. As many Edoofians are arriving in India, i got busy with the preparations going at the backend.
04/08/23, 12:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I understand that your EWYL program has been put on hold. 
Can you kindly let me know *the reason* for the same?

I would appreciate it if you could share *when you* will you be able to resume our sessions?
 
I'm truly looking forward to *embarking* on this journey together, and your presence is *eagerly* anticipated.
04/08/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 846 8319: Afternoon how are you doing
04/08/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 846 8319: The schedule of my EWYL program was clashing with my school time table
05/08/23, 12:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in reply. By the time you texted, i got busy in an urgent meeting.
05/08/23, 12:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you?
05/08/23, 12:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, thank you so much for informing.
15/09/23, 9:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tanyaradzwa

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 7:00 am - +243 842 242 746: Hi morning hope you are well 
Option 1 the best time would be 2 to 3 pm
16/09/23, 10:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. Thank you so much for confirming.
16/09/23, 11:09 am - +243 842 242 746: Welcome have a good day
17/09/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 846 8319 changed to +263 71 484 8242
21/09/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon 

Hope you are doing well!

It's a pleasure to have you join me for this scheduled session
Are you ready for an enriching learning experience ?
21/09/23, 2:34 pm - +243 842 242 746: Hi we are well thank you
21/09/23, 2:35 pm - +243 842 242 746: Hope you are fine also
21/09/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes I am doing great.
Are you ready for the session?
21/09/23, 2:36 pm - +243 842 242 746: Yes we can proceed
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: - Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/09/23, 9:35 am - +243 842 242 746: Hi good morning
22/09/23, 9:35 am - +243 842 242 746: Pls assist with the two key objectives
22/09/23, 9:36 am - +243 842 242 746: Information
22/09/23, 9:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning 
I hope you are doing well
22/09/23, 9:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: yes sure
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Tanyaradzwa* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/09/23, 9:51 am - +243 842 242 746: I am ok thank you
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
22/09/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me know once you are done?
22/09/23, 9:53 am - +243 842 242 746: Well appreciated
22/09/23, 9:55 am - +243 842 242 746: This is so encouraging and wonderful
22/09/23, 9:56 am - +243 842 242 746: 🙏🏽🙏🏽
22/09/23, 9:57 am - +243 842 242 746: Thank you for the introductions
22/09/23, 10:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes it is
22/09/23, 10:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome
22/09/23, 10:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Tanyaradzwa* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/09/23, 10:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Tanyaradzwa* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
22/09/23, 10:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 10:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: -At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Tanyaradzwa’S EWYL journey:
22/09/23, 10:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Tanyaradzwa* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
22/09/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 484 8242: Good morning

29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Tanyaradzwa* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
29/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 484 8242: Understood
29/09/23, 2:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

I trust you are in good health.

I understand that *Tanyaradzwa* is currently occupied with ongoing exams, and I want to ensure my student doesn't miss out on any valuable learning opportunities. Therefore, I'd like to share today's weekly newsletter, which you can review at your convenience.
19/10/23, 9:14 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day, Tanyaradzwa and parents! @263775808554 @263714848242 @243842242746 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

26/10/23, 4:01 pm - +243 842 242 746: She wants to know if it possible to change  the degree program she had selected
26/10/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since this is an admission related query, I would really appreciate it if you consult your admission group and admission officers regarding this.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

22/11/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done
22/11/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
22/11/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
22/11/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/11/23, 10:06 am - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please.
23/11/23, 8:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Tanyaradzwa*
I hope you are doing well

You have a session scheduled today at *8:30 am*. Kindly confirm your availability for the same.
23/11/23, 8:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now that it is our session time, are you ready for it?
23/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 484 8242: Yes
23/11/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!
23/11/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
23/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 484 8242: Yes
23/11/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
23/11/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.

Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
23/11/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Tanyaradzwa*, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
23/11/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will definitely help you out.
