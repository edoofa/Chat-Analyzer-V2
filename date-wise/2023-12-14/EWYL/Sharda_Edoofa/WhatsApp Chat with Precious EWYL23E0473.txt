29/08/23, 4:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

05/09/23, 6:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.

05/09/23, 6:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:

12/09/23, 8:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Your welcome please!
15/09/23, 9:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Precious

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 5:27 am - +263 77 325 2317: Good morning, thanks for  your understanding, l as the guardian of Precious l will step in where l can.
16/09/23, 10:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning !

16/09/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 325 2317: The Mon to Wednesday session of 8:30am to 9:30am
16/09/23, 1:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay noted, thank you.
19/09/23, 8:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Tuesday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
19/09/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 325 2317: Morning, sorry for the delay l am kind of busy right now but will try to respond
20/09/23, 5:34 am - +263 77 325 2317: Good morning, l am free today, so if you are free as well, we can start today but network still remains a big challenge.
20/09/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning, Esteemed Learner!
How are you?

It's an honor to have such dedicated students join me for this scheduled session

Let's delve into our subject matter with enthusiasm and curiosity
Are you ready for it?
20/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 325 2317: Good morning, it's Draper, guardian of Precious,.l am standing in for her since she at boarding school right now and about to sit for her examinations
20/09/23, 8:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind gesture.
20/09/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 9:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
-
20/09/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 325 2317: Can you please enlight me on the objective l haven't had time to read through as l am at work most of the time
20/09/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Precious is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
20/09/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
20/09/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
20/09/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 325 2317: Sreenshot not yet in, From the explanation you gave l fully understand
20/09/23, 9:14 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay I am sending it
20/09/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 9:17 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 9:17 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 9:18 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
20/09/23, 9:18 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
20/09/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 325 2317: Acknowledged. Hello Ms Sanjana
20/09/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 325 2317: This is wonderful, l pray my Precious does the same
20/09/23, 9:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes she wil definitely shine bright!
20/09/23, 9:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 9:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/09/23, 9:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Precious* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.

*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 325 2317: Very interesting but Precious won't be available for the session she is required to be in, because the boarding does not allow pupils to have phones at all, if you are caught with one, it's confiscated only to be returned on when school close. Is it possible that you run a crash program when she returns home that's 18 November
20/09/23, 10:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, it is very much possible and I have anyway planned to do so for her so that she does not miss on any laerning opportunity.
20/09/23, 10:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Precious* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
20/09/23, 10:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 10:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Precious’s  EWYL journey:
20/09/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 325 2317: I have read the newsletter and it's quite interesting and very educative at the same time
20/09/23, 2:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am happy to know liked reading the newsletter. Your feedback is importnat.
21/09/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning

2. Ensure NAME is given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
21/09/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Precious will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

26/09/23, 9:16 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Precious* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
26/09/23, 9:16 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Precious* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
26/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 325 2317: I am through, thank you.

I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

That's wonderful to hear that Precious has interests in both music and sports! Music and sports can offer a great balance of physical and creative activities. Is there a particular instrument or style of music that Precious enjoys playing or listening to? 

When it comes to sports, does she have a favorite sport or a specific team she supports? It's always exciting to see how children's interests develop and how they can be nurtured.
01/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 325 2317: I am fine and how are you, l had a hectic day.

To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.'

The main goals for this projects are to develop certain skills in edoofians.

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not

24/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
24/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

24/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

06/12/23, 8:24 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Precious
I hope you are doing well

I understand that you're facing a situation where some of the friends you invited to join the Edoofa group are leaving. It's natural to feel concerned about this, but let's approach it in a practical and logical manner.
06/12/23, 8:24 am - Sharda Edoofa: Firstly, it's essential to recognize that people have various commitments and priorities. Students may leave the group for reasons beyond your control, such as personal schedules, academic workload, or other engagements. Instead of seeing it as a setback, consider it as part of the normal ebb and flow of group dynamics.
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Precious
*Let's kick things off with a motivational quote from the legendary Warren Buffett:*
*"The best investment you can make is in yourself."*

This quote underscores the profound importance of self-development and personal growth. Buffett emphasizes that the most valuable asset you possess is yourself. By investing time, effort, and resources in your education, skills, and well-being, you lay the foundation for future success.

So, let's use today's session as an opportunity to explore how we can invest in ourselves, hone our skills, and empower each other on the journey towards success. Remember, the dividends of self-investment are boundless!
06/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 589 5789: Okay...thank you for keeping me motivated
06/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 589 5789: Good afternoon...
06/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.*

06/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 589 5789: Okay ma'am
07/12/23, 1:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Precious

As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:

Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room
Now, what does this mean to you?
Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.

So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.

Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
07/12/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.* 
I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today without any prior notice. I trust that you recognize the importance of these sessions and the necessity of maintaining regular attendance.
I would also like to understand the reason behind your absence.

08/12/23, 1:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Precious
As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"
Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
08/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 589 5789: Good afternoon
08/12/23, 1:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.
For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.
So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.

"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." - Helen Keller
This powerful quote by Helen Keller encapsulates the essence of collaboration and collective effort. It reminds us that our individual abilities may be limited, but when we unite and work together, our potential becomes boundless. Today, let's embrace the strength that lies in our unity and forge ahead towards shared success.
