15/09/23, 8:14 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, before we move forward, I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?

15/09/23, 8:20 am - +263 77 324 9002: I'm Kimberly Taboka Chakoreka from Victoria Falls Zimbabwe. I'm 19 years old. I'm the first born and l live with my mother and my two siblings. I finished my O'level  in 2020 where l managed to come out with 12 out of 12 subjects.

15/09/23, 8:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.

15/09/23, 8:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Ma'am
It's a pleasure to connect with you and I am sure that we will get to know each other better during this journey.
15/09/23, 8:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/09/23, 8:27 am - +263 77 324 9002: Thank you
15/09/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 324 9002: Not really, l don't think lm quite aware of these two objectives ma'am.
15/09/23, 8:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding
15/09/23, 8:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/09/23, 8:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/09/23, 8:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: Have you understood it now?
15/09/23, 8:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
15/09/23, 8:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
15/09/23, 8:32 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts
15/09/23, 8:32 am - +263 77 324 9002: Yes l've understood thank you
15/09/23, 8:32 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, Noted.
15/09/23, 8:32 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
15/09/23, 8:32 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!

15/09/23, 9:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: There is particular deadline to it. You can do it whenever.
15/09/23, 9:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: so very quickly  summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
15/09/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 324 9002: Corporate alliance has to do with helping you have an understanding of the market that lies along with the career path you have chosen and helps you prepare early for it. The task is to identify technologically driven companies within my region. One has to connect with family and friends from that sector and share with them how Edoofa is helping you develop necessary skills for future employment.

Here is the message -
15/09/23, 10:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!
15/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 372 7884: so for this form once I've shred it with my friends,, should they fill it in and bring it back to you or what?

Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
15/09/23, 11:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:
15/09/23, 11:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa.

well noted
15/09/23, 11:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
15/09/23, 11:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
15/09/23, 11:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
