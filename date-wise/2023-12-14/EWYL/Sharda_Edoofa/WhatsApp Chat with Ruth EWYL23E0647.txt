1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
09/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 886 1991: im following
09/10/23, 1:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

11/10/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/10/23, 8:38 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
12/10/23, 8:38 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
12/10/23, 8:38 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

16/10/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 886 1991: my previous school being University of Zimbabwe
16/10/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Ruth great!
16/10/23, 8:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: If any *School is not connected* with Edoofa:
16/10/23, 8:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?

16/10/23, 8:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/10/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 886 1991: yess its good for more students to have opportunities to study abroad
16/10/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
16/10/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 886 1991: are we already working on this project??
16/10/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: This is the messages that you can send to the authorities when you will start working on this project.
16/10/23, 9:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: And yes, we can start working on this project as soon as possible.
16/10/23, 9:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/10/23, 9:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
16/10/23, 9:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.

I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs.

16/10/23, 9:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Is everything clear until now, Ruth?*
16/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 886 1991: yess its clear
16/10/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

16/10/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 886 1991: yess I am
16/10/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
16/10/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

In order to opt out of the program there is a formal procedure that one has to follow. Through this you have to ask your parents to send an email to us regarding you opting out of the program.

Also, doing the EWYL program has its own perks. It is one of a kind program.

11/12/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!
