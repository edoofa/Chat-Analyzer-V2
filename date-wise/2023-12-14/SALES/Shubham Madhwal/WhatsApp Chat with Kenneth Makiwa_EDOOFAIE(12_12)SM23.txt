Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

c. EWLY program is to prepare students to be job-ready, learn and pick job skills through working experience on live projects. It also help students to earn scholarship credits to further reduce their school fees. EWYL help build technical skills like digital marketing, organization, management and soft skills. Ot also help students get online opportunities to learn employability skills

d. I believe to be accepted in Edoofa scholarship program because i believe l am a hardworking young man capable of f learning and develop new skills. I gave i strong academic record. I came up with 10 subjects, 5 As and 5 Bs, at my o level. I finished my a level this year with good course work standards. I had 3 As in my Pure Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry combination. Final Zimsec results are pending. My financial background is limiting me from achieving my goals and reach my potential. I am a quick learner and i can quickly adapt to my extracurricular activities.

Zimbabwe is reach in lithium and plenty of iron ores but it is still importing lithium batteries and steel
