We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

23/11/23, 10:25 am - +27 73 055 2749: Yes
23/11/23, 10:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
23/11/23, 10:44 am - +27 73 055 2749: Yes I am

23/11/23, 1:50 pm - +27 73 055 2749: The reason for me to desire to study abroad and not in my native country  is because Studying abroad provides you with a  unique opportunity to fulfill your dreams ,This itself is a hugely rewarding experience on top of getting a degree. Getting to experience more of the world will shape your character and worldview, and prepare you for a more globalized society.And more of the students  which are studying abroad their dream comes true whilst who are left in the our country they are failing sometimes due to the shortage of resources and  lectures e.t.c
23/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
23/11/23, 2:33 pm - +27 73 055 2749: I never did it before
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
23/11/23, 5:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
23/11/23, 6:05 pm - +27 67 361 6520: We are experiencing load shedding that's our problem here
23/11/23, 6:16 pm - +27 73 055 2749: I'm not aware about the cost
23/11/23, 6:18 pm - +27 73 055 2749: We are experiencing load shedding
24/11/23, 11:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Kudzai and Ms Sihle @27730552749 @27673616520, How are you?
24/11/23, 11:51 am - +27 73 055 2749: We are fine
24/11/23, 11:54 am - +27 67 361 6520: We are fine

24/11/23, 12:18 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Yes I am
24/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
24/11/23, 1:26 pm - +27 73 055 2749: No I don't have
24/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
24/11/23, 2:31 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Oky I didn't know
24/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
24/11/23, 3:01 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Oky understood and it's interesting
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Ooooh oky I understand
24/11/23, 7:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

29/11/23, 1:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program
29/11/23, 1:09 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Yes u can
29/11/23, 1:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted
29/11/23, 1:24 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Oky
29/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
29/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
29/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/11/23, 1:27 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Understood 👏
29/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
* How to network like a boss - by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

29/11/23, 2:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/11/23, 2:37 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Yes I think it might benefit me to a larger extent

29/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
29/11/23, 3:00 pm - +27 73 055 2749: It is,,,,so when do I start doing these projects
29/11/23, 3:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 3:56 pm - +27 73 055 2749: These are steps that u go through wen u are Appling for Edoofa scholarship
29/11/23, 4:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
29/11/23, 4:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 4:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/11/23, 4:18 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Oky
29/11/23, 4:18 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Oky understood <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
29/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth. 


2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off


3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.

4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
29/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
29/11/23, 4:38 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Affordability through guaranteed scholarships  because through the acceptance of this program  a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100 percent of their tuition fee,,,this makes me to save bigger amounts in the application
29/11/23, 4:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?

29/11/23, 5:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

02/12/23, 3:44 pm - +27 73 055 2749: Rwanda - life after the genocide

04/06/2015April 6, 2015
On April 7, 1994, the genocide directed against Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus began. 21 years on, Rwandans have made considerable progress on the road to reconciliation and are focusing on economic development.




"I saw people set houses on fire and commit murders – it is very difficult to get these images out of my head," D'Artagnan Habintwali said. He was only five years old when the killing began in his native city of Butare, in the south of Rwanda. Now a student, images of the violence still haunt him. Between April and July 1994, the land of a thousand hills was the scene of massacres, as the government carried out a planned campaign to kill the Tutsi minority. The Hutu majority was encouraged to kill the "inyenzi," the "cockroaches." The slaughter unfolded in front of the eyes of a paralyzed international community. The United Nations estimates that about 800,000 people lost their lives.



In the last decades Rwandans have come a long way on the arduous road to reconciliation. One of the first things the new government did was to eliminate the reference to ethnicity in identification documents. From then on, the country's inhabitants were all "Rwandans."

The practice of doing regular community work, which was grounded in the Rwandan tradition of "umuganda," was reintroduced not only as part of the effort to rebuild the country but as a way to foster a community spirit. Once a month, Rwandans are called upon to perform communal tasks such as building a house for the needy, laying a road or sweeping a square.

The legal process of investigating the genocide and restoring justice proved to be one of the most difficult aspects that had to be dealt with. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was set up immediately in 1994 in Arusha, Tanzania, in order to prosecute those mainly responsible for the genocide. A total of 65 people were tried at the ICTR; 38 were convicted and sentenced to long jail terms.

A building housing the 
On a national level, traditional community courts called "gacaca" were revived in 2001. Between 2005 and 2012 these courts tried almost two million people across the country. International human rights organizations were concerned because the courts hardly met international legal standards, something they said had led to judicial errors.

"Gacacas were there for people to tell the truth, but also to give people the time and a forum in which to talk to each other," said Jean Damascene Gasanabo, a senior official of the National Commission for the Fight Against Genocide (CNLG). "You can't just tell your neighbor it's time to reconcile; we had to initiate this process."

Achieving reconciliation

In Simbi, a village in the south, not far from the border to Burundi, more than 5,000 people fell victim to the genocide. Today the community lives together in peace again. A local nongovernmental organization called "Association Modeste et Innocent" or AMI, as in the French word for friend, had promoted reconciliation.


Jean-Pierre Karenzi was involved in the genocide. He spent many years in jail for his crimes. Since his release in 2005 he has been working for the community in Simbi. Today he looks back on his past in shame. "I participated in the genocide, because the government at the time incited us to do so."

Jean-Baptiste Kanobayire also lives in Simbi. The 70-year-old survivor was one of the first to take part in AMI's courses. He suffered a great deal. "But as time went by, I decided that life had to go on," he said. "We came together to join forces and work toward progress and unity."

For several years, the members of the community of Simbi have been organized in an agricultural cooperative called "Duharanire Ubumwe N'Ubwiyunge" – "Working Toward Unity and Reconciliation." Together, the members of the cooperative want to boost agricultural production – for them, a sign of development.

Promoting economic progress

The government in Kigali is also counting on economic progress to help the country achieve lasting reconciliation. A poverty reduction program, with measures such as the introduction of health insurance for all, the targeted improvement of educational opportunity as well as a promotion of the private sector had already yielded results, according to Daniela Beckmann, the head of Germany's state-owned development bank, KFW, in Kigali. Rwanda had reduced its poverty rate by 12 percent within 5 years. It now stood at 45%, Beckmann said, adding that in comparison to other African countries that was an extremely good result. But this did not mean there were no challenges ahead, she warned. After all, Rwanda needs foreign aid to meet half of its budgeted expenses.

Demanding a political opening

As one of the few representatives of a domestic political opposition, Frank Habineza, the chairman of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda (DGPR), criticizes the income gap, saying that Rwanda was the country with the greatest inequality in East Africa. "Our party is more focused on social justice so that we can distribute resources equitably," he said, "but we believe that for this to be sustainable or possible, it requires opening up more political space, having democracy take root in Rwanda so that people feel confident in investing their money - and even foreign investments come to Rwanda, when people feel that it is safe and the country will be safe for the next generation."



In the next presidential election in 2017, the young party wants to field a candidate to give the population an alternative to Paul Kagame. Since the genocide, the former rebel leader's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has had almost exclusive control over the country's destiny. The RPF won the last parliamentary elections in September 2013 with over two-thirds of the votes.

Focusing on the future

The capital, Kigali, has 1.2 million inhabitants. It is regarded as a symbol of Rwanda's progress. In the city center, one commercial skyscraper after the next is being built. Mayor Fidele Ndayisiba is convinced that "if the pace of development continues, in 10 years time Kigali will be a modern, flourishing city."


Even if the people beyond the city center still have to wait for modernity to arrive, Rwandans are patient and optimistic about the future. Today D'Artagnan Habintwali, the traumatized boy from Butare, is 25 years old. He has almost completed his studies and wants to become a writer. "There will come a time when everything will be alright," he says confidently.

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program former students of St. David's Bonda which also happens to be our associate school, they are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, she would be the right person to help you clarify how the Edoofa scholarship program has assisted her and how it was possible for her to cater towards international education for both her children at the same time. Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

11/12/23, 12:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: There are two options for the same, 

1) We have Mrs. Christine Rockson, the Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, Kempton Park Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa who has her child, Tadiwanashe Rockson studying in India under the Edoofa program!

She has been helping parents in South Africa to create Mama Money orders for the payment of enrollment fees. 

2) Otherwise, we will share the Mama Money order with you directly. You can visit nearby shops to pay the order

Please basically, Mama money is a cheaper mode of payment from South Africa through which you can pay in Rands at the nearby shops.
