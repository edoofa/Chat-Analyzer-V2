12/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 428 3726: What motivatated me to apply for Edoofa is that it is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees so i saw that i might i get a chance for the scholaship
12/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 428 3726: What i undarstand about Edoofa is that Over the past 6 years, it have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 3000 students from different countries. It received applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

The program was founded in 2019, and its mission is to help African students reach their full potential through access to education. Edoofa offers scholarships to students who demonstrate academic excellence, financial need, and a commitment to giving back to their communities. So far, the program has helped over 1,000 students from over 20 countries in Africa. I think this is a great program that's making a real difference in the lives of African students.
12/12/23, 11:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted Abishai, so did *Nyashadzashe* not share with you the questionnaire?
12/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 428 3726: The EWYL Projects that are assigned to the students are designed in a way students start preparing themselves for the actual jobs in the industry and guide them to be on the right path to becoming young professionals. 

Keeping in mind, the industrial requirements and to help them attain the skills I mentioned, the EWYL team has designed 3 projects for them which remain the same throughout their journey, and based on one dedication and performance, the students are assigned more projects. 

Once the students start with the EWYL Program, they would be allotted an EWYL Mentor who will guide them better. An EWYL Mentor's core responsibility is to guide his/her students on the projects allocated to them, ensure they are working hard and earning credits, and at the same time focus on the skills they will need in the industry.
12/12/23, 11:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted,  And what about the rest of 4 questions?

13/12/23, 6:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
13/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 428 3726: Good evening sir
13/12/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 428 3726: write to tell you about myself is that I am nothing but just a unique kind of ‘substance’ made up of hydrogen, carbon, , and oxygen, trying to leave a positive mark in the world. In the effort to do so, I have been continuously changing qualitatively. Being the first   child raised by my parents , I have had quite a rough childhood. Giving up on my aspirations and wishes was a normal part of my life. Living with limited luxuries  has a massive role in my personality today. I know how it is like not to have someone to hear you out when you come back home after a terrible day at school. Hence, I always try to be an ear to my friends and make them feel better.

However, I never let my financial constraints and not-so-easy family life get in the way of my academic goals. On the contrary, I have always been keen to learn new things and achieve good grades. As a result, I successfully managed to go to Alevel  . Getting into grade 12  was one of my  dreams as well as a major goal. Besides, it gave me a chance to make my parents proud and also be the highest level of my Education

2 If i would  get a chance to continue with my academics it would be a dream to study law ,

3 my mother is not employed and my father is a builder

4my father 's highest educational level is grade 11 or elevel  and my mother finished her academics at grade 7

5. my father has been trying to pay for my school fees since i was in grade 1

6 as a dream to continue with my higher education ,i dont who is going to.pay my higher educational level

7 yes i have a sibling  ,whom i called a brother and he  just finished his education and not yet employed

8 i do  my grade 12  at budiriro b college and it is located in gweru midlands and the amount i payed per term is $120 usd
