24/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 964 1414: R*
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 964 1414: That true
24/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 964 1414: Yah thanks l get it
24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Manhamo, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 964 1414: No
24/11/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Why are you saying so Manhamo?

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts in Geography*
24/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 964 1414: Ok it nyc tooo
24/11/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
24/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 964 1414: Yaaah l have the confident
25/11/23, 8:20 am - +263 78 204 5981: Good day ,thank you for giving me this opportunity to show case my interest regarding about the education of my son Tanaka Manhamo as well as the possibility of getting scholarship in India .I am very excited about it and supportive as a mother sory yesterday I was offline due to network issues where I am working in rural area .may you kindly go ahead with your assistance

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?

28/11/23, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Believe you can and you're halfway there."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
28/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 204 5981: Thank you today maybe my network is okay
28/11/23, 9:03 am - Gurvinder: Alright,let us continue the session.
28/11/23, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
28/11/23, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/11/23, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/11/23, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 204 5981: Sorry to take you back I think Tanaka should do  BA in Geography because it not limited
28/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 204 5981: Thank you let me check the cost
28/11/23, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: Yes Mrs.Tecla, after BA Geography, a lot of pathways will open for Manhamo.
28/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 204 5981: Thank you it's affordable
28/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 204 5981: Yes I this is the right degree
28/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 204 5981: May continue
28/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 964 1414: Connected
28/11/23, 9:19 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Mrs.Tecla what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 204 5981: That's great  Cary on with my son
28/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 964 1414: That's good
28/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 204 5981: I am prepared for that  I will manage
28/11/23, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
28/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 964 1414: Yes
28/11/23, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: Manhamo, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/11/23, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
28/11/23, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/11/23, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 964 1414: Ok I understand
28/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 204 5981: This program is a great chance to my  son   because  he will explore more  help in financially as a parent I am that my son he will be in good hands through his dreams
28/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 204 5981: My son is very lucky 💯 supportive
28/11/23, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

28/11/23, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/11/23, 9:45 am - +263 78 204 5981: Thank you that good I am really appreciate Edoofa for these programs
28/11/23, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: Mrs.Tecla, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
28/11/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 204 5981: This program will totally benefits my son 💯
28/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 204 5981: Now I have a clue picture on what is Edoofa on it's on .the uniqueness of Edoofa I feel my son to be qualified to your scholarship
28/11/23, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs.Tecla, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting Manhamo for higher education.
28/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 204 5981: Yes we will support him totally through out his education
28/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 964 1414: So fantastic that  continue to raise confidence my confidence in my dreams
28/11/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/11/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with your family in depth? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 964 1414: Yes
28/11/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
28/11/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 964 1414: Yes
28/11/23, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Manhamo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 964 1414: I see
28/11/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Please address the question.
28/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 204 5981: Ending paying $$2000-$2500
28/11/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs.Tecla, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/11/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 204 5981: For the whole process or the is on other costs will arise as we process
28/11/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 204 5981: So it's 750 + 350 =1100
28/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 204 5981: Please elaborate
28/11/23, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: No Mrs.Tecla, the Enrollment fee is taken so that we can apply to different colleges for Manhamo and not put a burden on you of those $2000-$2500 that one has to pay to apply to different internationally recognised universities. We reduce that burden to $750 but after COVID we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.
28/11/23, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: So for the enrollment, you just have to pay $350.
28/11/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 204 5981: Ok that's good at least I am understand  so when to pay and how
28/11/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: Let me first explain to you why are paying the enrollment fee.
28/11/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
28/11/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: Don’t you think so?
28/11/23, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
28/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 204 5981: I think  it's ok
28/11/23, 11:06 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
28/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 204 5981: Not yet
28/11/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 204 5981: My network now is week
28/11/23, 11:59 am - Gurvinder: I understand your problem but let us try to continue.
28/11/23, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Manhamo, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in your country itself. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
28/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 204 5981: I understand the process
28/11/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
28/11/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
28/11/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
28/11/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
28/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 204 5981: I would want to ask how  so when do we pay that $350 for the process fee
28/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 204 5981: I understand
28/11/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
28/11/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: However Mrs.Tecla, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 204 5981: Ok it's better
28/11/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
28/11/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
28/11/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

29/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 204 5981: 6 The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa. It is a program in which the students are doing it live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash.which can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop different  job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog  etc.
The EWYL Program, it's also help students   know how the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

In case you do not follow these terms then *Tanaka's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
29/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 964 1414: Thank you Mr Shuban

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

PERSONALITY TEST
"My Inspirational Story"
Inspirations of my life

 I believe that we all have inspirations in our lives, right? So at this moment I would like everyone to remember or think about someone who inspires you to get up every morning and motivates you to go to school. Now, I think everyone would agree that our inspirations are the source of our positivity when we are down, they are the ones who motivates us to do
I am the eldest child and I have been held responsible for everything that my parents tell us to do. My parents always had a high expectation from me and they hoped that I will be a good role model to my siblings. The responsibilities that were given to me gave me the opportunity to build a great relationship with my siblings, and as well gave me the chance to grow maturely at a very young age. I am very thankful to be blessed with such a loving family, and I know that they will continue to inspire me wherever life brings …show more content…
My friends and I are very close that we consider each other like siblings. I always feel that my day would not be complete without seeing them.Somewhere in life, we sometimes fail and we sometimes get hurt but there’s always someone behind who would aspire us to out shine ourselves in doing enormous things. They are the reason why we stand up again and learn to mend our wounds. They are our inspiration in life, our motivator and our strength to reach success. It has always been a part of our life’s voyage to encounter different challenges in life. In every achievement, frustrations and happiness in my life, my parents are always there at my side to guide and prop me up. I am so overwhelm and grateful for I have them as my parents. They are my inspiration in doing magnificent things of my life. Seeing them suffering while working too hard under the heat of the sun just to give us a good future inspires me. Because of their efforts and warmth love, I am so inspired to study hard and more persevered in achieving all my dreams in life. Having a debt of gratitude to them, I want to pay all their hard works by giving them a sufficient and marvelous life someday. I am studying hard not only for my self but also for my family . Without them i am nothing. Let us not think that having an inspiration is an interference towards achieving something. Instead, let us think that it is a way on how we are aggravated to reach our goals in life. Let's be inspired by the people around us who truly loves and supports us all the ways we take in life.

02/12/23, 6:17 pm - +263 78 964 1414: In Rwanda after 16 years the government makes no distinction between its two main ethnic groups, Hutus and Tutsis: ethnic identity cards are banned and national unity is promoted. But 10 years ago, the ethnic distinction was evident and turned deadly. From April to July 1994, Hutu extremists slaughtered 800,000 innocent Tutsis and moderate Hutus during a 100-day genocide while the world stood by, inactive and silent."The world silently watched and chose not to act. "Remembering Rwanda seeks not only to remember both the victims and survivors of the genocide, but also to pay tribute to the remarkable courage and vision of Rwandans who are undertaking the painful, difficult work of reconciliation and reconstruction.For the past 16 years the Africa Program has co-hosted events with the United States Institute of Peace, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Council on Foreign Relations, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Refugees International and other groups to commemorate the horrific events of 1994 and generate public conversation on lessons learned from the failure to act and about the international capacity to prevent such atrocities, or to intervene in the event of mass killings
In the past 16 years Rwanda's government has restored schools, hospitals, and basic civil services and ratified a new constitution, while the country has seen modest, steady economic growth. Kagame's Rwanda remains a traumatized society. Human rights advocates have criticized restrictions placed on the media and opposition parties. Other serious problems remain. The average life expectancy is only 40 years and an estimated 60 percent of Rwandans live below the poverty line.The government adopted a policy of open return and reconciliation for many of the former soldiers who participated in the genocide. In addition, the government has released tens of thousands of Hutus from prison who have been kept

11/12/23, 5:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
12/12/23, 8:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Tanaka and Ms Tecla @263789641414 @263782045981, How are you?

12/12/23, 9:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted please
12/12/23, 9:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
12/12/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 204 5981: Mode number 2
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738

12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 204 5981: 5 days or less
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, So Shall I provide you with a partial payment plan so that Tanaka does not miss on the scholarship opportunity?
12/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 204 5981: Yes it's far much better to me
12/12/23, 2:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me share with you the payment deadlines for the same:

1. *Since you are prepared with $100, You can pay the first initial $100 by tomorrow i.e. 13th of December 2023, before 12:00 PM CAT*

2. You can pay the next $100 before the 26th of December 2023.

3. And the remaining $189 (Including the Transaction charges) by the 20th of January 2023

This option will provide you nearly 40 days to pay Tanaka's enrollment fees. I hope this helps you to financially enrol Tanaka in the program, Isn't it?
