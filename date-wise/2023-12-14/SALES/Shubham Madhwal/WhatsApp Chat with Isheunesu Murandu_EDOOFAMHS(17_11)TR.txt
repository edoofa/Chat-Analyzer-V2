18/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 896 1096: In our local universities, there is no enough equipment and most of the electrical engineers in Zimbabwe have studied locally so I would want to study abroad for access to proper equipment and to learn new ways and perspectives and try to implement it in our country and universities from India are highly recognized on and the global market so I will be learning from the best
18/11/23, 1:20 pm - Tushti: I completely understand

22/11/23, 4:37 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 9:25 am - Tushti: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
23/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 896 1096: Morning ma'am
23/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 896 1096: Yes
23/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 71 896 1096: 3500 to 8000 per year
23/11/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/11/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/11/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/11/23, 10:56 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:56 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 10:56 am - Tushti: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/11/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 896 1096: Following
23/11/23, 11:01 am - Tushti: Now, let me brief you about the EWYL Program
23/11/23, 11:01 am - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/11/23, 11:01 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 11:01 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/11/23, 11:02 am - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*

23/11/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 896 1096: Yeah it is <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 11:32 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 896 1096: Yes
23/11/23, 11:34 am - Tushti: Isheunesu, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 896 1096: $1500 - $2250 <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 11:40 am - Tushti: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 11:40 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 11:40 am - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/11/23, 11:40 am - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 896 1096: Yes I think so <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: NAME basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
23/11/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/11/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
23/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 71 896 1096: Totally understand
23/11/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
23/11/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
23/11/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
23/11/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.
23/11/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
23/11/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
23/11/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
23/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 896 1096: Following
23/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 896 1096: No I totally understand
23/11/23, 12:15 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/11/23, 12:15 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 2 pm  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
23/11/23, 12:15 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

WHAT IS LIFE IN RWANDA LIKE 16 YEARS AFTER THE GENOCIDE THERE
In the late 1990s, there was a genocide was carried out by Hutu extremists against the Tutsi ethnic group in Rwanda. A lot of people were killed and it is considered one of the worst human rights atrocities in modern history. Life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has seen significant progress and transformation. The country has made remarkable strides in rebuilding and reconciliation, focusing on healing the wounds of the past and fostering national unity.Rwanda has implemented various initiatives to promote reconciliation and unity among its people. These include the Gacaca courts, which facilitated community-based justice and helped in addressing the crimes committed during the genocide. The government has also encouraged dialogue and community activities to promote healing and forgiveness. Rwanda has experienced steady economic growth in recent years. The government has implemented policies to attract foreign investment and promote sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing. This has led to increased employment opportunities and improved living standards for many Rwandans.Infrastructure Development: Rwanda has invested significantly in infrastructure development. The country has witnessed major improvements in roads, electricity, telecommunications, and access to clean water. This has enhanced connectivity and facilitated economic growth across the country. The government has prioritized education and healthcare services. Efforts have been made to improve access to quality education, especially at the primary level. Healthcare services have also seen improvements, with increased access to medical facilities and a decrease in preventable diseases.Rwanda has made substantial progress in gender equality. The country has one of the highest rates of female representation in parliament globally. Women's rights have been enshrined in legislation, and efforts have been made to empower women economically and politically.The government has implemented programs to promote social cohesion and combat ethnic divisions. These initiatives encourage dialogue, cultural events, and community activities that bring people from different backgrounds together.Rwanda actively remembers and commemorates the genocide to ensure that the world does not forget the atrocities that occurred. The annual Kwibuka ceremony is held to remember the victims and promote unity and healing.
While Rwanda has undoubtedly made significant progress, challenges remain. Issues such as poverty, access to justice, and mental health support for survivors still need to be addressed. However, the resilience and determination of the Rwandan people have been instrumental in rebuilding their lives and moving forward.

SECTION 6 PERSONALITY TEST
MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY

Becoming an electrical engineer has always been my dream from a young age till now. From a young age, I have always been fascinated by electricity works and some innovative solutions which it provide to the community. When  electric systems were installed at our house, I would watch them connecting the wire and I would ask for them to explain to me but I wouldn't understand because I didn't know anything. As I grew older my passion for this has increased. I have drawn inspiration from various source and I want to be one of the most recognized electrical engineers like  the most iconic electrical engineers which are Nicola Tesla is a true legend with numerous inventions  including the alternating current (AC) induction motor, which revolutionized the world of electrical engineering. He also pioneered the use of radio waves and wireless technology, and  is often credited with inventing the fluorescent light bulb and the remote control. Tesla was a true visionary, and his work continues to inspire and influence electrical engineers and aspiring electrical engineers. The dream intersified when I found out that I am good at physics and mathematic which are the most key subjects needed for a person to study electrical engineering. However in the journey to purse electrical engineering I have faced challenges especially with funding as I think of a lot of innovative ideas which can bring real change to the community but without funds I haven't been able to to any project which requires general knowledge of electricity to be done. Looking ahead through the Edoofa schorlaship program, I see my self as an innovative and hard working electrical engineer who will provide strategies to develop on sustainable energy solutions and advancement in technology and will have a positive impact on the community in introducing environmental sources of energy.  My journey towards becoming an electrical engineer  be from personal growth and passion and will always be influenced by my role models. I am confident that my dedication, passion and enthusiasm will guide me towards being one of the most successful electrical engineers.
