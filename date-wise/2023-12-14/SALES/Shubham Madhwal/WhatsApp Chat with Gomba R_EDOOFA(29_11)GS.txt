29/11/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Rachel, Mr.Gomba!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Yes it's me Rachel Sir
29/11/23, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Rachel,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Same here Sir. It's oky Sir
29/11/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Rachel, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Anotidaishe, is that correct?
29/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Yes Sir
29/11/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Anotidaishe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Anotidaishe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Edoofa Program is offering us a chance as Africans to study well in India and it is affordable. Anotidaishe told me that all is well with Edoofa his journey has been good. About his experiences he said it's been very exciting too.
29/11/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: I see you are well informed.
29/11/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
29/11/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/11/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/11/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/11/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Yes exactly Sir
29/11/23, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Rachel, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Yes Mr Gurvinder
29/11/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Rachel, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
29/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 797 0735: My Education status l did Arts at A level History Literature in English and Family and Religious studies. I want to study Arts specifically.

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.A. in Fine Arts*
29/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Oky Mr Gurvinder
29/11/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
29/11/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Yes l am confident Sir
29/11/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: So should I brief you about the course now?
29/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Yes you can go ahead
29/11/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: B.A. in Fine Arts is a foundation course involving concepts of various forms of visual and performing arts including painting, sculpture, architecture, music and poetry that are developed primarily for aesthetics or beauty rather than commercial application.

The course is spread over 3 academic years with 6 semesters in all, and 2 semesters in each academic year. Each semester contains a combination of theoretical classes, practical training, seminars and talks including a mandatory project submission in the last semester.

Successful graduates of BA in Fine Arts are employed in a variety of fields such as art studios, advertising companies and publishing houses. Other associated fields are product design, manufacturers, online services, publishing houses, software companies and magazines, where art graduates can work in positions such as Art Critic or Art Specialist.
29/11/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Artists and craftsmen also work as freelancers and sell their creations or display them in exhibitions. Although steady income is an issue for freelancers, people with outstanding talent can manage to receive equally outstanding payment for their exquisite work.

Within the field of fine arts field, success and job prospects depend on an individual's experience, creativity, market awareness, and talent. Some research scholars also step into the line of entrepreneurship and build their own businesses.
29/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Mr Gurvinder exactly what l want to do B A in Fine Arts. Thank you with the information .
29/11/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
29/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Studying fine arts can open up a lot of possibilities for someone's future. In five years, as for me with a B.A. in fine arts could be working as an artist, designer, or art teacher. They could also be working in a related field like advertising, publishing, or marketing. Or, they could even be working in a completely different field, using the skills they learned in their degree program to succeed in a different career. The possibilities are really endless. For Edoofa helping me achieve my dreams it is a dream come true because I believe with Edoofa it will happen
29/11/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Rachel, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
29/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Yes Sir l am willing to give it all for this career
29/11/23, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 797 0735: There are a lot of different reasons why I  choose to study abroad. For some reason it's about the opportunity to experience a different culture and learn about the world. Others might be interested in learning a new language or improving their language skills. And for some, it's about the opportunity to gain new perspectives and develop cross-cultural understanding. Additionally, many people choose to study abroad because it can be a great way to stand out on a resume and make connections in other parts of the world. Also in my country its very difficult to get jobs once you finish your studies. So l found India is the best
29/11/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
29/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Education abroad can have a big impact on a person's home country. For example, if l   study abroad l  may bring back new ideas and perspectives that can benefit my country. I  may also be able to use the skills and knowledge l gained abroad to start businesses or contribute to social or economic development in my  home country. Additionally, people who have studied abroad are often more open-minded and global-minded, which can make them more effective leaders and decision-makers in their home country.
29/11/23, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Rachel, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
29/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Yes I agree with you Sir
29/11/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
29/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 797 0735: Yes it's true Mr Gurvinder
29/11/23, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
29/11/23, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Section 5

Since the end of the Rwandan genocide in 1994, Rwanda has undergone a remarkable transformation. The country has made significant progress in terms of economic development, infrastructure, and social stability. The country has also made a strong commitment to reconciliation and justice, with a focus on building a society based on shared values of peace, unity, and reconciliation. Today, Rwanda is considered one of the safest countries in Africa and has seen rapid economic growth. However, the country still faces challenges related to poverty, inequality, and unemployment. But overall, the past 16 years have seen Rwanda move from a place of great tragedy to one of hope and progress.


Section 6
Another inspiring story is that of a girl named Rachel. When Rachel was 10 years old, her mother passed away from a terminal illness. This left Rachel feeling lost and alone. But with the help of her father and community, she was able to find the strength to move forward. She worked hard to stay on top of her schoolwork and became a role model for other children who had lost parents. Today, Rachel is a successful young woman who is pursuing her dreams with the same determination and resilience that got her through her mother's death.
