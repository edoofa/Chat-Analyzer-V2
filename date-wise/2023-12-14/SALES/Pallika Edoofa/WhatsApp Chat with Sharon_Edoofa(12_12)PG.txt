How are you doing today?
12/12/23, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Commencing the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Isheanesu ?*
12/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 799 3032: I am fine thank you

12/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 799 3032: My greatest  motivation  came from knowing that pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe as the time to time hiking of University  fees here in Zimbabwe is a great  hindrance   to aspiring  students  .

With the insight  that was provided by Isheanesu i  got an understanding  that the Edoofa   Scholarship program  makes it possible  for all students  to acquire quality  education  and this offers a competitive  advantage  in today's  world
12/12/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sharon, Thank you for sharing about this, and also I can see you are well-motivated. Please let me add more information to it.

My father is also a teacher. The first born in my family  is currently  a third year student  at the University of Zimbabwe  and doing Bachelors  of Social work.My younger sister  is currently  a form three student  at Murambinda Government  high school.

I appeared  for my A level in 2022 where  i was doing Accounting  ,Business and Enterprise Skills and Economics.  The course  i am interested  in is the Bachelor's of commerce.  I've  done my research  about  this programme and discovered  that it mothers most of commercial  faculties so it  offers  pathway  to be recognized by professional organizations .
