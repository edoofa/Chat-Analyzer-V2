09/12/23, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tatena, But do remember to share the pictures later!
09/12/23, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
09/12/23, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
09/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 083 4123: Okay
09/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 083 4123: L have not yet applied to any university abroad but l would like to study abroad

12/12/23, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tatenda, after reviewing your grades and subjects, I want to convey that for pursuing Radiography, one must have a background in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Since you don't have Chemistry and Biology, so you are not eligible for that, could you please share your alternative career aspirations?
12/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 083 4123: Okay
