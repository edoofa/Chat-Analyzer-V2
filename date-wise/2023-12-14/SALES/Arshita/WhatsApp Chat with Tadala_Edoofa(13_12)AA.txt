1)  *What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*

2) *What are your understandings of the program ?*
13/12/23, 10:36 am - +265 981 56 36 43: As u always know India provides one of the best tertiary education
13/12/23, 10:36 am - +265 981 56 36 43: I didn't understand it very to be honest
13/12/23, 10:37 am - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
13/12/23, 10:37 am - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
13/12/23, 10:37 am - Arshita: *I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity, aren't you?*
13/12/23, 10:39 am - +265 981 56 36 43: Yes I am
13/12/23, 10:40 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
13/12/23, 10:40 am - Arshita: As per the protocols of the program, the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary for the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So I am making you the admin of the group so please add them and let me know once they are added.*

In case they are not available right now, they can still be part of a group and catch up with the conversations later. Let me know the names with which I should address them.
