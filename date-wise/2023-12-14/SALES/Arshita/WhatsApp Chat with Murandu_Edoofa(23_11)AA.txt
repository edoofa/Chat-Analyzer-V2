24/11/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing. 

Please share form 5 results also
24/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 140 6552: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing.
24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Arshita: Why are your grades so low?
24/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 140 6552: Yes they are low but lm really sure that they will be different from my final results
24/11/23, 2:34 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 140 6552: Yes l am
24/11/23, 2:41 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
24/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 140 6552: No l didn't apply to any University yet
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.

12/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 140 6552: Can you resend the message
12/12/23, 9:37 am - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
12/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 140 6552: Studying in India will help get the best education and that will make my carrier better and more brighter
12/12/23, 9:58 am - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
12/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 71 140 6552: No I'm not
12/12/23, 10:01 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 10:01 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 10:01 am - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
12/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 71 140 6552: I don't think it's affordable
12/12/23, 10:05 am - Arshita: As you know,Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
12/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 140 6552: Yes
12/12/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
12/12/23, 4:12 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *8:30 am CAT on Wednesday(13/12/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.
