12/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 581 1385: How much are we supposed to pay like is it a fully funded scholarship or what.may you please elaborate on the funding process
12/12/23, 9:17 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
12/12/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 416 3602: I see
12/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Firstly, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
12/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 973 0051: How do l get credit scores and what do l use them for?

12/12/23, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tamuka, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

So are you aware that Mr Charles Jerera's son is in India under the Edoofa program?
12/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 973 0051: You are welcome, yes l have been told <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Well Tamuka now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
12/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Yes with studying abroad, one can experience new places and cultures, make friends from around the world, and gain a global perspective-while earning credits towards a degree. It will allow us as students to develop highly-valued skills such as intercultural communication, foreign languages, adaptability, and problem solving skills
12/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: That's definitely correct, Tamuka!

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
12/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Yes, but everyone has fear of being treated differently because of their skin tone
12/12/23, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand your concerns Tamuka.

Be assured that are students are our first priority.

So far having 2000+ plus students as a part of the program, no discrimination case has been shared by any student.

Feel free to request Mr Charles to connect you with his son as you would learn the best from a student himself.
12/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Ok,Thank you
12/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
12/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Yes,l am
12/12/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful

12/12/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Tamuka.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 973 0051: No
12/12/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
12/12/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/12/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/12/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Its really low
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Does it depend on the type of programme you are doing or its the same for any programme
12/12/23, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: It does depend on various aspects.
12/12/23, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Tamuka, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
12/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Oook...so do we get to choose the universtry or you already have specific  ones we should enrole in
12/12/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: You do get to choose the university after a discussion with your family.

Once you are a part of the program the Admissions Officer would get in touch and share the acceptance letters from the university where your application would have qualified for.

After that you and your decide finally.
12/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Oook thank you
12/12/23, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome.
12/12/23, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: Tamuka, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 973 0051: I do
12/12/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tamuka?
12/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Yes l do and thank you
12/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
12/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

12/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 973 0051: So whats is the maximum credit
12/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: I hope now you understand better please?
12/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Yes... l did understand
12/12/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Thank you for explaining
12/12/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Yes its very different Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Yes
12/12/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Tamuka, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/12/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 973 0051: $1750  --$2250
12/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tamuka, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Yes
12/12/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/12/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/12/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 973 0051: So when will the enrollment process start
12/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: After you are found eligible please.
12/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Ooook
12/12/23, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/12/23, 3:17 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Tamuka_Edoofa(11/12)HP" to "Tamuka_Edoofa(11/12)HP 2025"
12/12/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
12/12/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
12/12/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Yes l did
12/12/23, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
12/12/23, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Oook
12/12/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/12/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/12/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

Kindly feel free to connect with Mrs Ruth, Mrs and Mr Mabwe.
12/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Ok sure
12/12/23, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/12/23, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/12/23, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 973 0051: Thanks you
12/12/23, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome, Tamuka
12/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 973 0051: 🤝
13/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Tamuka, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
13/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 973 0051: Yes
13/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: So Tamuka, may I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?
13/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 973 0051: They said they will ask you
13/12/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Sure please,

By when shall I expect to hear from you?
13/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 973 0051: Yeaa...l am not sure yet
13/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: In that case, they can participate once available and we shall continue.

Is there anything that you would like to ask?
13/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 973 0051: Oook...no
13/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Alright please
13/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
13/12/23, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected please?

13/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 581 1385: How does this Earn while you learn  thing work
13/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

Were you able to go through the same?
13/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 581 1385: I've read through from my understanding it's more like learn while working ,which i think puts more pressure on the student because the more you work on projects the more you earn scholarship credits.i stand to be guided .
13/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 581 1385: Which language do they use to conduct their  lectures
13/12/23, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: Well Mrs Mabwe, Tamuka would be allotted a dedicated mentor while he is still in Zimbabwe who plans their schedule accordingly and their work on the projects during their free time.

Along with the same its a choice and not a compulsion please.

Their studies are most important, as in the earn while you learn program they learn skills that are required in the job world, credits come as an added benefit!
13/12/23, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
13/12/23, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: English please.
13/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 581 1385: Ok.undestood
13/12/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, what else is there anything that you would like to ask please?
13/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 581 1385: As of now no more questions but will ask as we go
13/12/23, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
13/12/23, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, however, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
