Are they willing to support you financially and mentally too?
11/12/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: I am glad they are supportive
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
11/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes im confident
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!

11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile do go through the shared video to learn more about the experience of our Proud Edoofians.

12/12/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.

13/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Ok
13/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome Aswell!

Did you thoroughly read everything?

If so, did you find the information helpful?
13/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes i found it helpful
13/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 691 7416: India is the best
13/12/23, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Aswell.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 691 7416: They are noy aware
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 691 7416: *t
13/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Thats affordable
13/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.
13/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are your thoughts on the same, Aswell?
13/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 691 7416: I need this opportunity.And thats more affordable
13/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
13/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Aswell, you are student at First Choice Learning Centre, isn't it?
13/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes
13/12/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Great, so are you aware we have students from your school who are currently in India and the ones who are a part of the program as we speak and would be coming to India next year and in 2025?
13/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Not i am not aware . Can you tell me their names
13/12/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, let me request the Academic Board for the list of names.
13/12/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Aswell, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
13/12/23, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: Randy Cleopatra Yule
Shaun MUPonda

These two are currently in India while they are many who are currently in Zimbabwe and would be traveling in August 2024.
13/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Oooh ok
13/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes i agreee its not favorable
13/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Aswell?
13/12/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, however, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
