12/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Duly received Mrs Engelina.

From what you have expressed, she surely seems to be a great student who is dedicated and equally hardworking.

It's great to know that she is fond of exploring.
12/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 388 4904: ok thank you
12/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: So Mrs Engelina, what motivates Viola to pursue a career in Biotechnology or Agricultural Engineering please?
12/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 388 4904: Biotechnology has a potential to improve human health, increase food production especially in our society looking at the current situation in our country it also helps in devoleping new and sustainable energy sources for the people
12/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 388 4904: She also wants to pursue agricultural engineering because she has a passion in farming she always says that one day she wants to own her own farm where she would be carrying out her farm products such as crop production and livestock production
12/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: While I completely understand what you are sharing Mrs Engelina, I am glad she has a thorough understanding of her aspirations!

However did you or Viola ever happen to research about these two courses and fields please?
12/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 388 4904: Agriculture engineering also help create sustainable solutions to the world's growing food need, while also protecting the environment and also improving the lives of the people in the rural areas and also within the community
12/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 388 4904: Yes
12/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Indeed please
12/12/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: So what all did you learn regarding the requirements for both the fields please?
12/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 388 4904: They are both helpful in different ways
12/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Alright please.
12/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: You see, since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 388 4904: Ok noted
12/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, now considering her interests and subject combination, she is eligible to pursue the following:

*Bachelor of science in Biotechnology*
*Bachelor of science in Agriculture*
12/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Ok thank you

13/12/23, 9:27 am - Harmehak: Mrs Engelina, Now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
13/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 388 4904: Ok
13/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 388 4904: This is because India has some of the top ranked universities in the world and it also offers high quality education at an affordable cost
13/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: That's very correct, Mrs Engelina.
13/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

13/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: You can go through the resources as well please, Mrs Engelina.
13/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 388 4904: Ok
13/12/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Were you able to follow the shared information, Mrs Engelina?
13/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 388 4904: Yes
13/12/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Mrs Engelina.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
13/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 388 4904: No
13/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Alright please
13/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 77 388 4904: Noted
13/12/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Engelina, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
13/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 388 4904: noted thank you
13/12/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
13/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Mrs Engelina, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
13/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 388 4904: I do
13/12/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Indeed, so now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Viola?
13/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 388 4904: Yes I am
13/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
13/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
13/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
13/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

13/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 388 4904: Ok
13/12/23, 11:21 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
13/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 388 4904: Noted
13/12/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

13/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 388 4904: Yes I do
13/12/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
13/12/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow please, Mrs Engelina?
13/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Yes I did
13/12/23, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: Are you ready please?
13/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Yes
13/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Engelina, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
13/12/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
13/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Ok
13/12/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: Please?
13/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Something like $2250
13/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 388 4904: For 5 universities
13/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
13/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
13/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Engelina, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
13/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Ok
13/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Ok
13/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 388 4904: I think so
13/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Ok thank you
13/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
13/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
13/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

13/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Noted
13/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
13/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
13/12/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
13/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Yes I do
13/12/23, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
13/12/23, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
13/12/23, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

13/12/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

13/12/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
13/12/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
13/12/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
