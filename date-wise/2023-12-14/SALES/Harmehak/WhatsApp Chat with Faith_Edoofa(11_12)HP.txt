12/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: I understand please
12/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: How was your experience?
12/12/23, 9:45 am - +260 96 8629973: It was very encouraging and motivational especially because I saw many people around the world share their story about the edoofa program and also the key statement on employment and the pick up at the airport.
12/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 9:57 am - +260 96 8629973: Thank you so very much for the information..... I would like to know more about the  eligibility of the 50-100% scholarship and the employability outcomes
12/12/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
12/12/23, 10:11 am - +260 96 8629973: I see... Going back to the video, credits on sponsorship's where mentioned and I would like for you to elaborate more on that as well
12/12/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: I will discuss the same in detail.
12/12/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Serah, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mr Mumba better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
12/12/23, 10:38 am - +260 96 8629973: Thank you so much. I am a mother of 5 children, 3 girls and 2 boys, Faith being the first born of the Mumba family. I am a teacher by profession, having a degree as my highest qualifications. As Mr Mumba he is a self employed Businessman. The reason why we have decided to support our daughter to further her education is because we know that she will get more exposed in achieving her dream career as well as setting an example to her younger siblings and be able to help not only the family but the world at large.
12/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mrs Serah, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
12/12/23, 10:52 am - +260 96 8629973: Thank you very much
12/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: So Mrs Serah, now as we proceed ahead with the discussion, I would like to know Faith better as a student,

How she is at school, her interests and hobbies, what exactly she would like to pursue?

Do tag along her A level subject combination and O level results.
12/12/23, 11:06 am - +260 96 8629973: Faith is an 18 year old girl who studied at tarcisia floriana convent secondary boarding school in solwezi for five years till she completed this year. Her academic performance has always been good and impressing there for as a family we are expecting good results from her. 
Faith is interested in reading books, traveling, singing, and swimming as a sport and also spending time with her family and friends. 
Faith took English language, mathematics, science, Biology, religious Education, civic education and accounts whilst in school
12/12/23, 11:06 am - +260 96 8629973: And as for the o level results will be released next year February
12/12/23, 11:09 am - +260 96 8629973: She has always talked about wanting to be a surgical doctor since child hood and venturing mostly as a neurological doctor..... Therefore we feel India is the best country which offers medical courses
12/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: That's well expressed Mrs Serah.

It's a pleasure to know more about Faith.

I can see she is a dedicated and a hardworking student.
12/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Did her science subject include Physics and Chemistry please?
12/12/23, 11:32 am - +260 96 8629973: Yes they did
12/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
12/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: What motivates her to pursue a career in medical field, Mrs Serah?
12/12/23, 11:39 am - +260 96 8629973: Whilst she was young her aunt who's currently a nurse introduced her to the Ben Carson movie and bought her books by him..... She literally encouraged her to be a neurological doctor  like Ben Carson who was of course hard working and God fearing.... She then exposed her to the knowledge of life in the hospital and how she could help save lives of people by not only treating them but encouraging them and beirkind to them.... As we speak now she has been researching a lot about the medical field, downloading apps and books to help her on the the road and seeking more information from experienced medical practitioners
12/12/23, 11:55 am - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Mrs Serah.

I can see her aunt had a great impact and she realised she wishes to work in the medical field.

It's good to know that she wishes to do well for others.
12/12/23, 11:56 am - Harmehak: You see, it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.
12/12/23, 11:57 am - Harmehak: But I realize that she wants to do a course that makes you, the parent proud and also align with her passion. So she can go ahead with the courses like:

*1. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
*2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy*
*3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*4. Bachelors in Optometry*
*5. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
12/12/23, 12:16 pm - +260 96 8629973: Okey...those will be put into consideration
12/12/23, 12:18 pm - +260 96 8629973: I want to know if it's possible for you to help us find a university that offers neurological surgery that is conducive and good for our girl even though it is not sponsorship based
12/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: You see Mrs Serah, she won't be able to pursue Medicine in India because of the requirements of NEET examination.
12/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: While the Indian students too prepare for it day and night, only 1000 are selected each year out of the millions.
12/12/23, 12:52 pm - +260 96 8629973: Okey thank you for the information...... We will get back to you for the offered options once we discuss it with her
12/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please,

So far do you have any queries for me?
12/12/23, 1:02 pm - +260 96 8629973: No I don't
12/12/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So far, shall I brief you about any of these courses?
12/12/23, 1:35 pm - +260 96 8629973: Do you by any chance offer public health services
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - +260 96 8629973: ??
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: NEET is a mandatory requirement for the same as well.
12/12/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
13/12/23, 9:11 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
