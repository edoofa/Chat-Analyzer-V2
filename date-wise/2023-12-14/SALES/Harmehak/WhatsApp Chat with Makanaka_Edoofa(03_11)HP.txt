I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Shingirirai College charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
11/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Yes thats what l believe
11/12/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright, and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?

11/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 105 2450: They are supportive,l have already told them on the family gathering last week
11/12/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Well that's good
11/12/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
11/12/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 105 2450: I promise to have 14points
11/12/23, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: That's the spirit

11/12/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
11/12/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

12/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Its a priority Ms
12/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 105 2450: I forget to ask do you have universities in Africa
12/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Education abroad is more advance than in Africa ,plus its a peaceful place for education thre will be no disturbances
12/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: You see, Makanaka, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
12/12/23, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: No please, we offer scholarship only to those who wish to study in India, Makanaka.
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok l now understand it
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Education abroad is more advance than in Africa ,plus its a peaceful place for education thre will be no disturbances
12/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Noted,okay okay l now get it
