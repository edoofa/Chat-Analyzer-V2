This what makes me interested to apply for the scholarship
22/11/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Tinashe, so, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/11/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

24/11/23, 9:23 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared document, Tinashe?
24/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 119 0510: Still downloading network was the challenge yesterday

24/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Now l am done with the document
24/11/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
24/11/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Edoofa is therefore to provide afodability for higher and quality education to deserving students, in various prestigious universities in India, apart from afodability, Edoofa is also therefore to provide employability to the Edoofa learning students. It provides internship to the learning students, thereby giving students opportunities of earning while learning, this as result helps students to the chances of credibility and it is a chance of reducing their fees loans. By doing so, it creates a strong hard working   and well experience with high quality level of knowledge.
24/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you earlier, so now I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
25/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 119 0510: In terms of financial aspects, it is a well designed program, which is helpful for deserving students, for it provides a room to allow students to have loans and at the same time providing internships to students as a way of depreciating their debt balance. Bt it is a bit complex to those who are less previladge or those who didn't manage to get a sponsor for the scholarships process execution. And to those who didn't manage to get a 100% scholarship. I understand it is also good to the organisation, for it is also a sicial profit organization. Yaar that's my understanding
27/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 119 0510: Ok
27/11/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Hello Everyone,

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
27/11/23, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
27/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Apologies for time miss out
28/11/23, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Apologies for late response
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 119 0510: We can
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So did you understand the following too?
28/11/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Ok l understand
28/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 119 0510: So l must supposed to take care of0$3000 for myself that's what you mean
28/11/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: What did you understand from the same please?
28/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 119 0510: My understanding is, the scholarship will take of 62.5% of the university expenses per year and the student will  care of the remaining 37.5% of the expenses. And if l approved to be doing well in  evaluation, there gonna be a further reduction in of the fee or get an opportunity of earning while learning so that l can be able to take care of the remaining fee balance, that is my understanding from above script.
28/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Tinashe.
28/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: So did you discuss the same with your parents too?

02/12/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: What all did you discuss with them, Tinashe?
02/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 119 0510: I told them all about how the scholarship works on funding students, l told them abt the internships program which the scholarship give to the deserving students, I told them abt the reason why this scholar program is mainly centralized in India than in other countries, I told them abt hw Edoofa helps students to get visas.
02/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

I am glad you had an elaborated discussion.

So far are there any queries for me?
02/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 119 0510: And l told them also abt hw the scholar will take care of varsity expenses
02/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
02/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 119 0510: Yaar their concern and my concern abt, the flight number  one, 2, what if l didn't get an approval of getting an opportunity of getting an internship or a part time job, so that I can earn while I Learn, since l am from a less previladges financial background, does it work well for me?. I need yr yr advice from this question.
02/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Can you please properly rephrase your question without using any abbreviations, Tinashe?
02/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 119 0510: I told the that the approximate value per year for university expenses is about $8000, and there is a chance that the scholarship can help the student to reduce this amount to $3000,meaning that the scholarship have reduced the burden of the university expenses by 67.5% and the student will take care of the remaining 37, 5%. And then if a student gets an opportunity to get an internship or a part-time job, it will be easy for a student to take care of this 37.5% because he or she will be earning while learning, he/she will be able to pay little by little until he/she finished studies
02/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 119 0510: Ok
02/12/23, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Very correct Tinashe
02/12/23, 11:56 am - Harmehak: So, are your parents willing to support you with $1500 a year?
02/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 119 0510: What l am saying is, my parents was asking about how did the scholarship take care of flights in case the student is approved to study with Edoofa program, that is the first issue, secondly what if a student got an opportunity to study with Edoofa scholarship, and he/she did not get an approval of having an internship or part time job for earning while learning, since someone like me is from a less previladged financial background, doe it work well with me to cover the remaining costs like this 37.5% of the remaining university expenses or there are other options of payment plans
02/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes
02/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 119 0510: How this can be payed, the whole figure once a year or in artitions per semester?
02/12/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Tinashe, firstly may I know if you are clear that Edoofa offers scholarship on tuition fee itself?
02/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Not so clear
02/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly read the document?
02/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes l did bt l didn't clearly understand it
02/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 119 0510: In terms of tuition fees and university expenses
02/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Now are you clear that Edoofa offers scholarship on tuition fee itself, Tinashe?
02/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 119 0510: Yes its now clear
02/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Now do you have any queries?

02/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: My question was if you have followed everything?
