What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

From my interactions with students in the edoofa program, I've learned that they're grateful for the support they've received. The program has helped them gain access to educational resources they wouldn't have had otherwise. In addition, the program has given them a sense of community and belonging. They feel like they're part of a group of people who are all working towards the same goal of improving their education. I've also learned that the program has helped them become more confident in their academic abilities. They've gained new skills and knowledge, and they feel more prepared for the future.


Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
Because I have great potential and will work hard to exceed my potential and bring positive changes to my people.
