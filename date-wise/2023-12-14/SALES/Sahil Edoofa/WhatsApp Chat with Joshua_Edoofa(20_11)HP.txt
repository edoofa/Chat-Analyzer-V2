20/11/23, 4:56 pm - +27 74 243 3513: First of all, i would like  thank God for the recommendation of Edoofa to me by my friend Lorraine . Edoofa came in to rescue me from the hustle of attaining my higher level of education abroad. So far Edoofa would be my one number recommendation to anyone who would like to further their education in India. It has always been my dream to attain higher quality education as I was inspired by some of my friends who did their courses abroad and  Edoofa scholarship is also very affordable and it helps in finding employment which is the main problem we are facing as students. Edoofa is a platform for students to pursue Affordable Higher Education in India through Scholarships and Internships.
20/11/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Joshua, I appreciate your kind words, now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

20/11/23, 5:18 pm - +27 74 243 3513: This is the main reason i choose to fit myself into Edoofa program and become an Edoofian 👏
20/11/23, 5:19 pm - +27 74 243 3513: That's really motivational to everyone
20/11/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
20/11/23, 5:27 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Joshua, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Mwenezi government high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
20/11/23, 5:43 pm - +27 74 243 3513: I am a focused hardworking boy aged 23. I am a second born in our family and christianity by
religion. I grew up being assisted financially and socially by my parents and were not able afford my school fees and this creates an opportunity to find this Edoofa program scholarship awards to further my knowledge and have higher quality education recommended world wide. 

 I am eager to leverage the resources and facilities provided by Edoofa to further my knowledge from esteemed professors and collaborating with like minded individuals excites me, and i am determined to make the most of every learning opportunity.

Beyond the classroom, i believe in the power of innovation and have been actively involved in research projects and competitions. I aspire to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of Veterinary Sciences through my ideas and initiatives.I solemly dedicate myself to aiding animals and society by providing excellent care and service for animals, by alleviating animal suffering and promoting public health. I really passionate about animals and that's why i plan on majoring in Veterinary Science.

As i stand at the threshold of higher
education , I see Edoofa program as a gateway to fulfilling my dreams and making a positive impact on the world. I am committed to excellence, hardworking. 

As an underpriviledged child my parents had no money to fund me for tertiary education. My parents owns a small scale farm for a living and thats all. My parents are failing to put food on the table as for now and I'm imagining for the other fees where to get the funds kindly I am looking for your assistance. At Mwenezi Government High school, I was paying 109 us dollars per term and was not easy for my parents to pay my school fees. I was doing campus jobs like feeding cattles for the school and it also increased my passion in being a Veterinary Science. According to my background, I do not have any other financial support from any relative and it brings me to this point of still waiting for my tertiary level from 2019.
20/11/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: Well received Joshua, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself.

I completely understand and I am glad that your parents that are putting in all efforts despite the hardships.
20/11/23, 5:51 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you, they are trying by all means to put food and fees in one place but it's not easy since my brother is also furthering in Veterinary Science at University of Zimbabwe. And from the time he started my parents end up giving up and he was sponsored a work study scholarship by the school and my parents are now paying rent and food only. I have also my sister and my young brother at Mwenezi Government High school now. This put me under trap and it creates an opportunity to for me to grab any opportunity that will rise up. Am grateful to meet 👏
20/11/23, 5:53 pm - +27 74 243 3513: . Am grateful and blessed to meet you on this platform 👏
20/11/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand the situation Joshua!

However may I know your understanding of the financial aspect of the scholarship please?

What expenses are catered for as per you please?
20/11/23, 6:05 pm - +27 74 243 3513: I understand through internet and some of my friends who were telling me that Edoofa program help motivated and unprevileged students from 50% to 100% of their tuition fees. Am not sure about their living expenses and I hope you can briefly explain it to me and my parents will also get it very well. If I am fortunate enough to get this scholarship, I will be 100% committed to my studies and I will repay the trust you will have shown in me by being a model student, by supporting others and by ensuring I achieve my goals.”
20/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So what's your understanding of a 100% scholarship, Joshua?
20/11/23, 8:08 pm - +27 74 243 3513: When a student is awarded an 100% scholarship, all his tuition fee will be covered by the Edoofa program. Edoofa program also help students to earn scholarships credits through Earn While You Learn program. Under this program Edoofa has created opportunities from different companies and have been broken into small projects and tasks.

 These credits can also benefits a student in reducing his/her fees.I understand lots of students apply for scholarships and I would hope my future ambitions, and my promise that I will be totally committed to my studies, make me a strong applicant.”
20/11/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to see you have proper awareness and knowledge, Joshua!
20/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Joshua, you completed your A level in 2019 please?
20/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

20/11/23, 8:51 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Yes, i completed my A level 2019 but from that time up to now, we were trying to raise money for my tertiary education but all the things were not flowing to our side.
21/11/23, 6:51 am - +27 74 243 3513: Morning Ms Harmehak, Mr Sahil and Mr Jyotishman👏

I believe i deserve this scholarship because I have genuine, achievable plans for my career and i also understand i will only achieve those if i apply myself throughout my studies. I’ve been reading and watching this video and it has taught me the importance of applying yourself and being consistent in the work you do, and also making sure you do it to the right standard.  I have big ambitions for my future. Am happy to hear about Earn While You Learn program as i also enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction books and I usually dedicate some time to my own personal development and being on this program will improve even my skills and critical thinking skills. As an older student, it will be easy to stay motivated, time management and prioritization of tasks because I knew this is the direction i wanted my life to go and I wanted to do it as well as i possibly could to open up as many opportunities as i can. Am so happy that they are some students who are so proud to be Edoofians and they are also happy with Earn While You Learn as these projects are improving their communication skills and being confident. I can't wait to see everyone who is under Edoofa scholarship program and will testify all these good moments we are having.
21/11/23, 6:53 am - +27 74 243 3513: I read all this pdf and am happy about all the steps which are written for guidance and giving us more detailed information about Edoofa. 👏
21/11/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I would be connecting with you at *12 PM CAT today* since I have to attend an urgent meeting.
21/11/23, 10:12 am - +27 74 243 3513: Am doing well and I hope you have a blessed day there.👏

I will be there *12 PM CAT*
21/11/23, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Thank you Joshua
21/11/23, 10:14 am - +27 74 243 3513: 👏
21/11/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Hello Everyone!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/11/23, 12:05 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Yes we can 👏
21/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that. <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Well expressed and we look forward to the same.
21/11/23, 12:18 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you, I really appreciate that👏
21/11/23, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
21/11/23, 12:33 pm - +27 74 243 3513: I understand, Edoofa believe that university education should be affordable, accessible and should lead to employment. Edoofa has found its home in some of the best educational institutions of India imparting quality education to all its students and into many programs. Edoofa understand that going to a university is life-changing, and Edoofa aimed to provide a first-class experience for students and  not only get the chance to experience some great facilities but also explore a plethora of opportunities. Every moment that a student spends on campus helps in shaping their bright future and develop the skillset that an employer demands and so so glad to here this from Edoofa essays.
Edoofa is a platform for students to pursue affordable higher education in India as compared to other countries with higher tuition fee rates.

Edoofa program also helps students through Earn While You Learn program which reduce tuition fee per year of a student if he manage to earn more. I understand that these scholarships credits earned are directly send to the school to cover a certain portion of your tuition remaining again and can not be given to a student in hand cash. I understand that, there are some students who are even managing to make 100 us per month through EWYL program and some few motivated and analytical students excell above and it's amazing to hear. Some students are testifying that, they are now independent in paying tuition fee 👏
21/11/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Well received and I can see you thoroughly read the document.

Did you understand the following regarding the financial aspect too?
21/11/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/11/23, 12:42 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Yes i understand it as i go through the whole document.👏
21/11/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

Did you happen the discuss the same with your family too?
21/11/23, 12:57 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Yes, i discussed it with them after going through the whole document and research how Edoofa Scholarship works. I don't know if it guaranteed that every student is only awarded a 50% scholarship then will reduce some expenses and tuition fees using EWYL program. I just see like you consider from 50% to 100% scholarship. If i will eligible to get a certain percentage of scholarship around 80% to 100%, i can manage to pay the remaining through EWYL program. My parents told me that they can't even afford to pay because my young brother and sister  there are also going to high school now and they are also paying rent to my brother at University. Am here in South Africa to work and try to balance as much as i can.
21/11/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand Joshua.
21/11/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: However so far are you clear that you would require financial support from your parents please?
21/11/23, 1:13 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Considering my financial circumstances, I would like to humbly request your kind consideration for a scholarship. With financial assistance, I will be able to alleviate the financial burden on my family, allowing me to focus wholeheartedly on my studies and extracurricular activities. I assure you that your investment in me will not be in vain, as I am determined to make the most of this opportunity and strive for excellence in every aspect of my academic journey.

My parents can not manage to cover me financially as they were failing at my high school level where i was paying 109 dollars. I was used to do cattle fees to cover my fees. I will be grateful to be awarded an Edoofa scholarship that will allow me to cover my tuition fee through EWYL programs. You can put me under many tasks to do to cover everything and am motivated to it.
21/11/23, 1:18 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you for your understanding and being kind to me 👏
21/11/23, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: It's great to see you are willing to put immense efforts, Joshua!

However how would you manage your other expenses please?
21/11/23, 1:36 pm - +27 74 243 3513: I came here in South Africa 2022 in April and started working from June. From that time up to now i was working under a certain target knowing that my dreams are the seeds of greatness, the sparks that ignite fire within me. I managed to arrange only 2000us for my expenses.

Am a motivated student who understands that knowledge is the key that unlock endless possibilities and I have to dive deep  into my dreams. I really want to use this opportunity of being an Edoofian so that I will earn my first class level of education in India 👏
21/11/23, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: That's well thought off, Joshua!

However my query is regarding how would you manage your other expenses once in India, since you cannot work on a student visa please.
21/11/23, 1:45 pm - +27 74 243 3513: All other expenses, i can manage, my only challenge is on how I will get my tuition fee and is the main reason am seeking assistance from the Edoofa scholarship program as a financially disadvantaged student. 👏This opportunity will not only benefit me but will also put positive impact on the world . Under EWYL program, I believe I will be a dedicated and responsible student that will be a testimony to everyone 👏
21/11/23, 1:51 pm - +27 74 243 3513: I am fully aware of the abundant opportunities and resources that Edoofa program offers its students, and I am eager to seize them. I am committed to making a positive contribution to both the Edoofa community and society at large. Given my background and the challenges I have faced, I genuinely believe that my unique experiences will bring a diverse perspective to the Edoofa community and the university i will study through your support 👏.
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Joshua.

It's great to see that you are willing to do all it takes for your education.
21/11/23, 2:06 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you, I do appreciate everything we shared👏
21/11/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Joshua, are you clear that even if you score a 80-100% scholarship, you would require financial support please?
21/11/23, 2:10 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Yes am aware of it that they are some expenses which i will need to save as basic needs n wants but the fact that am covered on my tuition fees,i will be grateful and the rest i will manage, i promise 👏
21/11/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright Joshua,

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 80- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2000* a year, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
21/11/23, 2:19 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Okh i understand, what if am supposed to pay 1600 and i get enrolled into EWYL which i can excel like 100 per month meaning to say, within a year, I will pay my 1000us dollar fee from my tasks earnings and I will only remain to pay 600us per year? I heard some students testifying that EWYL makes them now able to pay their tuition fee in advance 👏
21/11/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, which surely is true!

So may I know how would you manage the remaining fee please?
21/11/23, 2:31 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Before arival, I will just make sure am with 600dollars by 5 making 3000us knowing that i will manage to pay the remaining fee for 4 or 5yrs. My dream is build my life and to raise my parents also from the level which they are now.
21/11/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: I admire the dedication and commitment, Joshua.

May I know if you happen to encounter any other expenses, how would they be managed?
21/11/23, 2:43 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Am not sure and aware of it as a student who is willing for everything to be going well until i finished my studies. Under any circumstances, i will contact my parents and with their small portions of money, i hope and have confidence that they will assist me. If it comes to pay 50Us or less per month i know they can afford and that's the reason am not much worried about minor expenses. 👏
21/11/23, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

Your dedication is indeed admirable, Joshua.
21/11/23, 2:45 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you, i really appreciate 👏
21/11/23, 8:21 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/11/23, 8:24 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Evening 👏
Okh thank you, I will be available by that time tomorrow.
21/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
22/11/23, 9:01 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
22/11/23, 9:02 am - +27 74 243 3513: Good morning👏.

Yes we can start, am here and ready for the discussion 👏
22/11/23, 9:15 am - Harmehak: Wonderful,

So Joshua, can you share your academic results with me?

22/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Sure please
22/11/23, 9:18 am - +27 74 243 3513: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 9:18 am - +27 74 243 3513: <Media omitted>

22/11/23, 9:22 am - +27 74 243 3513: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 9:36 am - Harmehak: Duly received, Joshua!

So did you ever happen to research regarding the requirements of your desired course too?
22/11/23, 9:39 am - +27 74 243 3513: Yes i do a lot of  research and i also get much advices from my school teachers and some of the veterinarians from our country and also from my brother who is now in third year doing Veterinary Science in Zimbabwe.
22/11/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: That's great!
22/11/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: You see, Joshua, since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
22/11/23, 9:57 am - +27 74 243 3513: Yes i do understand it and it becomes a reason why i did not choose an engineering program as i was only doing an animal and human science related subject(biology). I decided to take Maths, Biology and Chemistry to suit my dream career
22/11/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: I can understand.
22/11/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
22/11/23, 10:03 am - +27 74 243 3513: I did not do any research about those programs before in which i can stand and say all of these programs am willing to do this one since my researches were much based in animal health caring. I do read some of the veterinary books part time to make me understand and gain more knowledge of it. My career goals is only to be a Veterinary Doctor and i do have that dream from my childhood.
22/11/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing Joshua and equally admire your dedication.

However you cannot pursue Medicine with your subject combination.
22/11/23, 10:14 am - +27 74 243 3513: I can pursue medicine as i do Maths, Biology and Chemistry, the same as some who just do Maths, Physics and Chemistry but it will separate us in the field of specialization in which one will be a Physician Doctor and the other will be a Biomedical Doctor etc. Am will to earn Bachelors degree in Veterinary Science and after that I will proceed to get Masters in Veterinary Science. After that i will wrote an exam which will give me a name of being a Veterinary Doctor or Surgeon Veterinary Doctor. I can not be a doctor with only a bachelors but i have to study further more to be a doctor
22/11/23, 10:24 am - +27 74 243 3513: I solemly dedicate myself to aiding animals and society by providing excellent care and service for animals, by alleviating animal suffering and promoting public health. I really passionate about animals and that's why i plan on majoring in Veterinary Science.
22/11/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: While I completely understand what you are sharing, Joshua 

Kindly note that in India, the requirements are Physics, Chemistry and Biology.
22/11/23, 10:32 am - +27 74 243 3513: Yes i do understand i you choose between Physics and Biology depending on the carrier goal i have in life. I can not do engineering as i was doing biology and i get it. And you someone can not deal more with plants and animals when he/she was doing physics. Those two subjects determines where to go since they are too different subjects and have different syllabus.
22/11/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I do understand Joshua!

So far do you have any queries?
22/11/23, 10:38 am - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you. 👏.

I do not have any query, as you are making everything clear to me 👏
22/11/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words.
22/11/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Are you clear that you can only pursue these courses itself with your subject combination?

If so, which course are you intrigued towards?
22/11/23, 10:56 am - +27 74 243 3513: Maybe if i will do some researches between those programs first then i will come back to you. 👏. I can lie if i will select now because it will be guess work not passion towards that program
22/11/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: I do understand, Joshua.

While I can help you with the details, which course did you find interesting?
22/11/23, 11:07 am - +27 74 243 3513: Kindly, can I know if you help to be offered Bachelors degree in Pharmacy?
22/11/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: No please, physics is required for the same.
22/11/23, 11:18 am - +27 74 243 3513: Am not that sure, maybe it's only in India where they required physics in doing pharmacy. Can i get much details in Bachelors Degree of Physiotherapy 👏
22/11/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Sure please
22/11/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

22/11/23, 4:25 pm - +27 74 243 3513: 👏
23/11/23, 9:03 am - +27 74 243 3513: Morning 👏
23/11/23, 9:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
23/11/23, 9:03 am - +27 74 243 3513: Yes, we can start
23/11/23, 9:12 am - Harmehak: Alright Joshua, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/11/23, 9:22 am - +27 74 243 3513: In five years I would like to expand my horizons by jumping in feet first and learning as much as I can, as quickly as I can, with my program. From there, I'd seek out opportunities at least one to two a year to expand my knowledge through training and educational opportunities to support my job. I'd love to participate in at least one project geared toward leadership training, if the opportunity arises. I also understand that the Physiotherapy has a strong volunteer team, and I'd like to be an active participant of that team, as well. At some point, I'd also like to be considered for a supervisory or management level role."
23/11/23, 9:22 am - +27 74 243 3513: I am eager to leverage the resources and facilities provided by
Edoofa program to further my knowledge from esteemed professors and collaborating with like-minded
individuals will also help me in my career skills, and i am determined to make the most of every learning opportunity. As i stand at the threshold of higher
education , I see Edoofa program scholarship as a gateway to fulfilling my dreams and making a positive
impact on the world. I am committed to excellence, hardworking and continous growth, and I
assure you that i will be a dedicated and responsible student with Edoofa program.
23/11/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: That is really great Joshua, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/11/23, 9:58 am - +27 74 243 3513: By studying abroad, I will gain a new perspective and i can take unique classes i wouldn’t be able to take back home.I can learn history through immersive experiences and it will improve my ability to adapt fast. I will gain independence and as I will be now able to come with possible solutions on my own.

I will gain international experience and a global network and  can immerse myself in another language. 
I will be able to see the contrast between living abroad and short-term travel and seeing new places. I will develop life-long friendships by immersing myself in a new culture,i will also be exposed to a new language, new perspectives, foreign foods, and life-changing experiences. All of this will change the way i see the world and my role in it. 

I will make lifelong connections by sharing new experiences, i can’t help but connect deeply with other students in my cohort and at my partner institutions and  i will share many new experiences while studying abroad.
23/11/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: That is wonderful and well expressed, Joshua, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
23/11/23, 10:12 am - +27 74 243 3513: I research ed that, India is the birthplace of the world’s greatest religions and history, and it offers a wide range of courses for study to international students.

23/11/23, 10:24 am - +27 74 243 3513: 100% true ✅
23/11/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Joshua

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/11/23, 10:39 am - +27 74 243 3513: Yes, we are familiar with the cost which is much affordable as compared to European countries, USA, UK and some other countries. And by being affordable, it will now depends on how much you earn per year because sometimes to some parents 500us it's too much and to the majority is much affordable. I don't know if you get my sense👏
23/11/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: I can understand.
23/11/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/11/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/11/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:48 am - +27 74 243 3513: Kindly, Can i get much information about this information because am not getting it well. How it is like if you get an award of 80 to 100% , you still needed to pay 1600usd to 2000usd as you said yesterday. Maybe am lost in what 100% mean or do you use calculations in reducing these tuition fee. I really need help on this👏
23/11/23, 10:50 am - +27 74 243 3513: I get it 👏
23/11/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: While I would brief you regarding the same as well, Joshua.

Considering your documents and results you donot qualify for a 100% scholarship on Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy please.
23/11/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: However considering your results you can qualify for a 100% scholarship on Bachelor of science in medical laboratory Technology.
23/11/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Along with Bachelor of science in Nutrition and Dietetics please
23/11/23, 11:00 am - +27 74 243 3513: I do understand. Can i be part of that Bachelors degree in Medical Laboratory Technology please 👏. I do need an 100% Edoofa scholarship as a financially disadvantaged student 👏
23/11/23, 11:00 am - +27 74 243 3513: I do understand
23/11/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: I can understand Joshua
23/11/23, 11:00 am - +27 74 243 3513: 👏
23/11/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is an undergraduate Medical Lab Technology program which is a 3 years course. Medical Laboratory Technology program also called Clinical laboratory science is an allied health profession that is concerned with the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of disease through the use of clinical laboratory tests. During the program these tests help candidates to learn and diagnose, detect and treat diseases. Additionally the program deals with the collecting of information's sampling, reporting, testing and documentation.


Such graduates are hired in capacities such as Laboratory Technician, Laboratory Manager, Medical Officer, Research Associate, Medical Record Technician, Resident Medical Officer, Lab Assistant, Laboratory Testing Manager, Associate Professor/Lecturer etc.

Medical technicians can get job opportunities in places such as hospitals, health care clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists’ offices, etc.
23/11/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: *A Bachelor in Medical Laboratory Technology student could work in the field of forensic medicine as a forensic laboratory technician, performing tasks such as analyzing samples and testing specimens to assist in criminal investigations and trials. However, they may need to obtain additional training and certification specific to forensic science. Additionally, the specific job responsibilities and requirements may vary depending on the laboratory and jurisdiction.*
23/11/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

A Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology prepares individuals to work in medical laboratories, where they perform a variety of tests to analyze biological samples and support the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Graduates with this degree can pursue careers in the healthcare and medical field, including:

Medical Laboratory Technologist
Medical Laboratory Technician

In these roles, individuals with a Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology may be involved in performing laboratory tests to detect the presence of diseases, analyzing and interpreting test results, and working with healthcare professionals to develop and implement effective treatments. These professionals play a critical role in supporting the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, and their work is essential to the effective functioning of healthcare organizations.
23/11/23, 11:03 am - +27 74 243 3513: Well detailed explanation and I do understand 👏
23/11/23, 11:04 am - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you 👏it's a nice program to do👏
23/11/23, 11:04 am - +27 74 243 3513: 👏✅
23/11/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Joshua.
23/11/23, 11:05 am - Harmehak: In simple words Joshua, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
23/11/23, 11:08 am - +27 74 243 3513: I do understand. It's affordable since i will be earning 1000usd per year through EWYL program also 👏
23/11/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: I understand, Joshua!
23/11/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 11:20 am - +27 74 243 3513: Will said 👏
23/11/23, 11:20 am - +27 74 243 3513: I do understand it, thank you 👏
23/11/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

23/11/23, 11:26 am - +27 74 243 3513: Noted all in advance ✅
23/11/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 11:37 am - +27 74 243 3513: I do understand and am thankful 👏👏.. It's a nice program to use as a student in India
23/11/23, 11:39 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

Kindly, can i do Bachelors degree in Physiotherapy then i will manage to have many tasks to cover my tuition fee. Am kindly, humbly asking for your assistance. I promise, I will work hard. Doing Physiotherapy will open many opportunities in my home country for employment creation as compared to medical laboratory technology in our country please 👏
23/11/23, 11:47 am - +27 74 243 3513: That's great news to hear👏
23/11/23, 11:50 am - +27 74 243 3513: I was thinking, i can not do many tasks per day or a time. Can you please help me in doing Bachelors degree in Physiotherapy 👏
23/11/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: While I completely understand what you are sharing Joshua!

That would be completely your choice please.

Since 90% of the students usually choose Bachelor of science in Medical laboratory Technology itself!

You can take you take your time and make an informed decision.
23/11/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: The information can be overwhelming at times, it's best if you make a thorough decision after a proper discussion with your family.
23/11/23, 11:57 am - +27 74 243 3513: As much we research as a family and my own dreams, can you assist me in doing Bachelors degree in Physiotherapy please. I will be a dedicated and responsible student when am given tasks and I will make sure I will be the best student as an Edoofian 👏
23/11/23, 11:58 am - +27 74 243 3513: Yes, we already discussed of it yesterday and they are also happy and proud of it. Can you assist me please 👏. I do need your help
23/11/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: You can opt for the same Joshua, 

Be informed that the costs are between $2000-3000 itself.
23/11/23, 12:02 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Meaning to say it will be a 50% scholarship if i will take Bachelors degree in Physiotherapy?.
23/11/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, considering your results you would be eligible for the same itself.
23/11/23, 12:04 pm - +27 74 243 3513: I do understand. Through many tasks i will manage. I do believe and i can not lose this opportunity 👏
23/11/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 12:09 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Yes i will be ready 👏
23/11/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Joshua, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/11/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 12:11 pm - +27 74 243 3513: 1500usd - 2250usd
23/11/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/11/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: You see Joshua, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 12:16 pm - +27 74 243 3513: I do understand, so i will have to pay 750usd application fee and Enrolment fee 350usd
23/11/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: No please, only $350 fee which includes all this.
23/11/23, 12:21 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Okh i do understand now. So application fee, enrollment fee, visa assistance etc, will be included all in 350usd. It's really affordable Edoofa
23/11/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/11/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 12:29 pm - +27 74 243 3513: I do understand. There is 1 point am not getting clear. Are you saying application fee is 350usd. Then I will need to pay after again 350usd Enrolment fee after acceptance. Or both application fee and Enrolment fee cost 350usd once.
23/11/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: The terms are usually used interchangeably please.

It's one fee of $350 which is paid is parts after you are accepted into the program.
23/11/23, 12:31 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Okh, now I do understand.
23/11/23, 12:33 pm - +27 74 243 3513: So can i do if you have much information about my eligibility scholarship percentage for my program or i will be given my percentage after interview and acceptance from University 👏. I just need to know as am nearby to be an Edoofian and am willing to be in India 👏
23/11/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate Joshua!

You would be going through the entire proces.

And we look forward to you joining our student community.
23/11/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/11/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/11/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/11/23, 12:37 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you so much, I get it 100%.I really appreciate your patience and being kind please 👏
23/11/23, 12:39 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you, i get everything clear now. Thank you for your time and support 👏
23/11/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/11/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/11/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
23/11/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 12:44 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Am so happy and motivated in seeing these kinds of motivational quotes you are giving me please👏. I am thankful to meet someone who is kind like you 👏
23/11/23, 12:44 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Wow that's great 👏🔥.
23/11/23, 12:45 pm - +27 74 243 3513: I get it 👏
23/11/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/11/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 12:49 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you for sharing Ms Harmehak 👏. Am really happy today. It's like someone who is already in India as an Edoofian 👏
23/11/23, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Joshua.
23/11/23, 12:51 pm - +27 74 243 3513: 👏. Let me connect with her
23/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

23/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
23/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 12:30 PM CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2.

24/11/23, 12:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
24/11/23, 12:13 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Good evening Mr Sahil.

Yes we can proceed with the eligibility check evaluation 👏
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
24/11/23, 1:20 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Yes sir, I was well groomed and adviced very nice and kindly and i remained with no queries as she tell me all she knew about Edoofa and how it works 👏
24/11/23, 2:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Yes, i was connected to Mrs Ruth yesterday and she told me everything about how she is managing everything as a small scale farmer and i told this all to my parents and they were also motivated and intrested with the program. And as they were also following all the messages, pictures and videos which were send by Ms Sahil, they also encouraged and motivated me to be like other dedicated students who are able to make even more scholarships credits and as they know me very well, they said it's very important for you to be part of this program as an Edoofian student studying Bachelors degree in Medical Laboratory Technology. We are all ready to be part of this scholarship program 👏
24/11/23, 2:33 pm - +27 74 243 3513: I have always been interested in the medical field as i was also motivated by Ms Harmehak. I decided that I wanted to be a medical technologist so that I could help people in a more direct way. I enjoy working with people and collaborating with other healthcare professionals. I also like the idea of being able to work in a laboratory and conduct research to help improve patient care. Truly speaking, the story of Mrs Ruth have motivated my parents as they also value much education 👏
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Mistakenly written, i mean pictures, messages and videos which were send by Ms Harmehak 👏

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship.

1. Bachelor science in Medical Laboratory Technology.

2. India

3. Average cost of studying in India without scholarship is around 4000usd to 6000usd.

4. I will be paying 2000usd-3000usd accordingly to the University tuition fee per my Bachelors degree in Medical Laboratory Technology. Depending on the amount of scholarship i will be awarded if i be found eligible for the 100% scholarship, I will be a dedicated and responsible who will do EWYL tasks and paying 1200usd or more using those scholarship credits and i promise to excel far so i will cover up my tuition fee as an unprevileged student who comes from a financially  disadvantaged background.

5. The enrollment fee is 350usd.

6. Within 7 days i will pay my enrollment fee👏.

7. Yes, it's clear to us and we will do as instructed 👏.
24/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
24/11/23, 3:47 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Yes, they are and from the starting day of this group, all of them were following up the messages, pictures and videos. They are happy and  grateful of the process 👏
24/11/23, 4:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can they acknowledge the same in this group using voice notes ?
24/11/23, 4:43 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Okh thank, let me inform them and they will send their own voice notes 👏

24/11/23, 5:48 pm - +27 65 268 5173: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 5:54 pm - +27 74 243 3513: They were trying to elaborate everything but using our home language they do understand about EWYL program which increases scholarship credits, how Edoofa works and all motivational advices and skills which were said in the group and they are all proud of me in doing Bachelors degree in Medical Laboratory Technology in India. It's their day dreaming for me to be a Medical lab Scientist 👏 Thank you
24/11/23, 8:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
24/11/23, 8:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email (mthombenijoshua79@gmail.com) and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
30/11/23, 9:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 7:04 am - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you 👏🤲, we really appreciate this as a family. Edoofa came to rescue this year. We are all happy 👏

Can we know exactly the percentage of scholarship i was offered because as i go through i just see it's like 60% to 100% and it's not clearly illustrated that i get 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% so we will do our budget accordingly to the percentage offered from Edoofa.
01/12/23, 12:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?

01/12/23, 1:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you read the cost ?
01/12/23, 1:40 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Yes, it's 1200usd to 1800usd. Is this cost after getting scholarship or it's just the cost of my program from various universities in India. I just it to be clear. Am not getting the point well of saying 60 to 100%. Can you make it clear.
01/12/23, 2:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Dear Joshua,

I appreciate your inquiry. Upon careful examination of your acceptance letter, you'll find that the cost mentioned refers to the remaining portion after the scholarship is applied, which ranges from $1200 to $1800.

I want to clarify that the scholarship percentage indicated in the letter is a range from 90% to 100%, which is generally reserved for students with 15 points or more. However, due to your counselor, Ms. Harmehak, speaking highly of you and your commendable performance, I recommended your application for a higher quantum of scholarship.

Therefore, the adjusted cost for you falls within the range of $1200 to $1800, even though you initially had 9 points. This adjustment was made to acknowledge your academic excellence and unique circumstances.
01/12/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The scholarship percentage indicated in the acceptance letter is a range from 60% to 100%, This means the awarded scholarship falls within this range .
01/12/23, 2:32 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you, i do understand. Does this 1200usd to 1800usd covered tuition fee, accommodation and food or it's only for tuition fee and accommodation? 👏
01/12/23, 2:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: It cover food accommodation and remaining tuition fees if any .
01/12/23, 2:35 pm - +27 74 243 3513: Thank you 👏. I do understand.
01/12/23, 3:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Any other questions you have ?
