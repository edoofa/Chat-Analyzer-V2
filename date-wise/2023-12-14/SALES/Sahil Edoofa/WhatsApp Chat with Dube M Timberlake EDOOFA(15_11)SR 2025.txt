18/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 669 5111: The analysis you gave me proves that India is a well developed country in Technology for instance the the CEOs for Adobe , Alphabet Inc and Microsoft are indians ..

18/11/23, 6:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Amazing
 
As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
18/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 669 5111: No am not sir
18/11/23, 6:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: -**let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

18/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 669 5111: I think my mother might try to manage the remaining fee .
18/11/23, 7:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That's great to know. Now, let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
18/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 669 5111: No l don't.
18/11/23, 7:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/11/23, 7:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/11/23, 7:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -

18/11/23, 7:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting your child?
18/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 71 920 0316: Yes, l think it will be of great benefit.
18/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 71 920 0316: This helps children to have job opportunities after the completion of their courses since at times  people fail to have jobs even after attending tertiary education.
My child will have an upper hand in making sense out  of learning  and producing better in life.
All l wish is a great and brighter future for my child.  Thank you sir
19/11/23, 8:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let us reconvene for our session tomorrow at 11:30 PM CAT time with a fresh and focused mindset to continue our discussion. Your active participation in the session is an important parameter for evaluating your application.

As Psalm 119:105 says, 'Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.' Similarly, let our conversation illuminate the path to your educational journey.

For now, feel free to visit www.edoofa.com to explore more about the opportunities awaiting you.
19/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Good evening sir.
Noted .
Thank you.
20/11/23, 12:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Afternoon, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Good Afternoon sir ,
Yes we may
20/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How are you doing today ?
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now , if I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Now you see , the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is *consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects* is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

20/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 920 0316: We are blessed sir thank you
20/11/23, 5:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
20/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 920 0316: Number4
20/11/23, 6:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now let me brief you on another benefit of the Edoofa Program.
As you know through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. But did you know that here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees as well.
 
Would you like me to explain how that happens?
20/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 920 0316: Yes sir.. Thank you
20/11/23, 6:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright so can you tell me what is the first thing you would be supposed to do when you wish to apply for a university
 
You buy an application form by paying the application fee, isn't it?
20/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 71 920 0316: Yes it's true
20/11/23, 8:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you know how much the application fee is for an international student for any college on your own?
20/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 920 0316: No I don't know sir
20/11/23, 9:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well,if you research you will find that on an average Application Fee of a University is around $150-$200.So if you want to apply for 5 different colleges, you will have to pay the application fee for each college differently.So how much will the total expense be on just the application fee?
20/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 920 0316: It will be so much
20/11/23, 9:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: it would be around $750-$1000 but even if you apply to 5 colleges after paying the application fee, do they provide you any assurance whether you will be given admission or scholarship?
20/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 920 0316: It's so much
20/11/23, 9:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
 
But the real challenge is to get eligible. Do you think you are capable of this challenge?
20/11/23, 9:58 pm - +263 71 920 0316: We may try
20/11/23, 9:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same.
Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
20/11/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 920 0316: May you kindly help me
20/11/23, 10:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.

 
This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!
 
So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it.
Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
20/11/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 920 0316: Yes sir
20/11/23, 10:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 10:33 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Noted sir
20/11/23, 10:33 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Thank you
21/11/23, 11:55 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
21/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Afternoon sir..
Yes we may
21/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 920 0316: Yes sir good afternoon sir
21/11/23, 2:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
 How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
21/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 920 0316: 750-1000
21/11/23, 3:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000. 

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

22/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 669 5111: Good Morning sir 
Noted.
22/11/23, 11:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
22/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 669 5111: I am doing great and you?
22/11/23, 3:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
22/11/23, 11:05 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Ok sir

23/11/23, 11:57 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

23/11/23, 7:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: so now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
23/11/23, 10:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>

When the results are out and the Student has met the Edoofa requirements admission is continued if not there are refunded .

How are you doing today ?
29/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Good afternoon sir ..
How are you
29/11/23, 2:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
29/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Noted sir
29/11/23, 7:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: .
29/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Good evening

29/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 669 5111: I think Stage 1
29/11/23, 7:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
29/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Yes sir..
30/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Good afternoon sir
30/11/23, 2:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
30/11/23, 2:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
30/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Yes sir

01/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Yes sir
01/12/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your child’s counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
01/12/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

06/12/23, 11:14 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
07/12/23, 11:37 am - Sahil Edoofa: May I know what challenges are you facing so that I can help you?
08/12/23, 11:49 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
I have observed that you have seen my messages but not responded .

May I know what challenges are you facing?
08/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Good afternoon sir..
Everything is ok sir just that my mom is at a funeral and she is pretty occupied..
08/12/23, 4:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
08/12/23, 4:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
08/12/23, 4:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
08/12/23, 4:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 4:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023 for $200 and the 14th  or 15th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
08/12/23, 5:43 pm - +263 78 669 5111: Ok sir
08/12/23, 6:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
