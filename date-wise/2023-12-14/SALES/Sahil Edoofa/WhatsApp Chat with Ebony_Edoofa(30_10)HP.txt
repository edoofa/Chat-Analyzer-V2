04/11/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 437 9761: Ready
04/11/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: That's great please.

So what motivates him to venture in medicine?
04/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 437 9761: He just grew with the ambition to become a Doctor.So from form 1 he did Sciences as his main subjects
04/11/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

So why didn't he pursue Physics instead of Computers in his A level please?
04/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 437 9761: Computers he did that at his own will 
Actually we wanted him to take those 3,
04/11/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
04/11/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
04/11/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 437 9761: So if it happens like he passes well from his combination
Hw will jus go for engineering
04/11/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Physics is required for engineering.
04/11/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

06/11/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed by now please?
06/11/23, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected?
06/11/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Yes connected now
06/11/23, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
06/11/23, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: Have you been able to go through the shared information and resources?
06/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Yes 
I am assured now that Edoofa is something good
06/11/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, please!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
06/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 437 9761: My familiar are not familiar with it
Its our first time hearing about it,thats why we had so many doubts at first
We thought it was a scam
06/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, I completely understand your concerns as a parent.

Be rest assured, you would be proceeding once you are fully assured and satisfied.

I would be connecting you with a parent too <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 437 9761: So our ranges are 2000 to 3000 and it remains unchanged for how long?
06/11/23, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: The entire degree please.
06/11/23, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
06/11/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Ok I have understood,
06/11/23, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same please?
06/11/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 437 9761: I'm interested and liking it much.Praying that we will grab the opportunity
06/11/23, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words and we look forward to the same as well.

Now let me brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would assist you.
06/11/23, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/11/23, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 437 9761: So this is not compulsory?
06/11/23, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: No please,

It's a choice, however we do encourage our students for the same as it helps them earn credits which eventually reduces their fee as well as help them learn skills required for today's job world.
06/11/23, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
06/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Thats Ok 
Its good
06/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please
06/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

06/11/23, 6:21 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job! <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: This is exactly what we aim at and prepare them for through the Earn While You Learn Program.
06/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Ok
Thats wonderful
We are learning a lot
06/11/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to have you thoroughly following.
06/11/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/11/23, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Yes I'm following,
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. We would conclude the session in 15 minutes itself.
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: You see, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Around 2000-2500us
06/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Yaaa its very possible and uts happening
06/11/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words
06/11/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/11/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
06/11/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Thats very fair,regardless of the fact that as civil servants we earn $200 per mnth 
I think we shld start saving now
06/11/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: It's great to see your commitment please.
06/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
06/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Im still learning and going through everything
06/11/23, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: You can surely take your time to go through everything again as well please.
06/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
06/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
06/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

06/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Ok waiting
06/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 437 9761: Thanks much
06/11/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
06/11/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Right here in her contact please.
06/11/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
06/11/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/11/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

How are you doing today?

08/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 979 3491: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
08/12/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
08/12/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
08/12/23, 2:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 2:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023 for $200 and the 14th  or 15th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
08/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 979 3491: We are following, sir. So does that mean that he's been "found eligible" for the program or you'll notify that to us after the payments , and how do we make the payments. Please brief it up
08/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 979 3491: Or he is proceeding to step two?
08/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 675 5579: We are all fine sir
08/12/23, 5:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
08/12/23, 9:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so let us connect at 10:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session
