Computer science
07/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Duly noted.
07/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
07/12/23, 10:56 am - +27 78 040 2691: Definitely i am

07/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Mr Michael,

However did you happen to find the information interesting and helpful?
07/12/23, 12:07 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Very helpful
07/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
07/12/23, 12:37 pm - +27 78 040 2691: It is very expensive from my own research
07/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please.
07/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/12/23, 12:42 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Well understood
07/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 12:55 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Very true
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
07/12/23, 1:13 pm - +27 78 040 2691: That makes a very big difference in actual fact it will be very reasonable  and it will actually assist us
07/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
07/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
07/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
07/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

07/12/23, 1:44 pm - +27 78 040 2691: I have gone through it its a very good option that you have in place
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate the same, Mr Michael
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/12/23, 2:05 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Understood
07/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

So Mr Michael now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
07/12/23, 2:43 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Yes
07/12/23, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: Michael, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
07/12/23, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/12/23, 2:48 pm - +27 78 040 2691: $2250
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Delvin, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Yes
07/12/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/12/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
07/12/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/12/23, 3:55 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Understood
07/12/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
07/12/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
07/12/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
07/12/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
07/12/23, 4:03 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Well understood
07/12/23, 4:12 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
07/12/23, 4:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 4:13 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Ok
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 4:44 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Ok
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: Were you able to connect with Mrs Ruth please?
07/12/23, 5:12 pm - +27 78 040 2691: She is currently offline will keep trying
07/12/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

However you can rather call her directly, Mr Michael.
07/12/23, 5:21 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Ok will do so
07/12/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
07/12/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
07/12/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

07/12/23, 5:42 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Thank you
08/12/23, 10:23 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Mr Michael, Mrs Ruth and Delvin, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
08/12/23, 10:31 am - +27 78 040 2691: Hood morning yes we are good to proceed
08/12/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

May I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?
08/12/23, 10:39 am - +27 78 040 2691: We did discuss the first stage of the process and at the moment no question
08/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: I am glad you all had a thorough discussion.

Mr Michael, are you aware that we are proudly associated with Advent Hope Academy since years and we do have students currently in India from Advent hope as well?
08/12/23, 10:42 am - +27 78 040 2691: I was not aware thats good news then
08/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Its great that you believe it was of help!
08/12/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth?

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding.

Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
08/12/23, 10:49 am - +27 78 040 2691: Yes i had a discussion with her yesterday
08/12/23, 10:50 am - +27 78 040 2691: She explained the process

08/12/23, 10:59 am - +27 78 040 2691: Great news
08/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Yes please
08/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
08/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 11:06 am - +27 78 040 2691: I have watched it
08/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: So are you willing to support Delvin to be a part of next year's Africa Visit, Mr Michael?
08/12/23, 11:07 am - +27 78 040 2691: Definitely
08/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: It's great to see your support, Mr Michael.
08/12/23, 11:14 am - +27 78 040 2691: You welcome
08/12/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
08/12/23, 11:35 am - +27 78 040 2691: 1.Bachelor of business adminstration

2. Zimbabwe

3. $6000-$8000

4.$3000

5.$350

6.7 days

7.Yes i am clear
08/12/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Mr. Michael, What is the country finalized for your child's higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship?
08/12/23, 11:36 am - +27 78 040 2691: India
08/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Very correct!

So far do you have any queries for me?
08/12/23, 11:37 am - +27 78 040 2691: No
08/12/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
08/12/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
08/12/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
08/12/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023 for $200 and the  14th  or 15th of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
08/12/23, 12:03 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Option 1
08/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: In that case Mr Michael, shall I share the video call slots with the Program Director for today?
08/12/23, 12:05 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Yes
08/12/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: The available slot for today is at 1:30 PM CAT,

Shall I reserve the same for you?
08/12/23, 12:07 pm - +27 78 040 2691: Yes
08/12/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Mr Michael, call has been scheduled for *1:30 PM CAT, today*. Please set an alarm to ensure you're available at least 10 minutes before the call. Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck!

Additionally, we'll be sharing a letter from our Honorable Director, Mr. Abhinav Gupta, with parents before the interview. Please make sure to go through the document, and as parents, acknowledge it using a voice note.
