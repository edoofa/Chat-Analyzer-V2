You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.

24/11/23, 10:20 am - +263 78 187 5799: Mrs Harmehak can you please clarify  on fees for each programme,.
24/11/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: I would be discussing the same once we have finalized Audrey's course please.

From what we have discussed so far are there any queries from that please?
24/11/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Audrey you mentioned your mother's name as Mrs Sheron Haluwizia Mahaso.

However while introducing your mother and aunt you mentioned Mrs Njiri and Mrs Chikande,

Can either of you help me understand better please?

24/11/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: So are you, Mrs Njiri and Mrs Sheron as parents and guardians willing to support Audrey's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?
24/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 187 5799: Well, my maiden name is Wadzanai Diza .My husband 'name is Njiri , so I'm Mrs Njiri .Audrey is my brothers daughter but unfortunately my brother was involved in an accident some years back. Sharon Haluwizia is Audrey's mother, Sharon is now called Mrs Chikande.I think it's clear now kkkk
24/11/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Yes please, Mrs Njiri.

I appreciate your efforts too.
24/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 187 5799: Yes we are Audrey's parents and guardians that's why I was  asking you about the fees.
24/11/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Yes please, I do understand.
24/11/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
24/11/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 187 5799: Iam following
24/11/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
24/11/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Okay Audrey, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
24/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 015 6726: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 015 6726: A level subjects l am studying are:

Mathematics 
Biology 
Chemistry
24/11/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Well received, Audrey.

What motivates you to study Medicine?
24/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 015 6726: The desire to help others, a passion for science and biology and l could have an opportunity to make a difference in the world and improve people's lives
24/11/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Oh alright, it's great to see you have a kind heart and you wish to bring a change.

Did you happen to research about the requirements to study Medicine, Audrey?

If so, why didn't you pursue Physics, I believe it's a crucial science subject, isn't it?
24/11/23, 11:39 am - +263 78 015 6726: No l didnt research more about it
24/11/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
24/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 015 6726: okay now l have understood this. thank you
24/11/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*

By immersing myself in a different culture and learning from new perspectives, I believe that I will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the world around me. Additionally, I hope to build connections with people from all over the world, which could lead to future opportunities.
24/11/23, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Audrey, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure

24/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 015 6726: This is Great
24/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 015 6726: True Fact✅
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Audrey

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 015 6726: That's a great question! And yes, I'm aware that the cost of higher education in India is significantly lower than in other countries, even without scholarships. For example, the cost of tuition and living expenses for an international student studying in India can be up to 70% lower than in the United States or Europe. This makes India an attractive destination for students who want to pursue a quality education without breaking the bank.
24/11/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: I can see you did your thorough researches, Audrey.
24/11/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 015 6726: okay
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/11/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 015 6726: Noted✅
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Audrey, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
24/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 015 6726: This makes education affordable for all
24/11/23, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!

So far are there any queries please?
24/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 015 6726: I don't have any queries Ms Harmehak
24/11/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
24/11/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: Audrey, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
24/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 015 6726: yes you are right
24/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 015 6726: Ms Harmehak l agree with you on this
24/11/23, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
24/11/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, so now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
24/11/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 015 6726: yes Ms Harmehak
24/11/23, 11:09 pm - +263 78 015 6726: It's great to hear from you too! And thanks for the advance notice of our session tomorrow. I'll make sure to prepare for it And thanks again for your time and effort! I really appreciate it.
25/11/23, 9:12 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
25/11/23, 9:12 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Audrey
25/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 015 6726: yes we can start
25/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 015 6726: Good morning
25/11/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
25/11/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
25/11/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
25/11/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

25/11/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 015 6726: This is great
25/11/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
25/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 015 6726: Wow, that sounds like a really valuable and comprehensive program and it's great that students are being given the opportunity to develop these skills while they're still in school.
25/11/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Very correct, Audrey!
25/11/23, 11:55 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

25/11/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 015 6726: This is great
25/11/23, 11:58 am - Harmehak: That is great,

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
25/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 015 6726: ok
25/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 015 6726: yes I am ready
25/11/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Audrey, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
25/11/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
25/11/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 015 6726: Okay
25/11/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Please?
25/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 015 6726: This message was deleted
25/11/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Why did you delete please? <This message was edited>
25/11/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
25/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 015 6726: $1500 to $2250
25/11/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
25/11/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
25/11/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Audrey, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
25/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 015 6726: it was deleted by mistake
25/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 015 6726: Yes, this is it
25/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 015 6726: yes Ms Harmehak
25/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
25/11/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
25/11/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
25/11/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
25/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 015 6726: "The COVID-19 pandemic has indeed caused difficulties for many people around the world, and it's great to hear that your program is taking steps to help alleviate some of those difficulties.
25/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 015 6726: Thank you
25/11/23, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we do understand the same.
25/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 015 6726: "I really appreciate how the program is taking into account the different financial situations of its students and their families. It's a very considerate policy that shows the program's commitment to helping students succeed, regardless of their circumstances.
25/11/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Audrey.

It's good to have you acknowledge the same.
25/11/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
25/11/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
25/11/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
25/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 015 6726: Thank you Ms Harmehak
25/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 015 6726: Yes l have understood the process.
25/11/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
25/11/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
25/11/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

25/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 015 6726: It's very inspiring.
25/11/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
25/11/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

25/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 015 6726: "Wow, it's so exciting to see a real-life example of someone who was able to secure a visa and come to India to study!
