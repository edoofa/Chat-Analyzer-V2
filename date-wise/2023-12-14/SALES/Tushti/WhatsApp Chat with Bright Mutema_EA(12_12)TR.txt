*I am Ms Tushti, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

13/12/23, 6:21 am - +263 77 302 5192: I will respond to you tomorrow at 9.30 am because I am attending a funeral today
13/12/23, 9:48 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
13/12/23, 5:20 pm - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
