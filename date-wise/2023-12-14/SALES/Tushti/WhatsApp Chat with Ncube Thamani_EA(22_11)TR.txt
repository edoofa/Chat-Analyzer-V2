13/12/23, 1:49 pm - Tushti: What are your thoughts on India now?
13/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 646 0816: It's the best country to go and study since it's the fastest growing country
13/12/23, 1:55 pm - Tushti: Amazing, as I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
13/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 646 0816: No we're not familiar with the cost
13/12/23, 2:03 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
13/12/23, 2:03 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/12/23, 2:03 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

13/12/23, 2:03 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/12/23, 2:03 pm - Tushti: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
13/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 646 0816: I understand
13/12/23, 2:10 pm - Tushti: Do the parents have any questions regarding the cost?
