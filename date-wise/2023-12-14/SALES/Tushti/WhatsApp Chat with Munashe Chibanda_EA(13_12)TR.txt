I am 17 years old currently preparing for  upper six in 2024 at Lady Enarater International high school which is located in Mashonaland Central, Zimbabwe.Lady Enarater high school is a reliable International private school which is paid USD 1300 per term. I am doing science subjects which are  maths,chemistry and biology because I believe that I am going to be a successful neurosurgeon in the next few years to come ,why? because i know there are lot of people out there who have debilitating conditions in our country and there are a few neurosurgeon who can help them so I believe I will be at help too if I was to add the number of neurosurgeon in our country and would gladly would be at help if i am to become International too. 
For my strengths ,my leadership skills are quite breathe taking says spectators' feedback because currently am a leader at Lady Enarater International high school, teamwork too,problem solving and communication too can count as I am seeing myself being a therapist and a neurosurgeon too.
As for my weaknesses ,one of them is being a highly sensitive person as I sometimes consider other people 's emotions rather than mine.
i am into music and reading a lot of books during my free time.
As I mentioned above ,I am the first born child in a family of two children, where the last born is a 11 year old boy at primary level right now preparing for his final year at primary level.My father and mother have been financially supporting my education ever since I stepped my way in kindergarten and they will  continue to do so until I'm in my graduation gown,but I also have plans in supporting them too as time goes by.My father is a pharmacy sales representative and my mother is a hair dresser who  Try their best everyday for our wellbeing.

Thank you
