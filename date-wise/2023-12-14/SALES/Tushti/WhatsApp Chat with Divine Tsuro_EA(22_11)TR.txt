23/11/23, 10:49 am - Tushti: It is a pleasure to connect with you today,

You can address me as Ms. Tushti and we do have Mr Shubham the Senior Academician & Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

Also do note that my working hours are *9:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.
23/11/23, 10:49 am - Tushti: Now, before beginning the session, I'd like to know if you have any knowledge about the Edoofa Scholarship Program, and what motivated you to apply?
23/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 293 5887: Not much information. But we got to know it through one of our neighbours who have a daughter recently got a scholarship through Edoofa
23/11/23, 10:51 am - Tushti: Oh, that's wonderful!
23/11/23, 10:52 am - Tushti: What's her name? And what did you learn from them about Edoofa?
23/11/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 293 5887: She is called Tariro Madhara. We got to know that Edoofa provides scholarships to talented students from poor backgrounds
23/11/23, 11:07 am - Tushti: I see!
23/11/23, 11:07 am - Tushti: Adding to your knowledge you see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 11:07 am - Tushti: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. United College of Education, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected Sir Adam Luthuli has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/11/23, 11:07 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 293 5887: Sure it would be a great opportunity

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
13/12/23, 5:15 pm - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
