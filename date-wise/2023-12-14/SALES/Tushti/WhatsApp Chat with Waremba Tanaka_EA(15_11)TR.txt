22/11/23, 4:14 pm - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
23/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 293 3961: Well l go by the name Tanaka Waremba  ,a boy aged 17 who lives in Harare Zimbabwe. I'm a lower 6 student at Seke 1 high School in Harare Chitungwiza. I'm studying Mathematics,   Accounting and Economics. Well some people continue saying l am a good adviser and a listener and another thing l hate about myself is that I'm too emotional even if l fail or l couldn't archive my aim l easily cry but there's one thing l like about myself l keep on moving l don't give up easily. 

Well l would like to specialize with Accounting because from my own vision l think that's a reliable job to specialize with since finance is now becoming the foundation of everything in most countries. My mother is self employed while my father is a bus driver .My mother and father ended at O level. I have got four siblings two girls and two boys ,the other two are in grade 2 and grade 6 and the other two are still young .My mother and father are the one's who are financially supporting me so far and also they will be the one's who will support my higher education abroad. My per term fee is $70.
I think that's all
