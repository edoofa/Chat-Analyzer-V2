My father is a primary teacher and my mother in not employed. My father has got a Diploma in teaching. Father has been supporting my education and he is going to support me during my higher education abroad. My per term school fees was $96. The school is called Ngundu Halt Secondary School and it is in Masvingo Province. I have no favourite hobby but most of the time l play chess but l take it as a sport . I have got 5 siblings, the elder one is doing her degree at University of Zimbabwe, the second is a student at Bondolfi teachers college and l am the third born. The forth one has just finished her Ordinary level this year and the last is looking for an enrollment for secondary school as he has just finished her primary level.
