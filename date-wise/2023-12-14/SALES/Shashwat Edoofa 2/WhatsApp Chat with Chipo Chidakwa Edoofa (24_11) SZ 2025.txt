On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
07/12/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 883 1153: Yes
07/12/23, 9:04 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Chipo!
07/12/23, 9:04 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Chipo, could you please share why you didn't pursue Physics in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
07/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 71 883 1153: l did not persue physics because l know if you want to do medicine you should do chemistry ,,,yes if you do physics you can also do medicine but l think Chemistry is more appropriate and also the other reason being l wasn't  doing physics during my  O level
07/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 71 883 1153: Yes physics is very crucial but l enjoy chemistry more
07/12/23, 11:44 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
07/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 883 1153: Okay but l do have chemisrty ,biology and mathematics as for physics l didn't  know that its mandatory for medical studies moreover here in Zimbabwe if you want to do medicine they offer you maths,chemistry and biology only physics as you also mentioned is given to someone who wants to do engineering
07/12/23, 2:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Chipo. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with your A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
07/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 883 1153: Sure
07/12/23, 2:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that you could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
07/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 883 1153: Bachelor of science in physiotherapy
07/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 883 1153: But can l ask why is physics needed for medical studies
07/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 883 1153: Also with my subjects can't  l be a dematologist or a surgeon doctor
07/12/23, 3:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I want to emphasize that the eligibility criteria for studying Medicine, encompassing subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, are globally standardized. These criteria are not set by Edoofa but are established by regulatory bodies and governments worldwide. The objective is to ensure a foundational understanding of the sciences before embarking on a medical degree. The government mandates these prerequisites for admission to medical courses.
07/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 883 1153: Okay
07/12/23, 3:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know which course intrigues you the most, please?

12/12/23, 5:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mrs. Tambudzai! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation

12/12/23, 5:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
12/12/23, 5:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
12/12/23, 7:33 pm - +27 83 340 8456: As it is for now l can't afford but maybe God is gonna open more doors for me so that l can be able to pay
12/12/23, 7:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
12/12/23, 7:42 pm - +27 83 340 8456: I was talking to my brother now, he said he will help me with the money whenever I'm short
12/12/23, 7:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have discussed the prospects of *Edoofa Scholarship Program* with your Brother, please?
12/12/23, 8:05 pm - +27 83 340 8456: We are still discussing
12/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Tambudzai. May I know how can I be of assistance, please?
