My name is *James Magombedze*  and I was born on 08 June 2000 at Musiso (St Anthony) Hospital.
I am a firstborn son of *Joice Hasani* and *Andrew Magombedze.* Both of my parents are peasant farmer.

My parents have seven children and I'm the firstborn. As a family we depend on peasant (small scale) farming for survival.

 *About my education:* 

I did my primary level at Judea Primary School and my Ordinary Level at *Hippo Valley Secondary School.* 2017 is the exact year I sat for my Ordinary Level Exams and I came out with 8 out of 9 Subjects which graded C and better, including *English and Science* but without Mathematics. 
    Due to financial instability in my family, I failed to start my Advanced Level Course in 2018. After working in sugarcane fields I succeeded to start my Advanced Level Course in February 2019 at *Matara Christian Secondary School*  . In *November 2020* I sat for my Advanced Level Exams . My results are as follows: Literature in English *C* , Sociology *B* , History *C* , Family and Religious Studies *A* . I did Arts Studies *(Lit in English* , *Sociology* , *Family and Religious Studies* and *History* ) at my Advanced Level.
 
It was my wish and is still to continue with my education upto University but due to financial breakdown in my family I failed to do so. I tried to work in dangerous mines but nothing yielded.
12/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 351 7754: Fortunately, there's someone who commiserated with me on my situation and told me about Edoofa. He urged me to apply for a scholarship. That's what I really did and I have a great hope that with you my dream will come true!
12/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 351 7754: *About my favorite hobbies and interests:*

*Reading, writing and singing music 

 *My ambition*

As a young man who loves a society *which is shaped with justice,* my dream is to study and work in *legal field.*

12/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 351 7754: Alright Sir, thank you!

Both of my parents do not have any certificate of education so they are self employed. To take care of the family they depend on peasant farming. They just have a small piece of land in Chiredzi rural area which they cultivate and sell the produce for my young brothers to go to school.
12/12/23, 10:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your parents' dedication to taking care of the family through peasant farming speaks volumes about their resilience and commitment. Despite the challenges, they make the most of their resources, cultivating a small piece of land in Chiredzi rural area to provide for the family and ensure your younger brothers can attend school! So, could you kindly tell me how much *Matara High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education?
12/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 351 7754: Yeah, in 2019 to 2020 when I did my Advanced Level, school fees at Matara High School was equivalent to US $25. 
    At the first term I payed school fees and for myself but later on my School headmaster, Mr Allen Raisi assisted me. My father also payed for me but not always.

12/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 351 7754: I tried to seek a financial help from different relatives but I found no one. There's only one uncle who promised to help me but not in everything
