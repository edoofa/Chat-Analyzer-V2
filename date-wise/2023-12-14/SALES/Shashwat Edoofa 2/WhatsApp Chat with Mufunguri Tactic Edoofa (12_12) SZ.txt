Your hands-on experience and proficiency in vehicle mechanics undoubtedly lay a solid foundation for your journey into the broader realm of mechanical engineering. Your pursuit not only showcases your passion for the field but also positions you as a valuable asset in the ever-evolving landscape of engineering, Mr. Lawson! It's truly commendable that Mrs. Enety serves in the Ministry of Justice. Working in such a crucial institution requires dedication, integrity, and a commitment to upholding the principles of justice. Her role undoubtedly contributes significantly to the functioning of the legal system, ensuring fairness and adherence to the law. Her service reflects a profound sense of responsibility and a desire to contribute to the betterment of society through the administration of justice!
13/12/23, 5:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It's truly impressive to note that Tactic possesses a sharp intellect and a strong willingness to learn.

Total - 10 points.
13/12/23, 6:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! That information will suffice for now but I believe you will be sending the documents as well.
13/12/23, 6:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tactic! Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
13/12/23, 6:43 pm - +263 71 137 9564: Certainly
13/12/23, 6:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I will be waiting for your response.
13/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 71 137 9564: I am highly captivated  by the medical field ( with clinical specialisation being surgery) because it is a vastly evolving and complex field, specifically in terms of technology, and it provides me a platform to serve people.
What initially sparked my interest for this specific field is the urge to serve people (the great meaning to life), the medical field will also allow me to grow personality wise in terms of understanding, care giving and sense of responsibility.
13/12/23, 6:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew you towards that peculiar domain, please?
13/12/23, 7:06 pm - +263 71 137 9564: I always found myself drawn to the clinical specialisation of surgery because it involves direct treatment of patients and I would also admire the specialist as I saw them in action on  television programs.
13/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Tactic, could you please share why you didn't pursue Biology in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial Medical subject, isn't it?
13/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 71 137 9564: Yes it is a crucial subject indeed, but I believe I didn't have the appropriate foundation of the subject because I would gravitate towards Physics the most as compared to Biology.
13/12/23, 7:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics, Chemsitry, and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
13/12/23, 7:27 pm - +263 71 137 9564: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 7:31 pm - +263 71 137 9564: So if my Advanced level  combination makes me viable for only an Engineering course. Fortunately,   Mechanical Engineering was one of my options, if  you would consider that.
13/12/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 137 9564: Kindly noted
13/12/23, 7:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 7:40 pm - +263 71 137 9564: Okay, thank you for your assistance.
