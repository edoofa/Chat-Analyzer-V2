05/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 873 4584: Edoofa is education for all and gives numerous students who have completed their A level to get scholarships from 60 percent and above. You have an annually fixed amount of fees yo pay and it has 3 stages
 1. Counselling 
2. Admissions 
3. Earn while you learn
05/12/23, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: I would like to correct you that it is 50% not 60%.
05/12/23, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you  about the program myself.
05/12/23, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 873 4584: okay sir
05/12/23, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 11:30 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/12/23, 11:30 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 873 4584: yes sir
05/12/23, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Takudzwa, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 873 4584: yes l do
05/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.

05/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.
05/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 873 4584: okay
05/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
05/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 873 4584: yess l understood it
05/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
05/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
05/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 873 4584: yes l am confident
05/12/23, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
05/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 873 4584: In five years I see myself as a successful lawyer .I have a fascination for crimminal law and would love to be a defence lawyer. This is a choice based not only on passion but the philosophy I hold that everyone is entitled to a fair and just trial. I also believe that there is a need for equality and equity in the law. I also see myself in advocacy work fighting for marginalised who often find that their  defence is compromised. I would hope to have gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in the field, and to be using my skills to help others and make a positive impact on the world. This would enable me to achieve my dreams by providing me with the best possible education and resources to succeed.
05/12/23, 5:03 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
05/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 873 4584: Thank you ,,,have a good day too
06/12/23, 7:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve..”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
06/12/23, 7:53 am - +263 78 873 4584: Goodmorning
06/12/23, 8:24 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
06/12/23, 8:24 am - +263 78 873 4584: yes sir
06/12/23, 8:25 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Takudzwa, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
06/12/23, 8:25 am - +263 78 873 4584: yes l am willing
06/12/23, 8:41 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/12/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 873 4584: l want to study abroad because studying in a different country can help open up new doors and networks that may not be available at home.The universities this side are quite expensive and there's something exciting about the idea of living and learning in a new place, surrounded by new people and new experiences.
06/12/23, 9:09 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 873 4584: I would want to use my experience and knowledge to help improve the education system in my home country. I would do this by sharing what I have learnt with other students and educators, as well as by advocating for educational reforms that could help make the system more effective. For example, I might share my experience with international accreditation standards, which could help to improve the quality of education in my home country and  I would seek to build connections between my home country and the country I study in, to create opportunities for students to learn from each other.
06/12/23, 9:19 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Takudzwa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
06/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 873 4584: l agree
06/12/23, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 873 4584: yes
06/12/23, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
06/12/23, 9:27 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

06/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 873 4584: l have understood it
06/12/23, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: So now Takudzwa, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
06/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 873 4584: No l have no questions sir
06/12/23, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 873 4584: No we not
06/12/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/12/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/12/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/12/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 873 4584: Noted sir l understand
06/12/23, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Takudzwa what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 873 4584: okay
06/12/23, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 873 4584: yes
06/12/23, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: Takudzwa, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 873 4584: okay l understand
06/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

06/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
06/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

06/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
06/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 873 4584: The "earn while you learn" program,  l think is a great opportunity for students  to gain valuable work experience while earning money to help offset the cost of their education. lt will benefit me in a number of ways for example  it will allow me  to gain real-world experience in the field of study, which can make them more competitive in the job market upon graduation and it will help me to develop important skills, such as time management and organization, that will be useful throughout the career.
06/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Takudzwa, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 873 4584: okay
06/12/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
06/12/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>

06/12/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 873 4584: Yes it is
06/12/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: Alright Takudzwa, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/12/23, 10:44 am - +27 66 025 8024: Yes we will be supporting her
06/12/23, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
06/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 873 4584: yess l have
06/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 873 4584: yes l am
06/12/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 78 873 4584: yes
06/12/23, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Takudzwa, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 873 4584: $1500 -$2250
06/12/23, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Takudzwa, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/12/23, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 873 4584: okay
06/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 873 4584: yes l think so
06/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: However Takudzwa, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 873 4584: ohkay
06/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
06/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 873 4584: No
06/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Takudzwa, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in your country itself.
06/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 873 4584: yes l have
06/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
06/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
06/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 873 4584: No l have understood everything
06/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
06/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

07/12/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Hello @263788734584 @27810583151 @27660258024 .

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
07/12/23, 12:17 pm - +27 66 025 8024: Hello sir

Takudzwa is currently offline ,she will be back .She will respond when she is back
07/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Muziri, your presence in this session is most important.
07/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: So are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
07/12/23, 12:21 pm - +27 66 025 8024: Yes we can ,but am at work now so i might take time to respond
07/12/23, 12:21 pm - +27 81 058 3151: Hallo sir how are you
07/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
07/12/23, 12:24 pm - +27 81 058 3151: I am very well thank you
07/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 873 4584: Greetings ....yes sir we can proceed
07/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.
07/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
07/12/23, 12:33 pm - +27 81 058 3151: Yes I have got a question, isn't scholarship supposed to cover the expenses 100%?
07/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Mr.Ndlovu, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
07/12/23, 12:37 pm - +27 66 025 8024: Okay so basically it means we as parents will also have to pay for the fees
07/12/23, 12:45 pm - +27 81 058 3151: Okay noted and another thing in terms of the safety for the students how does your institution go about in that department?
07/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Yes as a parent I understand your concern for the safety of your child, that is why our mentors our constantly in touch with the students and they can get in touch with our representatives who will solve their problem in the university itself.
07/12/23, 12:54 pm - +27 66 025 8024: You haven't responded on this question sir
07/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, the parents have to support, but the student can help you ease that financial burden by paying a major part of his fee through our Earn While You Lern program.
07/12/23, 1:10 pm - +27 81 058 3151: How soon does the Earn while you learn program kicks in after enrollment?
07/12/23, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. <This message was edited>

07/12/23, 1:43 pm - +27 81 058 3151: Don't you have something that will go in line with the career of a student?
07/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: These skills help a student to get confident, interact with new people, gets their creativity running, teaches them discipline and work ethic, be a future leader, and most importantly earn scholarship credits to pay a major part of their fee, do you think this will hamper a student's career?
07/12/23, 2:52 pm - +27 66 025 8024: Noted ,suppose she is enrolled,where do we make the payment
07/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: To make the payment you will be guided, let us first finish the eligibility check evaluation.

08/12/23, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Takudzwa* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
08/12/23, 9:58 am - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then **Takudzwa's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.

08/12/23, 10:17 am - +27 66 025 8024: noted
08/12/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *15th or 16th of December 2023* for $200 and the  *15th or 16th of January 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *15th or 16th of December 2023*
Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

13/12/23, 7:45 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
