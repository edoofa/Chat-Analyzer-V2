You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 9 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
07/12/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Okay sir thank you
08/12/23, 7:49 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 014 8716: Am present
08/12/23, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Shalom,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 014 8716: Okay My Gurvinder am following
08/12/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Shalom, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tadiwanashe, is that correct?
08/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 014 8716: It's correct but currently we are not financially for all those enrollment fees and the other 50%
08/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/12/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: That is a talk that I would like to have with you parents after the counselling session, Shalom.
08/12/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tadiwanashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tadiwanashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Edoofa is a scholarship program that offer 50-100% scholarship......for Edoofa to search for a good university for you, you should pay $350 enrollment fee
The percentage of your scholarship depends on your results
08/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
08/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
08/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 014 8716: That's correct
08/12/23, 7:03 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
08/12/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Thank you sir
09/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,

09/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

11/12/23, 7:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/12/23, 8:04 am - +263 71 694 2691: Good morning Mr Gurvinder. I more than agree with you there.
11/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Shalom, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
11/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 014 8716: I think so Mr Gurvinder
11/12/23, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Now Shalom, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
11/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 014 8716: 1: I don't know what you actually mean by "your highest education level" but as am waiting for my alevel results, am hoping for about 18 - 20 points

13/12/23, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.. <This message was edited>

BCA sounds perfect and interesting for me
13/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
13/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Having given the opportunity to enroll for BCA is gonna make a huge difference for me. Let me start with my poor back ground how it is going to impact my community! The area I grew up is lacking behind in technology advancement. Not only talking of the girl child upliftment. I'm gonna device some programs that are gonna incorporate the tuition and exposing young girls in my community to new technological programs in BCA. Advancement of those ideologies in such poor communities in African countries too. 

The support I'm gonna get from Edoofa institute is gonna make all these dreams come true. This support will encourage me to champion other girls and students from my background to never lose hope in pursuing their dreams no matter how poor our families are. Inform them that there is someone out there who has our dream at their hearts to help us tackle these financial obstacles to achieve our goals. This organization is Edoofa.
Thank you.
13/12/23, 4:59 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Shalom I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Am more than ready Mr Gurvinder
13/12/23, 5:05 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
13/12/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Being specific I really want to study in India because according to my research it is the top country that's specializing in computer science and many students have attained their degrees in computer science in India.

Due to the economic melt down in Zimbabwe we've lost the ability to attain latest technology and we've lost educators for computer science than in India where all of these are available.
Also I've researched and found that there is friendly learning environment for students to learn without being disturbed by any protests, ranging from political etc.
India is far much better in tertiary education than our country.
13/12/23, 5:18 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study in India.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
13/12/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 014 8716: First of all I would bring back the curriculum of India and implement it back here in Zimbabwe

Moreover, I would try to send more youth in India so that they can learn so that they come back and implement their skills and try to develop the Zimbabweans education system.

Furthermore, I would also try on my best level to get the latest technological equipments for learning so that learning can become easy
