You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
12/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 828 3084: Oka Mr Gurvinder

It's an honor to meet you sir Shubham... Senior Academican and Mr Jyotishman,Head of Admissions
12/12/23, 10:07 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Tadiwanashe, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Precious, is that correct?
12/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 828 3084: Yes that is correct
12/12/23, 10:39 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Precious, also do tell me whether you learnt about Precious’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 828 3084: Okay through the journey with precious i learnt that through edoofa's network of higher education institutions, colleges,universities and employers that they share an aim to make quality higher education accessible and affordable, so that we students can pursue our dreams

It helps in scholarships with guarantee of 50% to 100%
Edoofa attachments,internships, and projects help you earn $50-$100 scholarships credits per month
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Yes Mr Gurvinder seeing my mom troubling to find money, she is a widow my father died when I was in fourth grade i had to look for something like this for myself
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: I am sorry to hear that.
12/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tadiwanashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Yes i have Mr Gurvinder
12/12/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tadiwanashe, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

Actuarial Science indeed relies heavily on these subjects, making them fundamental to understanding and excelling in the field. Your affinity for problem-solving indicates a natural aptitude that aligns well with the demands of Actuarial Science.
12/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Additionally, having your father pursue the same program serves as a great motivation. His experience and journey in Actuarial Science likely provide valuable insights and encouragement for your own aspirations. It's fantastic to have that familial connection and guidance when venturing into a field that your father has expertise in. Following in his footsteps can provide you with a unique perspective and support system as you pursue your goals in Actuarial Science.

13/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
13/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 828 3084: Okay in five years time after completing a B.Com degree, I want to pursue a career in accounting. In that case, I would see myself working in the field of accounting five years after completing my degree. I would have gained the necessary skills and knowledge to take on the responsibilities of an accountant, such as preparing financial statements, maintaining records, and providing advice on financial matters. I would be using the resources available to me, such as professional organizations and networking events, to continue my professional development and advance in my career.I would be happy to help Edoofa program that provided the scholarship in any way I can. One way I could help is by being a positive ambassador for the Edoofa program and sharing my experience with others. I could write testimonials or provide references for the Edoofa program, or I could volunteer my time to help with events or outreach efforts. By helping the program, I would be showing my gratitude for the opportunity and giving back to the community
13/12/23, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Tadiwanashe I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
13/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 828 3084: Im willing to give everything in my power in order to transform my career Mr Gurvinder
13/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
13/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 828 3084: I want to study abroad because i want to develop a global mindset which can beneficial in my career and life because when studying abroad Mr Gurvinder i am  exposed to new cultures,ideas and even the way of thinking
13/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
13/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 828 3084: I would aim to use my learnings Mr Gurvinder to help improve the education system in my home country Specifically I would focus on three areas: curriculum development, teacher training, and technology integration. By updating the curriculum to include more global perspectives and teaching methods, I would help students gain a more well-rounded education. By providing professional development opportunities for teachers, I would help them learn new teaching strategies
13/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tadiwanashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
13/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 828 3084: I agree with you Mr Gurvinder but from the hardworkings   i will put in my education i also see myself as a reputed personality in my country to help boost the educational system
13/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
13/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
13/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Yes it's correct
13/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 828 3084: Thank you Mr Gurvinder 🙏🏽
