11/12/23, 8:09 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
11/12/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Okay sir, l will be available and thank you for your patience really appreciate
12/12/23, 8:17 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yes sir
12/12/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 372 3003: I'm free now
12/12/23, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Munashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Munashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 372 3003: I have learnt a lot from Munashe, firstly considering our my background here in Zimbabwe l have noticed that getting a scholarship at your institution will be a great opportunity for me as they offer quality education. Not only do you offer quality education but quality life skills. It has always been my passion to know more or study different cultures" diversity" and with the help of Edoofa l can aquire some of those skills
12/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 372 3003: According to my research l also came across this program where one has to earn money while learning which is also good for us as students because we don't just have to learn theory without applying it to practical like what most universities in Zimbabwe are doing. So it is what also differs Edoofa from other institutions as it teaches us theory and also teach is to apply what we learn into practice
12/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 372 3003: Sorry about late replies l'm having network problems but lm trying my best to get in touch
12/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Ndhlovu! It's fantastic to hear about your interest in Edoofa. The opportunity to receive quality education coupled with life skills is indeed a standout feature of the institution. Your passion for understanding different cultures and diversity aligns perfectly with what Edoofa offers, creating a space where you can acquire these invaluable skills.
12/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Let me give you a brief about the program myself.
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 372 3003: Exactly, l want to help reduce the burden of my parents
12/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 372 3003: Yeah it will be a great opportunity for me if l get this scholarship as it will help me gain quality skills and education as well as helping my parents reduce their financial burden
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Ndhlovu, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Definitely
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 372 3003: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Now Prosper, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
12/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 372 3003: My name is Njabulo Prosper Ndhlovu, a boy aged 19 residing in Amaveni a high density area in the city of Kwekwe Zimbabwe.
•) Currently l am waiting for my A'level results as l aspire to be an electrical or mechanical engineer. •)My dad is a truck driver and my mother a teacher and still not employed which,  makes it difficult for both l and my siblings to acquire quality education because my father is the only one working yet earning peanuts, and l believe that he is the one who will be supporting me with my education abroad.
 •)Since nursery up to now my parents are the ones that have been supportinge with my education.
•) My mom and dad managed to acquire their O'level certificates as their highest level of education.
•) l have two siblings a boy and a girl, the boy doing her high school level that is form 2 next year and the girl doing her primary level that is  grade 7 next year.
•) Currently l was studying at Kwekwe high school located in Midlands, and fees was $150 per -term.
In an addition l would like to say that my parents have always taught me that education is the key to success and their teachings are the one's that are driving me to acquire what l want to be in life.
12/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: That's a wonderful addition, Prosper! The guidance and teachings of parents about the significance of education as a pathway to success are incredibly valuable. Their wisdom and support serve as a guiding force, motivating you to pursue your aspirations and work towards your goals in life.
12/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
12/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
12/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 372 3003: On that note l would like to share my deputy head's contact number because he's the one who was always available at school.

Name of deputy Head:  Mr D takawira.

12/12/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/12/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study electrical or mechanical engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
12/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Because since childhood it has always been my passion to design and construct models of machines and especially with the combination l was doing in Physics we would always design and construct models of certain machines. Also when there is a problem with household circuits be it lighting systems etc l fix the problem and because of this l have gained passion in wanting to be in these fields rather than medicine
12/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Prosper, your passion for electrical and mechanical engineering since childhood is truly inspiring! It's fantastic that from a young age, you were drawn to designing and constructing machine models, showing a natural inclination toward understanding how things work and are built. The combination of designing models in physics further fueled your interest in these fields, highlighting your knack for hands-on problem-solving and creativity.
12/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in these fields?
12/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 372 3003: My uncle who's a mechanical engineer
12/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 372 3003: And he's also the one who is inspiring me
12/12/23, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
12/12/23, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
12/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Okay
12/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Is it possible for me to send tomorrow or night after l have arranged for my report card
12/12/23, 6:15 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
12/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Thank you and same to you sir
13/12/23, 7:41 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/12/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 372 3003: Good morning how are you!
13/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 460 8240: Good morning everyone l'm Prosper Ndhlovu's mother
13/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 372 3003: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering*
13/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 372 3003: Okay do you mind explaining further why  think that it will cater my likings
13/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.
13/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.
13/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
13/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 372 3003: Okay so do these types of engineering mentioned above fall under Bachelor of Technology Mechanical engineering for example mechatronics. All B.tech mechanical engineering specialise with automotive only?
13/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Indeed, the Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering encompasses various specializations and sub-disciplines within the broader field of mechanical engineering. Here's a breakdown:

Mechanics: This covers the study of forces, deformation, and materials. It includes statics, dynamics, mechanics of materials, fluid mechanics, and kinematics.

Mechatronics and Robotics: Mechatronics integrates mechanics, electronics, and software engineering to create hybrid systems. Robotics is an application of mechatronics where robots are designed and used for various tasks.

Thermodynamics and Thermo-science: This branch deals with energy transformation in systems, such as automotive engines converting fuel into heat and mechanical work.

Design and Drafting: This involves technical drawing and design, crucial for creating products and manufacturing instructions. It includes traditional drafting techniques and modern computer-aided design (CAD).

Regarding your query about automotive specialization, Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering doesn't exclusively specialize in automotive engineering. It covers a wide array of disciplines as mentioned earlier, including automotive engineering but not limited to it. Students pursuing this degree can choose various paths based on their interests, be it production engineering, industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, and more.

So, mechatronics, for instance, is a specialized sub-discipline falling under mechanical engineering, and while automotive engineering is a part of mechanical engineering, the degree isn’t solely centered on automotive studies. There's a diverse range of opportunities and specialties available within a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering beyond automotive engineering.
13/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Okay thankyou, l interested with the course
13/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 372 3003: l am*
13/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
13/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Yeah from what l understood, l think you said that l can also partake in fields like mechatronics, mechanics, thermodynamics and thermo science etc with a degree in B. Tech mechanical engineering as there are more specialties and opportunities within the course. That is if lm not mistaken
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
13/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 372 3003: This would be a great opportunity for me if l am to provided this career because, like l said it has been my dream since childhood to become a mechanical engineer. Taking your question into account in 5 years time l am seeing myself having my own company of engineering because l like it when l am my own boss and it also gives me an opportunity to help other people who will be in need. It has been my passion too to start a multi organisation institution which helps those in need be it job opportunities, clothes, food etc and to achieve this l would need your institution Edoofa to help because not only do you help us gain quality education but also principles which makes us human beings in the society. I have researched a lot about Edoofa and also followed some of the Edoofans and by doing so l gained a lot interest with Edoofa because l have seen that there are more qualities which l can learn from you, like teamwork, communication skills through interactions, critical thinking which will help me in future as l would be my own boss. So there is a lot to learn from Edoofa which l can use to achieve my dreams and that is why l found it necessary to apply and work with Edoofa.
13/12/23, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Prosper I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
13/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 372 3003: I am willing to,even to give more that 200%
13/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 372 3003: more than*
13/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
13/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 372 3003: 1)l have many reasons for instance our economy  in Zimbabwe is not stable and due to this there is an increase in fees which makes it difficult for us as students to accomplish our dreams because there is no employment.But taking India into consideration for example with the help of Edoofa l can earn money while learning and this will reduce the burden of my parents because l will be able to meet some of my expenses alone, while they "my parents" will be striving to give my siblings better education with me also helping where necessary. 
2) In this world we are living in technology is now taking over and my country Zimbabwe is behind interms of technology which makes it difficult for us as students to achieve most of our dreams, but taking India into consideration according to my research it's one of the best country interms of being advanced when it comes to technology and that is wy l also applied to Edoofa because this will help me achieve my dreams.
3) Due to rise in inflation in Zimbabwe data prices are increasing daily and assignments need a lot of data so if l have the opportunity to study abroad "India" it would reduce the burden because data prices are affordable compared to Zimbabwe.
4)Like John B. Ervin, l believe in the importance of gaining a good education, and l also share his 
passion in engaging my community and helping to bring diverse people together. I am interested in learning different cultures hence studying abroad in countries like India, especially at your institutions where many students all over countries gather, l will be able to explore all the cultures hence become better interms of associating and communicating with different races.
13/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
13/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Okay l think l said it before that l would like to start multi organisation which be based in my home country where l will be  also helping all students with scholarships and at my institution l will be able to contribute all that l would have learnt abroad hence by that these teachings will spread in the country hence improvement of education system in Zimbabwe
13/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 372 3003: It will be like a hierarchy where what l would have learnt, will also be taught to the students at this institution and the students will also accomplish their goes and teach the teachings to other people hence the teachings will spread easily.
13/12/23, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Prosper, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
13/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 372 3003: I agree
13/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 372 3003: I agree and that's why l need you as Edoofa to counsel and guide me on the right path
13/12/23, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
13/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Yeah it's true
13/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

13/12/23, 4:59 pm - Gurvinder: So now Prosper, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 372 3003: I understood everything
13/12/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 372 3003: All my questions are answered, l guess.
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
13/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 372 3003: No
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/12/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 372 3003: This is fair
13/12/23, 5:25 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Prosper what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
13/12/23, 5:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
13/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Yes
13/12/23, 7:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 372 3003: Okay same to you sir
13/12/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 372 3003: This is nice🫶🏽
