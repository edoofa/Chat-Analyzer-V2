05/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Thank you
05/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 181 2322: May you brief me about the Edoofa schoolarship
05/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Thank you
05/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 181 2322: How many subjects should l pass to obtain the schoolarship
05/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
05/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
05/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 181 2322: so how about If u haven't done the A level ...but did the O level

05/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 181 2322: I have completed my O level am currently waiting for the results
05/12/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Then what does this mean?
05/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: This indicates that you have to do O-level next year.
05/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: And that is why I did not started your counselling session.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

06/12/23, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
06/12/23, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

06/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now Ncube, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Wow Sit it seems like all software's are from India this is great
06/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Ofcause l would like to ask about the journey to India as k was attractive by the Edoofa Schoolarship
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Does the Edoofa schoolarship program take you from Zimbabwe to India.. if it is how
06/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of travelling is a one-time cost that you have to bear, but our experts will guide you through the VISA application process.
06/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Okay how much will be that
06/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Not really Sir
06/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: That depends from time to time.
06/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Okay
06/12/23, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Ncube, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Okay Sir thank you
06/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 181 2322: I get that thank you again
06/12/23, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Yes Sir
06/12/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Ncube, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 181 2322: That's great Thank you Sir
06/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 181 2322: This is promising a lot
06/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
06/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

06/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Ofcause the program  benefits as diverse benefits are offered
06/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Ncube, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 181 2322: I get that sir ... The schoorship help a lot thank you
06/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
06/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>

06/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Ofcause this is such a great opportunity
06/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 181 2322: I see
06/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: Ncube, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
06/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Ofcause am now openly minded about the program that a thanks to you Sir
06/12/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Ncube, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Ofcause they will be.
06/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Yes sir we discussed a lot
06/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Yes l Have been discussing with my mother ..
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Yes Sir
06/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Ncube as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 181 2322: If the student applies for five universities he or she may end up spending $1500-$2250
06/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Ncube, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Ofcause parents may not afford... It's great pleasure that's students have lowered amounts
06/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 181 2322: thanks great Sir
06/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 181 2322: So other candidates will be going to Indi a on the un cancelled  dates above
06/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: No, the dates are for what the enrollment fee is on that day.
06/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Yes l do
06/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Okay Sir
06/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
06/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Where is the enrollment fees paid
06/12/23, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Let us finish the counselling session first, you will be guided for that.
06/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Okay Sir
06/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: .
06/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 181 2322: I think so
06/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: However Ncube, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Okay l get that l will inform them thank you
06/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
06/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 181 2322: okay Sir
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 181 2322: No
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Ncube, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 181 2322: I have understood thank you
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Yes
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Yes sir
06/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Okay sir
06/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 181 2322: Okay
06/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 181 2322: I would like us to continue
06/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
06/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?


 16 years after the 1994 Rwandan genocide, life in the country has undergone many changes. The economy has grown, infrastructure has been rebuilt, and the government has made efforts to promote reconciliation and healing. However, the country still faces many challenges, including poverty, unemployment, and a lack of access to healthcare and education.
Despite these challenges, life in Rwanda is slowly improving. The economy is growing, with GDP increasing by an average of 8% per year since 2000. The government has invested in infrastructure, with new roads, bridges, and buildings being constructed across the country. The government has also invested in health and education.
 Overall, life in Rwanda is still a challenge for many people, but there have been significant improvements since the genocide. The economy is growing, infrastructure is being rebuilt, and the government is working to improve access to healthcare and education. There is still much work to be done, but the country is making progress. As one survivor of the genocide said, "Rwanda is like a child that is learning to walk again. We may fall down, but we get up again and keep going.
 For many Rwandans, the most significant change since the genocide has been the shift in attitudes towards reconciliation and forgiveness. Before the genocide, the country was deeply divided along ethnic lines. Hutus and Tutsis lived separate lives, and the divide was reinforced by the government and the media. However, since the genocide, there has been a concerted effort to promote reconciliation. The government has implemented a "Gacaca" justice system, which allows communities to deal with the crimes of the genocide locally, rather than through the formal court system.

PERSONALITY TEST
"My Inspirational
 When I was a child, I loved to play doctor. I would dress up in a white lab coat and pretend to take my stuffed animals' temperatures and give them pretend injections. I didn't know it at the time, but this was the start of my interest in the medical field. As I grew older, I learned more about the role of a medical laboratory technician and realized that it was the perfect career for me.
I love the idea of being able to help people by analyzing their blood, urine, and other samples. Knowing that my work could help diagnose diseases or illnesses is very fulfilling to me. I also enjoy the id I know that being a medical laboratory technician will be challenging at times, but I am determined to succeed. I have always been a hard worker, and I am not afraid of long hours or difficult tasks. In fact, I find the idea of working in a lab to be exciting and invigorating. I know that there will be days when I am tired and stressed, but I know that it will all be worth it in the end. I want to be able to look back on my career and know that I made a difference in people's lives. That is why I want to become a medical laboratory technician.
I am particularly interested in the field of hematology, which is the study of blood and blood-forming tissues. I find it fascinating to learn about the different types of blood cells and how they function. I am also interested in the role of blood in diagnosing and treating diseases. I believe that a career in hematology would allow me to use my analytical skills to help others in a meaningful way. It is my hope that one day I will be able to work in a hematology lab, where I can put my knowledge and skills to good use.
