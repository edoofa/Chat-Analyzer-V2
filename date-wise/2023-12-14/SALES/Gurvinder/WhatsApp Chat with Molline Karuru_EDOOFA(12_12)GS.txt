12/12/23, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Molline, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Resistance, is that correct?

12/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 698 8605: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 698 8605: Providing Higher education quality and enabling a student to be a critical thinker and have responcsebility skills
12/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me also brief you about the program.
12/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: But first I want to ask you that you reply through text only.
12/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 698 8605: Ohhhhh okay sorry
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Yes it is
12/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Molline, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Definitely l think so
12/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Now Molline, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 910 0332: Agreed
12/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Okay Noted
12/12/23, 6:27 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
12/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 698 8605: I am really sorry for the late response  due to some network problems

13/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 698 8605: My name is Molline Karuru and aged 19 l am a Zimbabwean and live in Harare l am a former student at FD Roosevelt Girls High at which l was currently doing my A level studies and now waiting for my final results.There l was the senior prefect and led various formal clubs as the president which includes ZUNA ,debate and public speaking which have been a driving force in which l would love to indulge in the faculty of law.Besides being in these formal clubs l was and also a volleyball player.The school is located in Harare Eastlea and my per-term A level fees amounted to USD 300.My mom is an accountant and has attained a Bachelor in Business Management and Accounting she is the one who takes care and is responsible for my education fees.My father is decreased and l am the only child my mother has.Be that as it may,l am a student who is highly devoted to her education and career and takes full responsibility of that.
13/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Once again I am sorry for the late replies
13/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: I am so sorry to hear about your father.
13/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 698 8605: It's fine
13/12/23, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths.

13/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Thank you
13/12/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Law, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
13/12/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Well l feel like a lot of innocent souls ended up in jail not because they were guilty enough or couldn't defend themselves but they lacked people who could have defended them better in the eyes of law only because they had insufficient funds they couldn't get the lawyers they wanted .So if the current system is failing to provide and bring Justice to the people and us having millions of people who are eager and would love to change that and me being one of them then I must say what is needed is an opportunity for that change to take place
13/12/23, 5:03 pm - Gurvinder: Molline, your motivation to pursue Law is truly admirable. Your insight into the shortcomings of the legal system regarding access to justice due to financial limitations is profound. Your desire to be a part of a change that ensures everyone has fair and adequate legal representation speaks volumes about your commitment to justice and equality. Your aspiration to bridge this gap and empower those who lack resources to seek rightful justice is commendable. Your passion for creating a more equitable legal system is a testament to your dedication and vision for a better society.
13/12/23, 5:03 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
13/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 698 8605: No
13/12/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 698 8605: And that's why l am inspired to be the  first
13/12/23, 5:10 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
