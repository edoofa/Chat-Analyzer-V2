I would also like to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough for resources and study materials, due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting. Therefore, after the evaluations, the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about her achieving it

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

20/09/23, 11:47 am - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued about your child to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on her career?
20/09/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Studying in India will.expose her to modern learning techniques. It will also expose her to modern learning facilities. Since India draws students from all over the world.my child will be exposed to various cultures thereby learn how various people around the world behave which i think hepls in moulding an international acclaimed professional
20/09/23, 12:10 pm - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
20/09/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I am sorry I am not aware
20/09/23, 12:12 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/09/23, 12:12 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Yes sir we can afford
20/09/23, 12:15 pm - Kunal: Good to know
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
20/09/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 305 0093: No sir I am aware how it is done
20/09/23, 12:23 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/09/23, 12:23 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

20/09/23, 12:23 pm - Kunal: *Webinars: -*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

20/09/23, 12:23 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.

20/09/23, 1:04 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
20/09/23, 1:40 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
20/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Yes we can proceed Sir
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
20/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
20/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
20/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
20/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
20/09/23, 2:15 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
20/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 305 0093: No connected had lost connection
20/09/23, 2:16 pm - Kunal: I understand
Can you participate now?
20/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 305 0093: yes i can now
20/09/23, 2:17 pm - Kunal: So, please address this and let us continue
20/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Number 2
20/09/23, 2:18 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

20/09/23, 2:18 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Primrose with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I will be helping her with the remaining fees
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
20/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 305 0093: It will be an honour to myself and our family.
20/09/23, 2:22 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make her career advance at even a greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
20/09/23, 2:22 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Passport is also required.

Student Visa depending on the country
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I am following sir. I can see that we are set to benefit
20/09/23, 2:30 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
20/09/23, 2:30 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
20/09/23, 2:30 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
20/09/23, 2:30 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Understood its very clear
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Stage  number 2
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
20/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Fine Sir
20/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
20/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
20/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Its clear Sir
20/09/23, 2:48 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

21/09/23, 1:49 pm - Austin: Glad to hear that!
So may I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
21/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 305 0093: So far the fugures  which were mentioned yesterday are within our reach we can afford them
21/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I mean the figures which should borne by the parent or guardian
21/09/23, 1:58 pm - Austin: I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child's career!
21/09/23, 2:00 pm - Austin: Is Primrose available for a discussion?
21/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 305 0093: No Sir, Though we can arrange with the school head.
21/09/23, 2:07 pm - Austin: I can understand!
21/09/23, 2:07 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 2:07 pm - Austin: Mr Cheukai and Mrs Lucia, Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

Along with moral support, financial support is also a significant factor in higher education. We will begin the eligibility check process for your child today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?*. Your acknowledgement is mandatory to proceed and we expect it before the day's end as we are currently overwhelmed with applications.

*Please answer using voice notes*
21/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Its fine sir let me go through the document. Expect my answer in voice notes shortly
21/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 305 0093: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 305 0093: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Austin: Thank you for the confirmation, it has been duly noted!
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Austin: As you know, form 6 students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

So all these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Primrose?*
21/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I am will to take up the seat reservation interview call for Primrose
21/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 305 0093: *willing*
21/09/23, 2:51 pm - Austin: So,  can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that Primrose would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will she be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost o studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
21/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 305 0093: 1) Bachelor of Arts-Bachelor of Legislative Law(BA LLB)
2) India
3) Average of US$6 000.00 to US$8 000.00 per year
4) Average of US$2 000.00 to US$3 000.00
