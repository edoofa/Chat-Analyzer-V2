27/12/23, 2:31 PM - +263 77 382 1026: Well, thank you 
We were very impressed by the way that Edoofa scholarship program was presented by Mr Shashwat .
To be honest we had no idea that the Edoofa scholarship program existed in this world but all thanks to Mr Shashwat he has been very professional.
He highlighted the cost of education in India which is $6000-$8000 because of the scholarship the education fee is reduced to $1200-$1800 which is a huge relief to parents and guardians.
In addition to that he mentioned the EWYL program which further discounts the fee.
Lastly the scholarship enriches the student with skills of  being employable.

Thank you
27/12/23, 2:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: I have known Mr. Shashwat for a long time and he always ensures that each and every student of his gets personalized attention so that he can ensure their academic career is on track.
