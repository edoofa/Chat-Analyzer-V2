27/12/23, 11:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263775714451 I was looking forward for your response regarding the update on the remaining amount for your registration fees. Since the deadline date is just around the corner, I wanted to reach out to you to understand the current status of your financial preparations for this crucial opportunity?

Have you been able to raise the balance amount of $337 by now and finalize the date on when you are going to make the payment of your fee?
