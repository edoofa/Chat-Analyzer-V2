19/12/23, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyarai ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
19/12/23, 2:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
19/12/23, 3:04 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Greetings, Ms Ashi . I hope you are all doing well. Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I am excited to learn more and I appreciate your time and expertise."
19/12/23, 3:05 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Received with thanks !
19/12/23, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263788961515, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
19/12/23, 3:10 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Yes ma'am we can proceed .
19/12/23, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
19/12/23, 3:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
19/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 78 896 1515: 1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
 -975USD
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
-4years.
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
-200USD
4. What’s the Registration fee?
-700USD.
19/12/23, 3:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
19/12/23, 3:27 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Soo does it mean it's the program fee.
19/12/23, 3:27 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Written on the offer letter ?
19/12/23, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263788961515 Yes dear, It's your program fees
19/12/23, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU - <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
19/12/23, 3:32 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Okay Ma'am it's clear now.
19/12/23, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
19/12/23, 3:41 PM - +263 78 896 1515: If I may ask , it starts with how many seaters ?
19/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, This is four seater room please
19/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
19/12/23, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and they would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether they wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
19/12/23, 3:48 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Okay what about off campus how many seaters and are they boarding houses sort of ?
19/12/23, 3:49 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Yes , this is very clear .
19/12/23, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263788961515 The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. Mostly, The student prefers two seater room however it still depends on the student choice.
19/12/23, 3:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
19/12/23, 3:58 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Okay Ma'am thank you . 
I prefer off campus .
19/12/23, 3:59 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Yes I'm clear we can move on.
19/12/23, 4:10 PM - +263 78 896 1515: ~Off campus~  correction on this I am opting for on campus accommodation thank you!
19/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 1st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
19/12/23, 4:22 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Yes we are together ma'am but can pay the amount around 20 January. 
I'm sorry for the inconvenience but I have my siblings who are going to boarding school first week of January. My mother will be able to pay with her monthly salary which comes between 15 and 20 January.
19/12/23, 4:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern @263788961515, We will talk about the same soon. However, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/12/23, 4:28 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Yes you can explàn ma'am.
19/12/23, 4:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of  January 31st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *December 31st, 2023*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/12/23, 4:46 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Yes it is clear Ma'am.
19/12/23, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/12/23, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/12/23, 4:56 PM - +263 78 896 1515: I stay in Waterfalls , Harare.
19/12/23, 5:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/12/23, 5:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/12/23, 5:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/12/23, 5:09 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Thank you ma'am. 

I will contact him.
19/12/23, 5:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
19/12/23, 5:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
19/12/23, 5:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles..

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
19/12/23, 5:10 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Okay Ma'am.
19/12/23, 5:11 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Let me deal with Mr Rajan
19/12/23, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I am sharing the account details of Mr. Charles with you for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
19/12/23, 5:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/12/23, 5:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, you can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Yes ma'am this is very clear .
19/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/12/23, 5:22 PM - +263 78 896 1515: May I ask , after the end of the semester what happens ,ie where do we stay and what do we do  waiting for the other semester .
19/12/23, 5:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me assist you here @263788961515, I'd like to provide assurance that despite the absence of classes during the semester break, the accommodation will continue to be available and accessible throughout the entirety of the academic year. This means that the student has the flexibility to either reside at their accommodation or explore the option of traveling in India or returning home during this break, knowing that their accommodation remains secure and open throughout their entire career.
19/12/23, 5:27 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Okay thank Ma'am 😊for shading more light .
19/12/23, 5:27 PM - +263 78 896 1515: Thank you **
19/12/23, 5:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
19/12/23, 5:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
19/12/23, 5:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

19/12/23, 5:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263788961515, Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.
