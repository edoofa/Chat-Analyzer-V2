I trust you're all in good health. I wanted to reach out today, as the second deadline is drawing near. Hence I wanted to check on your preparations for this and to inquire about your plans, especially considering the upcoming festival season. Could you please let me know which date you have in mind to make the payment for the second deadline?

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $337 for your university registration fee is due before January 1, 2024. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations as you did not respond to our message shared earlier.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $337 by now?
27/12/23, 9:36 AM - +263 77 230 3068: Paying tomorrow 28 Dec 2023

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. I shall wait for an update from your end tomorrow. Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here.
