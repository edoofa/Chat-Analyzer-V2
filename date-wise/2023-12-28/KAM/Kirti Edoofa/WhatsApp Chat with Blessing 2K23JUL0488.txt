I trust you're all in good health. I wanted to reach out today, as the second deadline is drawing near.

Could you please let me know which date you have in mind to make the payment for the second deadline?

26/12/23, 3:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $330 for your university registration fee is due before January 1, 2024. Consequently, I wanted to reach out since you have not responded to our previous message.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $330 by now?
26/12/23, 3:51 PM - +263 77 665 3491: Afternoon Madam.
26/12/23, 3:53 PM - +263 77 665 3491: Yes the remaining amount is $330 bt am not done and i think i will get the total amount on 29 December and do the payment on the same day
26/12/23, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. I have duly noted the information and will inform both the accounts team and the university officials accordingly. 

However, as we are currently in the festive season, there's a possibility that you might encounter unforeseen challenges at the bank. 

To be on the side of caution, we advise making the payment a day in advance. This precaution ensures you have a backup day, minimizing the risk of losing out on the entire opportunity. I trust you have taken note of our recommendation?
26/12/23, 3:57 PM - +263 77 665 3491: Yes Madam
26/12/23, 3:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great day ahead and do convey my regards to your parents as well.
26/12/23, 4:02 PM - +263 77 665 3491: Thank you

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for the last part of your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
