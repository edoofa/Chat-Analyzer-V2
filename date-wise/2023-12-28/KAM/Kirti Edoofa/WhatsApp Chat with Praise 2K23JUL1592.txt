Our wish is not to deprive our daughter of an opportunity to further her studies so we will continue to strive hard to make sure that she has access to better education

Your determination to not let financial hurdles deprive your daughter of her educational opportunities is truly commendable. It's evident that you place a high value on her education and are willing to put in the effort to ensure she has access to better learning opportunities. This kind of support is invaluable to a student's academic journey and personal growth.
27/12/23, 12:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please feel free to connect if you have any concerns, as we want the same for your daughter. And I shall wait for an update from your end. Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here.
