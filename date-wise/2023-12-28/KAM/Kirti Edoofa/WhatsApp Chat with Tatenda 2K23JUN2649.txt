I hope this message finds you well. I'm truly sorry to hear about the passing of your sister. It's understandable that such a significant and unexpected family event would impact your financial plans, including the payment of the admission fee. Your request to shift the deadline to the 20th of January 2024 due to these unforeseen circumstances is understandable.
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Considering you've brought this concern to our attention in a timely manner, I believe we can discuss the matter with university officials to explore a solution that prevents Tatenda from missing out on this valuable scholarship opportunity. This scholarship serves as the initial stepping stone for her to access higher-quality education and pave the way for a successful career.

This will enable us to align your needs with the university's policies and find a suitable solution.
