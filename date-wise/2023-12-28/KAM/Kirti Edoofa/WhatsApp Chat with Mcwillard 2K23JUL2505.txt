I trust this message finds you in good health and that you had a delightful Christmas. Following up on our earlier discussion, I understand that you are scheduled to make a deposit on the 28th of December. I'm reaching out to check on your preparations and to ask if there are any updates or progress you'd like to share with us?

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. However, as we are currently in the festive season, there's a possibility that you might encounter unforeseen challenges at the bank. 

To be on the side of caution, we advise making the payment a day in advance. This precaution ensures you have a backup day, minimizing the risk of losing out on the entire opportunity. I trust you have taken note of our recommendation?
