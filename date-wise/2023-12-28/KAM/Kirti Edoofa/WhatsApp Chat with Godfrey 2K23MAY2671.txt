I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the amount of $250 for your university registration fee is due before January 2, 2024. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $250 by now?

27/12/23, 2:39 PM - +263 77 267 0032: We are still raising the money will make payment on 2 January

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. However, as we are currently in the holiday season, there's a possibility that you might encounter unforeseen challenges at the bank. 

To be on the side of caution, we advise making the payment a day in advance. This precaution ensures you have a backup day, minimizing the risk of losing out on the entire opportunity. I trust you have taken note of our recommendation?
