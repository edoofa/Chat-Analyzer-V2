27/12/23, 2:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern here @263777564664 This is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you Please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
