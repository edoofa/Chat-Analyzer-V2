27/12/23, 10:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you are doing well today and have a wonderful Christmas. Over the past couple of days, I was hoping to get a response from your end the other day on your current preparation for the second part of the registration fees. However, it seems that all my efforts seem to be in vain. As it has been a while now and I also noticed that you have also seen my message as well.

Hence, I wanted to give you a gentle reminder today again that tomorrow marks the deadline for the second part of your university registration process. Hence I am committed to ensuring that everything goes well accordingly. So, if you are having any challenges just let me know of the same.
