18/12/23, 12:47 PM - You joined using this group's invite link
18/12/23, 2:49 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Melisa. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Thank you for being patient with us. May I know if you are currently available at the moment so that we can proceed with the session?
18/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Yes sir I am
18/12/23, 5:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/12/23, 5:23 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/12/23, 5:24 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Yes  sir
18/12/23, 5:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Yes please
18/12/23, 6:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/12/23, 6:24 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/12/23, 6:27 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Yes sir it's clear thank you
18/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/12/23, 7:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/12/23, 9:41 PM - +263 77 369 1162: I don't stay in Harare. I stay in Rushinga to the North Eastern part of Zimbabwe
19/12/23, 7:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:40 PM - +263 77 369 1162: Good evening Sir. Iam ready
19/12/23, 7:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/12/23, 7:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/12/23, 7:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/12/23, 7:43 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/12/23, 7:48 PM - +263 77 369 1162: Thanks a lot Sir. Please may you kindly send his details
19/12/23, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
19/12/23, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
19/12/23, 9:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
19/12/23, 10:26 PM - +263 77 369 3241: Thank you sir. I think I would rather prefer to use Mr Shorwi's as I used to do if you don't mind for me to use the Ecocash. I will  add the Ecocash charges. Waiting to hear from you. Thank you
19/12/23, 10:27 PM - +263 77 369 3241: Thank you. Good time
20/12/23, 2:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Melisa. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.

21/12/23, 10:59 AM - +263 78 050 5370: I am very sorry  I couldn't  connect with you yesterday. It is  because I was  not around  yesterday. I and my  colleagues ( youths)had visited  old people's home and  assisted them with the  little things  we had
21/12/23, 2:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Melisa. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

No need to apologize at all. Your commitment to helping the elderly speaks volumes about your character. It's truly heartwarming to know about your thoughtful initiative with your colleagues. Please let me know if you are available to proceed with the session?
21/12/23, 2:11 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Yes I am available  sir. Thank you for  your  understanding
21/12/23, 2:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
21/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Ok thank you  sir
21/12/23, 2:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
21/12/23, 2:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/12/23, 2:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
21/12/23, 2:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/12/23, 2:23 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Yes sure and I promise  to  work extra hard
21/12/23, 2:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is the spirit. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
21/12/23, 2:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
21/12/23, 2:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/12/23, 2:37 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Wow this sounds great  sir.
21/12/23, 2:51 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/12/23, 2:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 78 050 5370: Thank you sir 🙏
21/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 78 050 5370: So far everything is  clear sir
21/12/23, 2:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that and you are most welcome. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
