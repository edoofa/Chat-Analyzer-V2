How are you?
26/12/23, 8:11 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Caroline, this student that you referred, his due date to pay the enrollment fees is tomorrow. I am sure you will connect with him and congratulate him on his selection by the Academic Board of Edoofa. Along with that, also enquired about the status of his payment.

27/12/23, 4:08 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Caroline,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
