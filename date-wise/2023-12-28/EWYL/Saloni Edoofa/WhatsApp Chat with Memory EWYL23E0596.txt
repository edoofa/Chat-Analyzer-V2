26/12/23, 8:42 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How was your Christmas celebration🎄?

I am so excited to see how you celebrated it with your loved ones and friends, and yes, what all you receive in your gifts🎁?

We will discuss all this in our scheduled session that will be happening from *01:30-02:30 PM* this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday.
Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
26/12/23, 9:52 AM - +263 71 401 4355: Greetings Ms Saloni!.The Christmas celebrations were great💯 though we did not do much rather a family gathering since our culture does not permit us to celebrate Christmas. I would have loved to share the pictures with you but unfortunately I am not a huge fan of the camera😔. And if possible may I be excused for today's session please. The farm workers have not resumed from the holidays yet so I'll be helping out today.
26/12/23, 1:34 PM - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with the session?
26/12/23, 1:36 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad that you had a lovely time with your loved ones and yes, please take today's time. I understand your commitments.

27/12/23, 1:48 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes go on
27/12/23, 1:49 PM - +263 71 401 4355: When am I supposed to start the project and when is it due?
27/12/23, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
27/12/23, 1:55 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Ma'am  thank you
27/12/23, 1:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any questions about this, Memory? I can help you.
27/12/23, 1:57 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Yes. So this means I may start project 1 today or there is more I need to understand before I commence?
27/12/23, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you go through all the projects once and then decide on how and on which project you need to work.
27/12/23, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Memory, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Memory!
27/12/23, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:14 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Maam thank you. So it really does not matter which project I start first? I may also start with the one I understand the most?
27/12/23, 2:14 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Ma'am
27/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Noted Ma'am
27/12/23, 2:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you can do that
27/12/23, 2:17 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Did you listen to the audio?
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - +263 71 401 4355: I've understood this very well thank you!
27/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you
27/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Yes Ma'am
27/12/23, 2:23 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from it?
27/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 71 401 4355: I've understood that for the sake of community building and organization growth the purpose of project to is to create  networking and persuasion skills to link with students around Africa and refer them to the Edoofa programme. The students may also be friends, family or relatives who habe graduated from senior secondary school or in the past 6 months. After successfully finishing the project scholarship credits are offered that is $20 for every student enrolled in the EDOOFA scholarship programme, $30 for completion of Admission Formalities of the university and an additional opportunity of earning $5 worth scholarship credits per student that EDOOFA connects with you for clarity on the programme. Thank you
