27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Jeremiah,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
27/12/23, 8:56 PM - +91 76269 26817: The grant is very significant to me, it's just that these past weeks I've been caught up in school work
27/12/23, 8:56 PM - +91 76269 26817: I promise to do my best in my EWYL program
27/12/23, 9:47 PM - +260 97 7751697: Please do so.
