As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.

As we gear up for our session, let's kick things off with a dose of motivation from Sundar Pichai:

"You might fail a few times, but that's Ok. You end up doing something worthwhile which you learn a great deal from." 🚀

In these powerful words, Pichai unveils the magic of embracing challenges. Failures aren't roadblocks but rather detours leading to invaluable lessons and remarkable achievements. 🌟

So, how are you doing today? 🌈 I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session. Let's turn challenges into opportunities and make this session truly worthwhile!
