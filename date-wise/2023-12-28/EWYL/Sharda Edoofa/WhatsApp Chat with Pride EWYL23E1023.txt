I hope you are doing well. My name is Sharda, and you can refer to me as Ms. Sharda. I am here to be the person who helps turn your dream of financing your education through project work into a reality. As your EWYL mentor, I am looking forward to guiding you to make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

26/12/23, 8:32 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good Morning Pride*
I hope you are doing well

As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.
26/12/23, 8:38 AM - +263 77 955 1065: My Christmas was very fine. We visited my grandmother at Mberengwa here in Zimbabwe. We had so much funny😁

How was your Christmas?
26/12/23, 8:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you had a delightful Christmas visiting your grandmother in Mberengwa! Family gatherings are always special. As for me, I too had a great time at our family lunch where all of us gathered. How did you find spending time with your family during the festive season? Is there anything specific you'd like to share or discuss? 😊🎄
26/12/23, 8:55 AM - +263 77 955 1065: My grandmother works at Msume high school here in Mberengwa so yesterday we went to her working place to do some cleanings.  There is a distance  from her house to the working place. We then returned home , bathed and cooked food. Food is my thing😅😅.This Christmas was very different  because there was no fruits to eat such as mangoes. This was due to climate change which caused the temperatures to be high and no rainfall. Believe me, l was very bored 😩because l like mangoes.
26/12/23, 8:56 AM - Sharda Edoofa: It's wonderful that you spent time with your grandmother and contributed to the community by helping with cleanings at Msume High School. It's also understandable how the absence of fruits, like mangoes, due to climate change could affect the usual Christmas experience. Changes in climate can indeed have various impacts on the environment and traditions. Despite the differences, it's clear that your focus on family, helping out, and enjoying good food made the day special in its own way.
26/12/23, 8:58 AM - +263 77 955 1065: Yes😅
26/12/23, 8:58 AM - +263 77 955 1065: I like eating
26/12/23, 8:58 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great Pride. Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
26/12/23, 8:58 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Eating is one of life's simple pleasures! Whether it's savoring delicious meals, enjoying festive treats, or exploring different cuisines, food can bring a lot of joy.

As we gear up for our session, let's kick things off with a dose of motivation from Sundar Pichai:

"You might fail a few times, but that's Ok. You end up doing something worthwhile which you learn a great deal from." 🚀
