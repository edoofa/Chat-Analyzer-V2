So let us plan something incredible for them, this Christmas, I want you to be a Santa for your parents and make them proud by working hard. Imagine how happy they would be if you told them that: 

Even if I couldn't secure the grant, I have earned way more than this, and I promise to be consistent with my work! 

Let's do this and make their Christmas a stress-free one! Let's set a target for achieving 2 student application forms in the coming week. How do you think you can do that?
