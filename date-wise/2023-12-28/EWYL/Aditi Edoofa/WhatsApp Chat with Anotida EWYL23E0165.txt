As a concerned parent I want to assist my girl child in all her projects/assignments/activities related to this programme. Unfortunately  I haven't seen the projects referred to in this excerpt.  Can you please shed more light on that.

Hope you are well.

I appreciate your concern and commitment to supporting your girl child in her Edoofa program. The projects and assignments mentioned have already been discussed with her. The 3 projects were discussed in this group only out of which she is supposed to actively work on the 2 projects that is Community Building and African School Reform Mission. 
On the EWYL line there is a lesson sent every week that she has to go through and share her understanding about and an activity related to the lesson is shared on Saturday that she has to submit to upskill herself and there we also discuss her progress and efforts towards the projects.
