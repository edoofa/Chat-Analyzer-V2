23/12/23, 5:58 PM - +91 76819 66443: Greetings, My dearest and Lovely Mentor, Ms. Jasmine ❤️
I would like to extend my warm gratitude towards your best wishes for me for this Christmas holiday which is just around the corner. 

I really appreciate you for remembering me and wishing me a Merry Christmas. 
Ms. Jasmine, I'm wishing you a Merry Christmas too💫💃🤩

As we approach this great day with so much zeal, I'm also working hard in my Earn While You Learn Program. I have learnt so many lessons from you that encourage and motivate me to keep working hard towards my dreams. From the bottom of my heart I say, everything you have done so far for me has been nothing but wonderful 😊. 

I will be sharing some application forms soon. As of now, I am rounding off the students' application eligibility test to check if they have fully understood everything regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program before I submit their Application Forms.

Once again, Thank you so much for the Merry Christmas wishes, Ms. Jasmine 💝😊
