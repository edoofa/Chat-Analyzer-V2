27/12/23, 2:26 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Namwaka*
I am so happy to see that you came on time for the session. 

There is one thing that I wanted to share with you. Edoofa is organizing a fully sponsered industrial visit *for our students here in India*
Today I am a little occupied with the planning for the event so I would like to reschedule the session to tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm.

Kindly excuse me for the inconveniences caused but don't worry we will definitely make up for it tomorrow.
Have a nice day ahead. <This message was edited>
