I wanted to express my disappointment upon realizing that my last message went unanswered, specifically the question I posed at the end.

I provided you with a holiday to facilitate a focused and stress-free environment for your exams. However, I can't help but feel disheartened that a simple question seems to have been overlooked. I understand the demands of this period, but a basic acknowledgment or response would have sufficed.

It's a small but important detail that will contribute to your success. Is this not important to you?
