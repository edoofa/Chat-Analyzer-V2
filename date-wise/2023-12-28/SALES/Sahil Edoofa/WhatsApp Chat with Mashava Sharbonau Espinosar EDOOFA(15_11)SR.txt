L then proceeded to highschool level and started at Gwamure high where l managed to prosper in chess, debate and public speaking. Later on l transferred to Ngomayebani Sec in search of science subjects and that's where l wrote my O level and l passed 10 subjects out of 11. L then l proceeded to A level at Chrome high school, where l got 6 points in sciences i.e last year '2022'. 
So uh my field of interest is engineering and l want either aerospace engineering or mining engineering and my hobbies are playing chess or reading novels. 
My father is a teacher and my mother is not employed. So uh we are five in our family i.e our parents, me and my two elder sisters. Where we stayed was usually determined by where our father would be at that time until now we are living in Zvishavane Mapirimira in rural areas.

21/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh the first thing is that uh this program doesn't just take students simply because they are poor or needy but because of their attitude and talent. Furthermore, this program has advantages like making a student earn while learning, dominance of englidh so that everyone gets to communicate easier  , also if a student wants to study in other countries, Edoofa will ensure that it assists with necessary knowledge and give you the best career advice.

21/11/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What is the cost of Education abroad ?
21/11/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 11:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

22/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 557 0270: How are you today sir
22/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Uh...I'm not quite aware
22/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Ok uh l have made some research... countries like Germany, Norway, Argentina, India and Poland usually ranges between £2500 - £6000 per year
22/11/23, 2:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263775570270 Did you manage to go through this document ?
22/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Of course I did ...l thought you just meant like in general... costs on this document l saw them

22/11/23, 5:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So have you gone through the cost of Education abroad ?
22/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Yes l did
22/11/23, 8:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please share it with me ?
22/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh in India the average cost is $6000 -$8000 per year but because  of Edoofa program and due to its  $10 million scholarship fund, it can decrease up to $2000 - 3000 per year and that's why this program is considered the best because in countries like Germany, expenses ranges from $10 000 -$ 12 000 per year and for English taught courses, it's  $20 000 - $25 000. Also in China it's $6000 - $9000, so the way l see it , Edoofa has made it easier for students to live and study in India.
23/11/23, 11:55 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

23/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Ok uh  my father is the one who's been financially supporting me and he's a teacher at Govarizadze secondary.My school once charged us 50 Us per term
23/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh let me say l have great plans of changing the future for my country mainly in aeroplanes and mining area because the way l see it, my country is full of minerals but because of lack of advanced machinery we don't get to access those minerals and even on aeroplanes side, l also have a plan to open schools and industries of manufacturing aeroplanes so without me going abroad to access advanced technology and efficient knowledge, l won't be able to bring any of these visions to life unless l go abroad

24/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Ok uh the first thing is that all papers licked especially maths and chemistry, so if your answers looked familiar with those of marking schemes which had licked, you were penalized even if your school wasn't on the list of schools which had licked exams but also the issue that our physics teacher transferred when we were in form 6 so we had to finish the syllabus on our own, so basically that's what affected our stream.
24/11/23, 4:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: \These are your final results?
24/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Of course

As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
07/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Of course I am
07/12/23, 7:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please share with me ?
07/12/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 557 0270: On uh ain't those the ones you once shared with me on that document

08/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 557 0270: I'm alright...how are you sir
08/12/23, 4:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
08/12/23, 4:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

08/12/23, 9:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so let us connect at 10:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session     

Stay Blessed!
09/12/23, 12:36 am - +263 77 557 0270: Ok sure

How are you doing today?
13/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 557 0270: I'm alright sir..
13/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 557 0270: How are you
13/12/23, 12:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
13/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 557 0270: I'm doing good thanks...how are you
13/12/23, 1:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
13/12/23, 1:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That's great to know. Now, let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
13/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Uh not that much...is it the earn while you learn program
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

13/12/23, 1:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
13/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Of course this is going to benefit me a lot because basically l can not be 100% sure that my parents are going to afford this money every semester but with this EWYL program, I'm sure this is going to workout.
13/12/23, 4:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that @263775570270 , moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
13/12/23, 4:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

13/12/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Yes that's exactly what I have been looking forward to find regarding my international education...let's continue
13/12/23, 8:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
13/12/23, 8:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.

So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
13/12/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh...l really appreciate number 2 because the way l see it, these days you don't need to only have a theoritical approach but a practical approach in every skill that has to be done, whether it's a job or basically anything
14/12/23, 11:40 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
14/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 557 0270: I'm doing fine today
14/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 557 0270: How are you
14/12/23, 2:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now let me brief you on another benefit of the Edoofa Program.
As you know through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. But did you know that here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees as well.
 
Would you like me to explain how that happens?
14/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Yes you can explain
14/12/23, 2:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright so can you tell me what is the first thing you would be supposed to do when you wish to apply for a university
 
You buy an application form by paying the application fee, isn't it?
14/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Yes that's it...you buy buy an apple form
14/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 557 0270: ...an application form
14/12/23, 3:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you know how much the application fee is for an international student for any college on your own?
14/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 557 0270: No I'm not aware
14/12/23, 3:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well,if you research you will find that on an average Application Fee of a University is around $150-$200.So if you want to apply for 5 different colleges, you will have to pay the application fee for each college differently.So how much will the total expense be on just the application fee?
14/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 557 0270: It will be $750 -$2000 for 5 different colleges
14/12/23, 3:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: it would be around $750-$1000 but even if you apply to 5 colleges after paying the application fee, do they provide you any assurance whether you will be given admission or scholarship?
14/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Uh I'm not sure about that
14/12/23, 3:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: They don't give any assurance  and do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
 
But the real challenge is to get eligible. Do you think you are capable of this challenge?
14/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Yea l can try and be flexible with it
14/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 557 0270: So you don't apply to only one college, you have to apply to different colleges
14/12/23, 3:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: If you apply at one and you don't get any response from there will you waste your one year ?
14/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 557 0270: So usually the minimum number should be 3 or
14/12/23, 4:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same.
Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
14/12/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 557 0270: No l don't
14/12/23, 4:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.

 
This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!
 
So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it.
Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
14/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Of course I do now
14/12/23, 4:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
 How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
14/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 557 0270: The total amount will be $1350 - $2000
14/12/23, 4:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000. 

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
14/12/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright I got it
15/12/23, 11:02 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 557 0270: Ok I'm following
15/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 557 0270: Morning
15/12/23, 12:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
15/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Ok of course that will be flexible for African parents
15/12/23, 12:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: so now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
15/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Ok uh in brief let me say, Edoofa program is trying by all means to reduce amounts so that they become affordable for every student and by this it is reducing every amount from school fees  even up to application fee.So Edoofa is managing to make students pay their finances on their own by the EWYL program whereby students get to gain a practical approach on some jobs whilst earning money so that they reduce expenses for their parents
15/12/23, 2:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
15/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh l got it now
15/12/23, 3:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh for now we are in the phase 1, that is personalized counseling session and now we have discussed issues like fees, that is school and both application, EWYL program, admission process, advantages of the Edoofa and also it's background.
16/12/23, 12:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
18/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Hello afternoon
18/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 557 0270: I'm sorry uh these days network is really down
18/12/23, 2:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
18/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Of course...go ahead
18/12/23, 7:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
18/12/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright I got it...let's move on
18/12/23, 7:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your child’s counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
18/12/23, 7:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

19/12/23, 2:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Why are you late for the session ?
19/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh situation here in Africa is quite complicated worse off in rural areas...here l have to climb the mountain for better network so it's a disadvantage mostly when it's raining like these days...so at times l have to travel to the shops that is for about 7 to 8km on foot so that l can be able to communicate with you...so that's the story over here but l try by all means that l reach out to you and communicate
19/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I can understand.
19/12/23, 2:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
19/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh yesterday l cannot say we had time to discuss about the issue because during the week my father won't be home but Friday up to Sunday
19/12/23, 3:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

20/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Ok...got it
20/12/23, 12:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Correct question 4
20/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 557 0270: 'Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*'...

Maybe you can explain it again.
20/12/23, 3:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you elaborate your question ?
