30/11/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Surely, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
30/11/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
30/11/23, 2:12 pm - +44 7518 635114: That's great.
30/11/23, 2:16 pm - +44 7518 635114: What's the clear picture of sponsoring and what's not sponsored, 
When do programs start 
There is still much to learn from you, what and how things are done and when.
30/11/23, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: Firstly, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
30/11/23, 2:52 pm - +44 7518 635114: Well said.
What are the tuitions, and other expenses,
30/11/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: I would be discussing everything in detail as we proceed ahead please,

We have only started the counseling session please.
30/11/23, 3:00 pm - +44 7518 635114: OK,sorry for going ahead of the discussion.
30/11/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please
30/11/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Tapuwa, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mr Isaiah better as parent. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - +44 7518 635114: I will come,after Mr Isaiah.
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: You can address for both please

02/12/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So what motivates him to study Social work, Mrs Tapuwa?
02/12/23, 12:25 pm - +44 7518 635114: He has passion in working with the vulnerables.
He is fully convinced that working with people and trying to give solutions to their problems will be a suitable profession for him.
He loves problem solving and making things work for everyone.
02/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: That's well thought off, Mrs Tapuwa.

He surely has a kind heart.
02/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
02/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
02/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
02/12/23, 12:38 pm - +44 7518 635114: Thank you for the clarification,
I am still reading and digesting and hope Brian you are doing the same please so as the father.
It looks to be a well informed  piece of information.
I am reading.
Thank you.
02/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please.

You can read and let me know.
02/12/23, 12:47 pm - +44 7518 635114: OK,thank you.
02/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome please
02/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Do you now have a better understanding of how Social work and Sociology are similar?
02/12/23, 3:56 pm - +44 7518 635114: Yes ,now I understand thanks.
02/12/23, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: Good evening Mrs Tapuwa.
02/12/23, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted

04/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: *Bachelor in Psychology - Bachelor in Psychology* is a 3-year undergraduate course.

*What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*

In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.

 *What is it about?*

Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.

BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.

04/12/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through all the resources, Brian?

If so, did you find them interesting and helpful?
04/12/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Kindly ensure active participation please.
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 198 8615: Yaaa
04/12/23, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you did,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
04/12/23, 4:13 pm - +44 7518 635114: Not at all,
Kindly educate us on this.
04/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Surely Mrs Tapuwa.
04/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/12/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/12/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/12/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation please.
04/12/23, 4:43 pm - +44 7518 635114: Thank you for clarifying.
What is the cost I'd a child do not qualify and is not selected for the program.?
What are the flight fares there?
Is it possible for a student to come back to visit annually?
04/12/23, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/12/23, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: You only proceed ahead with the program if Brian qualifies please.
04/12/23, 4:52 pm - +44 7518 635114: Thank you,meaning to say,the students have the opportunity to work and earn money as they study? Besides the reduced tuitions?
04/12/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, please!
04/12/23, 5:02 pm - +44 7518 635114: OK,in which fields do they work?
In their area of study or out of programs studied
04/12/23, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: Let me share more details about the Earn While You Learn Program.
04/12/23, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/12/23, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/12/23, 6:03 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

04/12/23, 6:05 pm - +44 7518 635114: Thank you for more information you are providing us with.
04/12/23, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
04/12/23, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/12/23, 6:29 pm - +44 7518 635114: Received with thanks Ms Harmehak.
04/12/23, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please.
04/12/23, 7:02 pm - +44 7518 635114: I see,thank you.
04/12/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

So far, do you have any queries Mrs Tapuwa?
04/12/23, 7:53 pm - +44 7518 635114: No, I do not have any queries now.
If I sense any, I will come back to ask.
Thank you.
04/12/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
04/12/23, 7:57 pm - +44 7518 635114: I can squeeze the time. 
I have pending tasks at the moment.
04/12/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Tapuwa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
04/12/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/12/23, 8:09 pm - +44 7518 635114: Noted with thanks.
It will be a lot of money if applications are sent to various universities.
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/12/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Tapuwa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/12/23, 8:12 pm - +44 7518 635114: Okay,
So what's the deadline for the payments
04/12/23, 8:12 pm - +44 7518 635114: I appreciate that.
04/12/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: The fee of $350 is paid in installments after Brian is found eligible for the program and receives an acceptance letter.
04/12/23, 8:13 pm - +44 7518 635114: Thats fine.
04/12/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/12/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/12/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/12/23, 8:19 pm - +44 7518 635114: That's clear,
04/12/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful
04/12/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
04/12/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
04/12/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/12/23, 8:22 pm - +44 7518 635114: Yaà,but I need to read again
04/12/23, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please
04/12/23, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/12/23, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
04/12/23, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
04/12/23, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 8:29 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
04/12/23, 8:29 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

04/12/23, 11:01 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
04/12/23, 11:01 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/12/23, 11:01 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

05/12/23, 12:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
05/12/23, 12:29 pm - +44 7518 635114: Thank you and nice to have you online, Sahil
05/12/23, 12:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
05/12/23, 12:35 pm - +44 7518 635114: Yes, although I still need to register long texts and read them with much analysis.
Otherwise the basics were successfully deliberated.
05/12/23, 12:35 pm - +44 7518 635114: revist*
05/12/23, 1:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: ​​May I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members, and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?
05/12/23, 1:28 pm - +44 7518 635114: We are still to discuss this on weekend face to face, or on a three way call and share sentiments on the overall discussion.
05/12/23, 2:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
05/12/23, 9:05 pm - +44 7518 635114: I was preoccupied today ,I am sorry.

My apologies.

I got the assurance that it is  possible to send a child there.

05/12/23, 11:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
05/12/23, 11:45 pm - +44 7518 635114: That's true, I share the same sentiments with you.
It is possible to study with Edoofa scholarship.
05/12/23, 11:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!

20/12/23, 1:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you ready for the same ?
20/12/23, 1:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer using voice notes ?
20/12/23, 1:29 pm - +44 7518 635114: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 1:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/12/23, 1:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
20/12/23, 1:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
20/12/23, 1:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 1:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th    or 27 th December 2023 for $200 and the 26th    or 27 th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th    or 27 th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
20/12/23, 2:25 pm - +44 7518 635114: I will opt for rhe first one where I would complete  the payment of 200 dollars in 7 days and the remaining 150 dollars un 30 days.
20/12/23, 2:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer using voice notes please?
20/12/23, 2:47 pm - +44 7518 635114: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: since you have answered all the questions, now a video call would be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Brian's application. 

Shall I get you the slots for tomorrow?
20/12/23, 3:57 pm - +44 7518 635114: Noted with thanks.
Just a quick question please, who is supposed to be video called? I mean, parent or the student?

26/12/23, 8:11 am - Sahil Edoofa: @263781988615 @447721421925 @447518635114 Good Morning 
How are you doing today ?
26/12/23, 10:42 am - +44 7518 635114: We are good thank you.
26/12/23, 11:32 am - Sahil Edoofa: So do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
26/12/23, 2:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are we connected?
26/12/23, 5:28 pm - +44 7518 635114: Yes we are,it's only that we were  occupied with Xmas celebrations
26/12/23, 6:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
26/12/23, 6:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-
