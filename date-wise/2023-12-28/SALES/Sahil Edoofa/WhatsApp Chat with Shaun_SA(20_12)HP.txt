20/12/23, 10:13 am - +27 68 272 6969: My apologies where your prospective student Shaun is now and her Mother there are struggling with network , so what are the requirements for enrollment
20/12/23, 10:17 am - +27 68 272 6969: Shaun is waiting for Cambridge university A level results coming out in January or early February
20/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: I do understand please
20/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Since currently we have just begun with the counseling session,

I shall discuss everything in detail.
20/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
20/12/23, 10:19 am - +27 68 272 6969: Thank you
20/12/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Musendo, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mrs Musendo better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
20/12/23, 11:28 am - +27 68 272 6969: First and foremost Me and Shaun's mother, we don't stay together but we want the best for our son .
I am a qualified Electrician, National certificate in electrical power engineering obtained in 1999 and his mother has executive secretarial course . Having grown up in a family where education was not prioritised I realised the importance of education when I became a first generation student. I am testament of how education can change your life .Without it  I doubt if I was going to be able to soldier on to support him to reach this stage of sitting for A level exams, a family milestone.

Having witnessed many people succumb to lack of technical knowledge for  example layman electrician electrocuted because of lack of basic knowledge , I don't want the same fate for my son.I believe tertiary education equips you  with most skills needed to navigate the rough path of life , Apparently Edoofa scholarship program will equip you with these important skills while ensuring that you are ahead of counterparts
20/12/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mr Musendo, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
20/12/23, 1:10 pm - +27 68 272 6969: The pleasure is mine, Thank you
20/12/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: By when shall I expect to hear from Mrs Plaxedes please?
20/12/23, 2:03 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Anytime soon when She is where the network is available, definitely she will communicate and I do appreciate
20/12/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please!
20/12/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, may I know Shaun better as a student,

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies please?
20/12/23, 3:37 pm - +27 68 272 6969: There is a problem with electricity where they are staying , phone off ,not charged that is why I can't get hold of them, I am so stressed now
20/12/23, 4:03 pm - +27 68 272 6969: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:08 pm - +27 68 272 6969: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:09 pm - +27 68 272 6969: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
20/12/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: Received please, I can see he received great remarks from his teachers!
20/12/23, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: So what exactly would he like to study for his higher education in India, Mr Musendo?
20/12/23, 4:21 pm - +27 68 272 6969: BSc/MIDR medical imaging (diagnostic radiography)
20/12/23, 4:25 pm - +27 68 272 6969: 2nd preference civil engineering
3rd computer science majoring in artificial intelligence
20/12/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, Mr Musendo.

Considering the first interest in Medicine,

May I know why he didn't pursue Biology in his A level please?
20/12/23, 4:44 pm - +27 68 272 6969: It was me who made him, to drop biology for physics
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
20/12/23, 5:00 pm - +27 68 272 6969: He did Maths, physics and chemistry
20/12/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
20/12/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: Having shared the same, he is eligible for Civil Engineering as well.
20/12/23, 5:38 pm - +27 68 272 6969: He did biology at ordinary level
20/12/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

However here in India, A level subjects are a primary requirement.
20/12/23, 5:41 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Okay
20/12/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same please?
20/12/23, 5:44 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Yes I did, tomorrow Shaun will be available for career guidance
20/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Surely Mr Musendo.

So far, do you have any queries for me?
20/12/23, 5:46 pm - +27 68 272 6969: The scholarship is it, 100% funded
20/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of 100% funded please?
20/12/23, 5:49 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Does the scholarship cover tuition fees, accommodation, food, medical and travel expenses
20/12/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
20/12/23, 5:55 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Thank you for letting me know the difference and with his A level combination is he eligible for Computer science
20/12/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!

Yes please, he is eligible, Mr Musendo.
20/12/23, 6:00 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Tomorrow Shaun will be in the place where the network is available and we'll continue with our conversation and hear from him what he wants to do, thank you very much for your time and patience
20/12/23, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please

I wish you all a blessed evening ahead
20/12/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: The discussion for tomorrow is scheduled at 9 AM CAT
20/12/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile do go through the shared video to learn more about the experience of our Proud Edoofians.
20/12/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:12 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Shaun you may chat with Ms Harmehak we have been waiting for you
20/12/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 555 7237: I already did
21/12/23, 9:08 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Saturday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/12/23, 6:17 pm - +27 68 272 6969: This message was deleted
21/12/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Good day everyone..... I hope you are all doin well.... I am sincerely sorry for having missed all my sessions....

23/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Were you able to follow the discussion regarding your course and fields, Shaun?
23/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 555 7237: Yess I was
23/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 555 7237: & saw that I am not eligible for what I really wanted
23/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Yes please, since Biology is a crucial requirement.
23/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: What is your take on discussion so far along with the course that you are eligible to opt for?
23/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 555 7237: Well I can't say that I am happy with the discussion since I really wanted a degree associated with medical Physics
23/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding Medical Physics?
23/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 555 7237: Well I have always had an interest in medicine eversince.... & Looking at the subjects I was doing , I then told myself that I would pursue a medical degree which  is aligned with physics as I was doing physics without biology
23/12/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Alright please, 

And what motivates you to study Medical Physics, Shaun?
23/12/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 555 7237: What motivates me ... Let's see

There are many things that motivates me into studying medical physics....for instance the desire to improve the health and well-being of others.... I researched more into it & found out that Medical physicists play an important role in developing new treatments and technologies that can save lives and improve quality of life.

 I personally also like the challenge and intellectual stimulation of studying physics and applying it to medicine... &  it's the opportunity to work in a field that is constantly evolving and advancing
23/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 555 7237: Studying medical physics gives me a wide range of career opportunities ... Medical physicists can work in hospitals, research labs, government agencies, and private companies. They can also work in a variety of sub-fields, such as radiation oncology, diagnostic imaging, and nuclear medicine......So yes it made me realize that medical physics is a relatively stable and secure field, with good job prospects and also competitive salaries. 😌
23/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 555 7237: So my interests are mainly within those sub-fields
23/12/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Shaun.

I can see you are well researched as well, however do you have a brief understanding that what you wish to study is exactly what *Bachelor in Pharmacy and Bachelor of science in medical laboratory Technology* does offer?
23/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 555 7237: I didn't look much into those in particular
23/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Were you facing any challenge due to which you couldn't follow through please?
23/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Yess I did

23/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 555 7237: & by comparing the two I was also able to conclude on which is aligned more with medical physics & which would most likely give me a better income than the other
23/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Thank u for briefing me on the two... I did not know much about them
23/12/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: That's great
23/12/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: So which one would you like to opt for, Shaun?
23/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Well I guess in this case I would have to opt for A bachelor in pharmacy
23/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So before you make a thorough decision,

Do you have any queries for me?
23/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Not really
23/12/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright Shaun, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Well I see myself quite educated if I were to get into the Edoofa program since India is the home to some of the world's best universities and research institutions....   India can be a great way for me to gain quality education, gain experience, and launch a successful career.
23/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 555 7237: From the introduction u gave us I was able to conclude that India is home to a growing number of international companies and organizations, which means that there are many career opportunities for graduates.
23/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 555 7237: That being said.... I feel  confident that I will be able to achieve my dreams
23/12/23, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Shaun, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Haha thought u wouldn't ask

Well .. There are many reasons why I would want to study abroad For starters there are better educational opportunities in other countries.... better quality of education, the range of courses available and the level of research and also innovation can all be higher in other countries. Additionally, studying abroad can provide valuable cultural experiences and open up new career opportunities.... Anything is possible these days
23/12/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Shaun, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
23/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Okay sure .... Well what I managed to research & find out about the Indian education in particular is that... 
the Indian education system is very diverse and complex..  Many universities in India offer bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. There are also many specialized schools, including medical schools, engineering schools, and law schools. The quality of education varies depending on the institution, but overall, the Indian education system is well regarded and produces many successful students....

Quality wise... Its impressive as compared to my country 
The quality of education in India is quite high. The country has some of the top universities....These institutions have very high standards and are known for accredits and evaluaIndian students are very well-educated and have a strong work ethic....

So In India achieving my dreams would be easier than in my country
23/12/23, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: Good afternoon Shaun,

23/12/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/12/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please
23/12/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Yess we are
23/12/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright, can you please share with me as well?
23/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 555 7237: The approximate cost of similar quality education?
23/12/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
23/12/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Well let's take countries like the USA.... When I last looked up on their annual fees it was around $20 000 to $50 000
23/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Australian universities sightly cheaper but almost the same range... Around $20 000 to $30 000
23/12/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Duly received, Shaun
23/12/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/12/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/12/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/12/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Understood
23/12/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
23/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 555 7237: I suppose the earn while you learn program makes it a bit  easier on both the parents & student 
The student can cover up on some living expenses & also help in covering their education

Plus I think it gives a student an opportunity to build connections with some employers, which might make it easier for the student to look for employment right after graduation
23/12/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Shaun

I appreciate your appreciation for the Earn While You Learn Program.
23/12/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: Shaun, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
23/12/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 555 7237: I have a friend who is on his third year..... The prices are quite accurate ....I definitely agree with you on this one
23/12/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Shaun!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
23/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Yess I definitely an
23/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Am*
23/12/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
23/12/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/12/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/12/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

23/12/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 555 7237: The EWYL really makes life easy for international students
23/12/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
23/12/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Understood👌Thank you
23/12/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/12/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Yesss I can conclude that your program try's by all means to make learning affordable for the students as they receive quality education
23/12/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please,

Did you thoroughly follow the shared resources?
23/12/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Still goin through
23/12/23, 6:11 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

You would definitely have a great understanding.
23/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Sorry I am facing problems in downloading the video ... Can we proceed though as I keep on trying
23/12/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please,

You can go through it after we complete the discussion.
23/12/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: So Shaun, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
23/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Yess
23/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Please
23/12/23, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: Shaun, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/12/23, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Approximately a minimum of$1500
23/12/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/12/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/12/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: You see, Shaun, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/12/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 555 7237: I guess it's a bit costly at first only.... As we include the money to join the Edoofa program & the fees
23/12/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Is that correct
23/12/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate or rephrase, Shaun?
23/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 555 7237: To be part of the Edoofa program. ..... It's $350 is that correct?
23/12/23, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, however that's not for you to be a part of the Edoofa Program

It's an enrollment fee.

*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/12/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Okay I see
23/12/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: You pay after being accepted into the program which is after you are found eligible and receiving an acceptance letter.
23/12/23, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/12/23, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/12/23, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: I hope now you understand even better, Shaun?
23/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 555 7237: May I ask what is the minimum requirement of points for a student to be part of Edoofa program
23/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Yess thank you
23/12/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
23/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Isn't a minimum of 2 A level passes  6 points?...
23/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: No please.
23/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/12/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Okay
23/12/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Please?
23/12/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Understood
23/12/23, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/12/23, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/12/23, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

23/12/23, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/12/23, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

23/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

26/12/23, 2:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
26/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 555 7237: I like the idea of how it is so broad
26/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 555 7237: As it covers a wide range of disciplines and specialties.
26/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Thank you
26/12/23, 3:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So does the course aligns with your career aspirations ?
26/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Yess sir... I am quite fimilar with Civil Engineering
26/12/23, 3:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Noted have changed your course .
26/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Thank you so much
26/12/23, 3:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
26/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Not really. .. we managed to make introductions .. I failed to talk with her more due to power cut......
26/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 555 7237: However, She have me a brief summary of everything Ms. Harmehak told me
26/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 555 7237: She gave* me
26/12/23, 4:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Make sure parents have a call today , You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
26/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Okay
26/12/23, 4:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!

26/12/23, 5:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, this year over 1700 students and parents attended this session, So now I would like to hear from you, as your parents are they willing to support you to the fullest so that you, can work hard and be a part of the Edoofa Program for further intake?
26/12/23, 5:10 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Yes we're committed
26/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Yes they are committed
26/12/23, 6:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
26/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 555 7237: 1.Civil Engineering
2.India
3.$6000-$8000
4.$2000-$3000
5.$350
6.7 days However, if parents are  facing challenges parents can complete part fees $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days
7.yes I am
26/12/23, 7:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
26/12/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 555 7237: Yess they are
26/12/23, 7:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can they acknowledge in this group ?
26/12/23, 7:42 pm - +27 68 272 6969: Yes we will acknowledge busy calculating the budget
26/12/23, 7:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
26/12/23, 7:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
26/12/23, 7:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
26/12/23, 7:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 7:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 1st or 2nd January 2024 for $200 and the 1st or 2nd of February  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 1st or 2nd January. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
26/12/23, 9:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
