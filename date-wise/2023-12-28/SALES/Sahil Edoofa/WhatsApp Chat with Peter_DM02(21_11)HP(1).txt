22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 123 5925: good morning to you Mam
22/11/23, 9:07 am - Harmehak: Mr Bernard, now as we proceed, I would like to know Peter better as a student.

It's a pleasure to know more him and his interests in computers.
22/11/23, 9:45 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
22/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 123 5925: Yes i am very confident with his performance
22/11/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: Wonderful!

On that note let me brief you about his desired course that is *Bachelor of science in computer science*
22/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 123 5925: Yes Sir
22/11/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: *B.Sc.

22/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 123 5925: thats Great to know this thank you
22/11/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mr Bernard.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
22/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 123 5925: no not all
22/11/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 123 5925: but i just heard it from the social media that its very expensive such that an ordinary person like me can not afford it so we dont even bother try to find how much it is because i wont afford
22/11/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: I can understand please!
22/11/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 123 5925: okay i understand
22/11/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 123 5925: is it required once off payment or its paid per semester?
22/11/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Per semester please.
22/11/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
22/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 123 5925: okay i support the Earn While You Learn Program its a good initiative for cutting down the fees
22/11/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: I am glad
22/11/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Mr Bernard, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
22/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 123 5925: Ummm i beg to differ a bit because it all depends with some options ,it varies
22/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 123 5925: but its around there
22/11/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: I understand
22/11/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Indeed,

So having gone through the costs of international education for Peter being offered by the Edoofa program, are you in a better position to relate how we are making it affordable and accessible for international students?

Given the opportunity like Earn While You Learn Program as well
22/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 123 5925: Yes Edoofa is making international education very very affordable and accessible for international students.Especially with the Earn While You Learn Program
22/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 123 5925: i really via for the facility
22/11/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/11/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/11/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 123 5925: i understand
22/11/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 123 5925: Okay thats awesome
22/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Mr Bernard
22/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 123 5925: ok i am getting your explanation
22/11/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries please?
22/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 123 5925: Yes i just want to ask if those students under the earn while you learn program are not finding it  difficult to balance school work and working for scholarship credits?
22/11/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: No please, as they participate in the programs during their free time.

They are alloted a dedicated mentor while they are still in Zimbabwe till the end of their course who assists them throughout with their projects and other requirements.
22/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 123 5925: okay i understand
22/11/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/11/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 123 5925: yes i have realised
22/11/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 123 5925: Thank you for clarifying this to me
22/11/23, 11:53 am - Harmehak: That is great, Mr Bernard, 

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes only. 

Are you ready?
22/11/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 123 5925: yes
22/11/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Mr Bernard, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
22/11/23, 11:54 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 123 5925: between $1500 -$2250
22/11/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/11/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/11/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mr Bernard, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
22/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 123 5925: I can notice that
22/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
22/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 123 5925: okay i understand
22/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 123 5925: its clear
22/11/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/11/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
22/11/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 123 5925: Sorry you mean to say all the above steps can be undertaken only when you have fully paid $350 is that so?
22/11/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: No please.
22/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 123 5925: okay before payment?
22/11/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: You pay $350 in two parts at Stage 2,

Which is after/if Peter is accepted into to the program only.
22/11/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: You would be going through interview stage to see if Peter qualifies please.
22/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 123 5925: okay
22/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 123 5925: understand
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 123 5925: okay its clear on this stage
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 123 5925: okay thank you  for linking me up with her  , i think she will clarify more to me through the experience she had with assistance from Edoofa scholsrship program.
22/11/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mr Bernard
22/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 123 5925: ok thank you
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 12:30 PM CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2. He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

23/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 123 5925: Yes

23/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 123 5925: Does that list comes from the current lower six students at Daramombe or it's coming from upper six.i asked this because my child  is still in lower six

23/11/23, 2:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: We also have students from L6 even today one student reserved her seat , Her name is Jacquline.
23/11/23, 2:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
23/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 123 5925: If the list comes from loer six students i would like to reserve  the scholarship seat for my Peter ,but how do i go abaout it?
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 123 5925: yes i have talked to her yesterday after reference from Mam i was chatting with during yesterday's session
23/11/23, 3:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Yes please
23/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
23/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 123 5925: 1.Computer Science.
23/11/23, 3:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Inform me once you are done .
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 123 5925: 2.India    3.  An range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000* with the average cost of a 4-year degree  program.4    $2000-$3000 per year.5.$350.00    6. 7 days.    *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you ready for the same ?
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 123 5925: yes i am ready but i will get $150 in the following month that is Dec and i will pay the remainder within 30 days after the day of deposit of the $150
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 28th or 29th November 2023 for $200 and the 28th or 29th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 28th or 29th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
23/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 123 5925: i am not yet financially geared up since i was thinking that its for the year 2025.maybe you can give me more time to look for money to make the deposit of $200
23/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 123 5925: Since i am much willing for the program i will definitely come back to you sir as soon as i get ready
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Peter's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways

*1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

*2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:-* Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

*3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
23/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: This is the reason why *Jacquline Tendai Chipadza and Chelsie D Muchingami* reserved their seats today itself as we are left with very few seats now .
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 123 5925: ok i understand the above explanation let me run around i will come to you as soon i can

24/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 123 5925: I worried at the moment I m not financially challenged
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Peter's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Peter's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 123 5925: I am financially challenge but maybe next week I will be ready
24/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 123 5925: Yes I will opt for this one thank you for standing on my side

02/12/23, 12:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
Kindly excuse me for the delay I was in a meeting with the academic board.

So shall we start your session now ?
04/12/23, 11:50 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning@263775313011 
How are you doing today? @263771235925 @
04/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 531 3011: Morning
04/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 123 5925: Good and you
04/12/23, 1:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
04/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 123 5925: Yes u can
04/12/23, 3:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
04/12/23, 3:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
