 I learned that Edoofa scholarship program caters  for those students who want to proceed with their tertiary education in lndia. Students  also get to engage in projects that are aimed at. career and skill development through Earn While You learn program .



I want to be accepted into the Edoofa program because it has a lot of beneficiaries. One can engage in projects that are aimed at career and skill development along with Earn While You learn program. lt has been my dream since childhood to study in lndia because l'm fond of those Indian movies and their festivals.  ln so doing in trying to pursue my tertiary education l will be fulfilling my dream.
