27/12/23, 3:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Chisaka, As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
27/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 326 9699: That depends on the amount required but will try my level best though  l don't think l will manage to make full payments at once
27/12/23, 3:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
27/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 326 9699: Yes
27/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 326 9699: Ok thanks for that

27/12/23, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms Chisaka, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
