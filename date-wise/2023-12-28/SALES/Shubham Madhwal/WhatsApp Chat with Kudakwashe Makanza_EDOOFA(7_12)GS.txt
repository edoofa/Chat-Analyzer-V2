08/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 697 5377: thank you Sir
08/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Kudakwashe, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Fungai, is that correct?
08/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 697 5377: No l got to know about the Edoofa Program from Simbarashe or James .
08/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Simbarashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Simbarashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 697 5377: So Edoofa is a revolutionionary intiative that aims to provide education opportunities to underprivileged and deserving students across the glode .  
Some of the benefits of Edoofa are that it offers internships and industry oriented training through live projects
* Students have a lifelong alumni membership and opportunities for employment and outplace.
 *Edoofa has EWYL  which helps students to get internship opportunities from influential organisations, they also gain experience and Skill building.
Simbarashe's journey with Edoofa have been nothing but great . Edoofa helped him since day 1 and upto now . They have been taking care of him even in  hard times .
08/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Great answer, Kudakwashe.
08/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes it is
08/12/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Kudakwashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
08/12/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes l think l have what it takes.
08/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Now Kudakwashe, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

09/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,
Excuse me for the delay as I was in a board meeting.

Let us continue the session.
09/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 236 8597: Hello
09/12/23, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: Hello, Mrs.Nyachowe, how are you?
09/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 697 5377: Ready to continue
09/12/23, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Sc. Agriculture*
09/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 236 8597: Ooh ok
09/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 697 5377: Noted  . That would be great
09/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
09/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 697 5377: Very confident about achieving it  Sir.
09/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the program?
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes Sir
09/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Go ahead Sir...
09/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Kudakwashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
09/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Noted ✅.
09/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
09/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
09/12/23, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

09/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Thank you Mr Gurvinder for your time . I will definitely go through the links .
11/12/23, 7:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/12/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 697 5377: Good morning, Everyone!.
11/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 236 8597: Morning everyone
11/12/23, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?* <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 697 5377: Yes l think this will benefit me
11/12/23, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Kudakwashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 697 5377: Earn while You Earn help s a student as they get internship opportunities from influential organizations
*It helps a student to self finance their education  .
* Provides Practical experience
*Students get a chance to lead a student group or mentor young students.
*Helps a student to build Skills as Webinars help them break into a great carrer.
11/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
11/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
11/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 697 5377: That's exactly what I was looking for regarding my international education.
11/12/23, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: Alright Kudakwashe, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
11/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 697 5377: Yes they will be supporting me for my higher education.
11/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
11/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes we did .
11/12/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
11/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Yes we are in  team
11/12/23, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Nyachowe, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 697 5377: The student will end up spending $ 2 250
11/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes l am.
11/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Yaa that's a lot of money.....
11/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs Nyachowe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Noted.
11/12/23, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 697 5377: I  think so.
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Kudakwashe basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Noted✅.
11/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: @263786975377 Are we still connected?
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 697 5377: No am not
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes we are Mr Gurvinder
11/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Yes now we are connected....eish the network sometimes is down.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263786975377 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes l do understood  the process
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 697 5377: So how do we start the Phase 2.
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6. outdo
A) NO CHANGE
B) defeat
C) outperform

What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide .

The Rwanda  Genocide occurred between 7 April and 15 July 1994 during the Rwanda civil war . During this period of around 100 days , members of the Tusti minority ethic group , as well as so moderate Huta and Twa were killed .Over 800,000 people up to 1 million were brutally slaughtered leaving the once- beautiful country in ruins . Rape and other forms of violence were directed primarily to women. 16 years following the Rwanda Genocide survivors and their families to present with considerable rates of PTSD and substantial depressive and anxiety symptoms.Thousands of children were orphaned and had to fend for themselves. Countless survives developed long term psychological problems how ever Rwanda Rebuilt it Self and survivors played an important role in it's development. Residents of Rwanda  enjoyed a low corruption rate and high quality of life ,making the country an ideal location for innovative ideals ,research and exploration . East to West and North to South the road infrastructure is impressive and continue  to expand . They are multiple super markets  over a dozen international ATMs .Access to electricity and running water ,both inconsistent for many years even those who could pay for it . Industries are being build there even one of the world largest Methane extractions .Hotels being built everywhere and real some sector is emerging to meet heightened tourism demand. Wireless broad band is being built out across the country. More restaurants are opening ,as are Universities , technical schools and pre-schools . Their second national language has shifted from French to English and the country country has joined the British Commonwealth. Against this impressive backdrop , crashing poverty still affects about 40 % of the population. Millions live on tiny plots of land scarcely capable of producing adequate food for families in which the average women gives birth to six children increasing population growth.In response the Rwanda government embarked on an ambitious programs to promote family planning but population momentum takes years to slow .The overpopulation issue is resulting in land degradation ( the gradually deterioration of agricultural lands and forest reserves due mainly to human activities). There was high youth unemployment rates and overdependence on the government. Rwanda people have no access to the capital. Several parts of Rwanda are subject to periodic droughts, while the El Nino phenomenon has increased the scale and scope of floods . Deforestation and destruction farming practise have also increased the impact of floods and slides 

"My Inspirational Story "

Once upon a time . In darkness not in times of shine . There was a boy named Sam who lived with his parents . His father had passed away when he was 4 ,so Sam didn't know how it feels to have a Father .To add insult to injury Sam was raised in a poor family . His mother was a a vendor in a small village called Chivi. Sam didn't go to school because there was no money. Sam started to help his mother to sell fruits and vegetables around for him to go to school .Living in a town were inflation started rising , Sam's money wasn't enough to pay fees so Same dropped out of School . He then went to live with his grandfather at the Farm . He started learning to work at the farm helping his grandfather with the knowledge he head from school  . The grew Vegetables and they supplied them to the local market. Unfortunately the area was hit by a servire drought and their business stoped . Sam's grandfather told him to never lost hope and to work hard . After two years of famine , Sam and his grandfather practiced irrigation farming .Sadly his grandfather had a stroke , he then started to take care of him whiles working in the field .His grandfather always told him that money was in the ground and Sam believed that . Sam worked very hard in the fields and he started to supply again fresh vegetables to the supermarket. He employed 10 people as his business was growing and flourishing to practice intensive farming and started to make higher profits .Sam had now money to finish his studies and change his family's story  . He became the best vegetable supplier in his town .Sam became a very  successful person and he owned 3 big producing farms in his province . He employed over 500 employees. He also opened an organisation that's pays school fees to under privileged students . So they say  "The very thing you a begging for  at the front are usually at the back ". <This message was edited>

19/12/23, 9:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to identify and choose from the one she wishes to study at.
19/12/23, 10:15 am - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you understand better now?
19/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 236 8597: Ooh ok Sir
19/12/23, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would like to ask?
19/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Good Afternoon ,  Everyone !
19/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes , how about the traveling expenses from Zimbabwe to India.
19/12/23, 3:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
19/12/23, 3:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cover the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
19/12/23, 3:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also acquire the visa with ease.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $400-$600, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preperations
19/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Very well noted✅
19/12/23, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrolment fees payment deadline mentioned in Kudakwashe's letter?
19/12/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Enrollment fees dead line  is 24December
19/12/23, 4:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: And are yoou aware of the Transaction Methods as well?
19/12/23, 5:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected?
19/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Yes Sir.... very much aware of the transaction method
19/12/23, 5:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
19/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 236 8597: The second one ....depositing into your associate account
19/12/23, 6:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.
19/12/23, 6:17 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe


The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

I personally have been helping students for the last 4 and a half years, and when I say that, with a little bit of my own experience, I personally feel there is actually something else which is the real concern over here!
22/12/23, 1:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Why don't you honestly share the real query with me, because there is surely something else which is a matter of concern right now?
22/12/23, 1:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Don't be hesitant to share what is going on, because if you would not communicate, I am not a God who would understand what is going on in your mind without you even sharing it with me.

Please don't get me wrong but this is not the first time I am counselling any student, I have been doing the same for the past 4 and half years. I can see that you all are facing certain apprehensions and concerns about the scholarship process which you are not clearly sharing with me and hence are going inactive during your sessions for the same reason.
23/12/23, 2:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *I also understand the financial commitment and hardships it takes for a parent to educate their child. But because of that, you cannot neglect the importance of quality education. Knowing the situation back there in Africa, the majority of students after completing their bachelor's degree have no guarantee of employment security.* <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 2:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This is a festive season for you all in which your entire family would gather around to celebrate. So I would request you all to take some time out for your child's education. Because inside you all know how this opportunity could benefit in shaping your child's career. Do give it a thought and note down all your concerns. *So that once we connect for our next session on Monday, at 08;00 AM CAT. then you can share the same with me and I could assist you accordingly to the best of my abilities.*
