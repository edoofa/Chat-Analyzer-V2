Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/12/23, 12:13 pm - +260 97 4435010: So according to what I have seen in the group discussion...I think this is a scholarship program that is helping learners persue in different courses provided by the university especially African countries
12/12/23, 12:22 pm - +260 97 4435010: And the other thing is that we need good results which are credit or better
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - +260 97 4435010: It also deals with private institutions that offer scholarships in india
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes sir/madam
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 4435010: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - +260 97 4435010: Thank you for the information and the programs u are offering is exactly what I want
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: It is Sir.
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Simposo, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +260 97 4435010: Oh sorry
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes I do sir

12/12/23, 2:24 pm - +260 97 7932921: Good afternoon sir, this is Mr Mwaangwa the father to Simposo. Kindly accept my apologies for coming in late. This is due to family engengements which pressed us urgently. However, My and I are now available to answer and support our daughter for any further assignments relating to the subject matter
12/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Good afternoon, Mr. Mwaangwa! No need to apologize; family engagements take priority. It's wonderful to have you here to support Simposo.

According to my expertise, the following courses will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

For Muchindu : *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering*
For Simposo : *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
15/12/23, 10:15 am - +260 97 4435010: So what's your say about this.....we change our courses or...
15/12/23, 11:02 am - Gurvinder: Simposo, you wanted to do management accounting and international finance, right?
15/12/23, 11:02 am - +260 97 4435010: Yes sir
15/12/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: So that is why I have offered you the course of B.com.
15/12/23, 11:03 am - +260 97 4435010: Y can't someone start with a degree without a bachelor
15/12/23, 11:03 am - +260 97 4435010: Ohhh alright
15/12/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: Bachelor of Commerce is an University degree only, Simposo.
15/12/23, 11:04 am - +260 97 4435010: Ohh I understand
15/12/23, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: And for Muchindi, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their Grade 12 which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.

A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.
15/12/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.
15/12/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*
15/12/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

15/12/23, 11:20 am - Gurvinder: Since you both have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
15/12/23, 11:20 am - +260 97 4435010: Sorry sir
15/12/23, 11:34 am - +260 97 7825680: In the next five years if given the chance of the scholarship I see myself becoming a great engineer. An engineer who is creative and innovative 
Immediately after completion I would also like to work under employment at least two years to gain experience to those engineers who heve succeeded in this field
If given the chance to get into Edoofa's Program it will help me see how other countries are performing in terms of advancement. In other ways it will help me learn from engineers abroad and it will broaden my understanding.
Further more I won't only have knowledge about engineering which I locally see in Zambia but also that which is out of Africa. I see it help widen my mindset of how things are done out there
15/12/23, 11:36 am - +260 97 4435010: First of...me getting into this EDOOFA program can  be like a dream come true because I have always wanted to study from India because I know you offer very good courses that can enable one to get the kind of job they would want and achieve their dreams.I think 5years after the completion of the course can really make me a successful woman and manage the affairs of my work profession.I also think that after 5years of completion and Archivement and I would like to study further and help people out there who want to persue the same course I did .It can also help me grow in the dynamic business world and a solid financial planning and management foundation
15/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Simposo and Muchindu, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
15/12/23, 12:45 pm - +260 97 7825680: Always willing to put in our best
15/12/23, 12:54 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes
15/12/23, 12:55 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes sir
15/12/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/12/23, 1:32 pm - +260 97 7825680: The reason of studying abroad is to diversify my knowledge and broaden my understanding of how things must me done.
Being abroad will also help me see life at a different angle
Further more I think the course I want to study can be best done in India
15/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: This question is for both of you @260977825680 @260974435010
15/12/23, 1:46 pm - +260 97 7825680: It will help me introduce new things that I will see beneficial to the nation. For instance there are some things that are done in India but not done in Zambia which are beneficial and if I learn Abt them I will like to introduce them in my country for it to have maximum quality education
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Please ask your sister to answer the same.
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 7825680: Alright sir
15/12/23, 2:27 pm - +260 97 4435010: The reason I want to study out the country is I think you people have better teaching facilities which are improved than our country.And I can be offered a lot of job opportunities depending if only I choose a better course and have good results at the end of it all
15/12/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 4435010: And the other reason is that our country is a bit backwards in technologies
15/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you two are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/12/23, 3:20 pm - +260 97 4435010: Well I can help in the development of the the education system in our country by becoming a lecturer whose advocate is to introduce new learning skills or if the plan fails ...I can encourage people to work hard so that they apply for the sponsorship and use the technics in our country.... for a better tomorrow..... If I would get another opportunity I would like to organize people who are doing the same course as mine and act as the pressure group towards our country so that the learning skills can be changed by showing them what we archived using new learning skills....
15/12/23, 3:22 pm - +260 97 7825680: What I would like to contribute in the education system of my country is the quality of education offered.
I sadly noticed that a lot of pupils graduate from school without them acquiring any skills at all. What has caused this is lack of practical subjects in the curriculum. In Zambia it's mostly on theory and less of practical so I would rather change that first for the majority of graduates to acquire skills to enable them to survive
15/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Simposo and Muchindu, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/12/23, 3:25 pm - +260 97 4435010: Absolutely true
15/12/23, 3:26 pm - +260 97 7825680: Yes I do agree
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - +260 97 4435010: Yes sir
15/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
15/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

16/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: I understand Mrs.Mwaangwa, but I would love for you also participate actively as parents' participation is equally important.
16/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: So now Simposo and Muchindu, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
16/12/23, 8:53 am - +260 97 5121741: We will try our very best
16/12/23, 8:54 am - +260 97 4435010: I think for me everything has clearly been explained
16/12/23, 8:55 am - Gurvinder: @260975121741 I hope that you are available today for the session.
16/12/23, 8:56 am - +260 97 7825680: Everything is clear sir
16/12/23, 8:56 am - Gurvinder: Please address this?
16/12/23, 8:58 am - +260 97 5121741: I will sir
16/12/23, 8:58 am - +260 97 5121741: Am available
16/12/23, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: @260975121741 So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
16/12/23, 9:04 am - +260 97 5121741: Yes we do but not with india
16/12/23, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
16/12/23, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/12/23, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/12/23, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 9:12 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/12/23, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: @260975121741 are we still connected?
16/12/23, 9:19 am - +260 97 5121741: It's very affordable sir
16/12/23, 9:19 am - Gurvinder: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
16/12/23, 9:20 am - +260 97 5121741: Sorry I was analysing the program
16/12/23, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: Do you think this will be beneficial?
16/12/23, 9:20 am - +260 97 5121741: Very much sir
16/12/23, 9:21 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
16/12/23, 9:21 am - +260 97 5121741: Yes Sir
16/12/23, 9:21 am - +260 97 5121741: Definitely
16/12/23, 9:21 am - Gurvinder: @260975121741 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/12/23, 9:24 am - +260 97 5121741: It's very beneficial sir
16/12/23, 9:24 am - +260 97 5121741: I think we are on the same page
16/12/23, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

16/12/23, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
16/12/23, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

16/12/23, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
16/12/23, 9:26 am - +260 97 4435010: Very much sir
16/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: @260974435010 Today I would like @260975121741 to participate so that I can share that the parents' participation was great and that it can help your application.
16/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: So please let her answer
16/12/23, 9:30 am - +260 97 5121741: Absolutely yes sir
16/12/23, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @260975121741, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/12/23, 9:30 am - +260 97 5121741: Am around sir
16/12/23, 9:31 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/12/23, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
16/12/23, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/12/23, 9:33 am - +260 97 4435010: Exactly sir
16/12/23, 9:33 am - +260 97 7825680: Noted sir
16/12/23, 9:33 am - +260 97 5121741: Yes sir....
16/12/23, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: Alright @260975121741, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting them for their higher education. <This message was edited>
16/12/23, 9:35 am - +260 97 5121741: Yes sir
16/12/23, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
16/12/23, 9:36 am - +260 97 5121741: Yes sir...the only thing we are waiting for are their results
16/12/23, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
16/12/23, 9:37 am - +260 97 5121741: We have elaborated with them clerly
16/12/23, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/12/23, 9:38 am - +260 97 5121741: Yes
16/12/23, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
16/12/23, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: @260975121741 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/12/23, 9:40 am - +260 97 5121741: It would be like a 1500-2250
16/12/23, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: Exactly @260975121741, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750 per child.
16/12/23, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 9:41 am - +260 97 5121741: Yah that's affordable
16/12/23, 9:42 am - +260 97 5121741: Quite good
16/12/23, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/12/23, 9:43 am - +260 97 5121741: Exactly
16/12/23, 9:43 am - +260 97 5121741: Very much okay
16/12/23, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/12/23, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
16/12/23, 9:52 am - +260 97 4435010: Understood sir
16/12/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
16/12/23, 9:54 am - +260 97 4435010: Kind of
16/12/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Alright @260975121741, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
16/12/23, 9:57 am - +260 97 5121741: Alright sir
16/12/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/12/23, 9:57 am - +260 97 5121741: We are ready for the next step and it's clear
16/12/23, 9:57 am - +260 97 5121741: Yes I do
16/12/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/12/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
16/12/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/12/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
16/12/23, 9:58 am - +260 97 4435010: Alright sir
16/12/23, 9:58 am - +260 97 5121741: Noted sir
16/12/23, 10:00 am - +260 97 5121741: I think it's clear as we prepare for the next step
16/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
16/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

18/12/23, 6:45 pm - +260 97 5121741: In April 1994, Rwanda experienced a devastating genocide that lasted for approximately 100 days, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 800,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The country has since been working towards healing and rebuilding. This essay explores the current state of life in Rwanda, 16 years after the genocide, with a focus on the social, economic, and political aspects of life in the country.

Social Life

The social life in Rwanda has seen significant improvements since the genocide. The government has taken steps to promote national unity and reconciliation, including the establishment of the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission. This has led to the return of many refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes, fostering a sense of community and togetherness.

Education has also played a crucial role in the country’s recovery. The Rwandan government has made education a priority, and as a result, the literacy rate has increased dramatically. This has not only helped to bridge the gap between different ethnic groups but has also provided opportunities for the younger generation to pursue their dreams and contribute to the nation’s development.

However, despite these improvements, the legacy of the genocide still impacts social life in Rwanda. Many people continue to grapple with the trauma and loss experienced during the genocide, and the country still faces challenges in addressing issues of inequality and discrimination.

Economic Life

In the aftermath of the genocide, Rwanda’s economy was severely damaged, with the country’s infrastructure and industries in a state of disarray. The government has since implemented various economic reforms and development programs aimed at reviving the economy and improving the living standards of its citizens.

These efforts have resulted in significant economic growth, with Rwanda’s GDP growing at an average of 7-8% per year since 2000. The country has also made strides in poverty reduction, with the poverty rate decreasing from 57% in 2001 to 39% in 2014.

Rwanda has diversified its economy by investing in sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and information technology. This has helped to create jobs and reduce dependency on foreign aid. However, challenges remain, including high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people and women, and the need for continued investment in infrastructure and human capital.

Political Life

In the years following the genocide, Rwanda has made significant strides in terms of political stability and governance. The government has focused on creating a strong and centralized state, with a clear vision for the country’s development.

The Rwandan government has been praised for its efforts to promote gender equality, with women holding 64% of seats in the national parliament, the highest percentage in the world. This has helped to foster a more inclusive political environment and address the underrepresentation of women in political decision-making.

However, concerns have been raised about the lack of political pluralism and the concentration of power in the hands of the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Critics argue that this has led to a lack of checks and balances on the government’s authority and potential human rights abuses.

Conclusion

Life in Rwanda has seen significant improvements since the genocide, with progress made in social, economic, and political spheres. However, challenges remain, including addressing the legacy of the genocide, reducing inequality, and promoting political pluralism. As Rwanda continues to heal and rebuild, it is crucial that the country maintains its focus on sustainable development and inclusive growth to ensure a brighter future for all its citizens.

My name is simposo Mwaangwa who is a young girl with so many dreams from successful role models.Well sometimes we do not have to look far for inspiring stories or models.They are right within us. Nothing bets self motivation.
I have always dreamt of being an accountant ever since I was a toddler because I knew I would one day have the qualities it takes one to be in life.My self esteem was boosted during my secondary level at njase girls school because I was taught some skills in accounts and commerce that really boosted my enthusiasm to study harder and become an accountant.
Well, not going far..my father is an accountant in Zambia national service and he is able to handle all his finances without supervision or help from anyone.He has achieved so many things in life that I believe I would even do do o better if am given an opportunity. Philip chileshe is one of my uncle's who is an accountant under zesco company in choma.Through the experience that he has gained from his work profession,he has opened businesses and he is able to handle them without any quarry.
My other inspiration is Felix mwansa who said that God +hardworking+ people=success.Felix is an accountant who completed with 9 best performing student certificates national wide during various exam sittings as evidenced by attacked certificates.He also encourages us to set principles.
I personally believe that I have everything it takes to attain outstanding academic and professional success.failure will not be an obstacle in my life.
Honourable Situmbeko musokotwane who is the minister of finance in Zambia is also an inspiration to my life.mr Daniels k chisenda who is the permanent secretary, economic management and finance also being a great inspiration who has boosted my self esteem.

16 years after the war in Rwanda there has been a bit of positive change in the country. The main reason arising from this is that the people who were offended still hold a grudge to the inhuman killing that transpired. In an interview the survivers of the war still look back and they still can't let go of it. It seems as if the incident still haunts them of how they lost their loved ones. One man in Rwanda said that he lost a lot of infrastructure, livestock and his relatives. Additionally six of his children were killed including his wife. He still complains that non of the people came to him and apologized for what they had done
Interms of infrastructure that was damaged Rwanda still faces a challenge to rebuild what was lost. There is a complaint that people who have money still can't have good services. One of the services which couldn't be offered to the people was electricity. Even healthy services cannot be easily accessed in Rwanda.
In Rwanda millions of people after the war live on tiny plots with big families. This arises from the fact that people lack the knowledge on family planning. Most homes are overcrowded with relatives who survived the war. This is indeed dangerous as in it can lead to disease outbreak easily within a community
On the positive side people after the war have been counselled and it can be seen that the people have learnt to forgive each other. 
Further more it has been seen that people in Rwanda are trying by all means possible to stop tribal conflict. It is encouraged that intermarriages should be practiced to avoid such occurences.
Furthermore the government, in collaboration with it's citizen, is working tirelessly to bring Rwanda into a middle income nation where each human being can aquire basic needs with no stress at all. 
Life has really been rough for school going children in that they live in fear of being attacked.
It Connor be argued that Rwanda will soon catch up with the rest of the world and aquire necessary peace needed for development

19/12/23, 8:58 am - +260 97 7825680: MY INSPIRATION STORy

While seated on my bed back in 2019 my friends came to visit visit. As soon as they entered my room one of them mentioned Ben Carson. 
I asked what was up with this Ben Carson then everyone got on top of their voices and started shouting on what great things he had done. I then asked one of them to explain about him then he told me to read a book titled Gifted hands.
After reading this book I really got inspired to aim higher in life 
Ben Carson is a Neuro surgeon who had a poor education foundation. But through hard work and determination he became the world's best doctor. 
Ben Carson was a poor young boy  raised by a single mother which meant that life was hard for him. He wasn't good in terms of school but his mother encouraged him and he was able to achieve greater things. 
Yes that's Ben Carson and I want to be great like him. But the most inspiring thing about his story has taught me that no matter how who you are, how bad your grades are or how you perceive yourself, you can  be the best at anything
