21/12/23, 1:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So In Which year will you appear for your A-Level examination?
21/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 284 6336: 2024
21/12/23, 2:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e the picture of results for O-Level and Form-5
21/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Okay sir they are kinda away from where I am I will get someone send me the pics right away

21/12/23, 2:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So why did you not opt for Physics in yoour A-level?
21/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Biology is my favorite subject sir ..I just like everything about the animal cell and anatomy so I guess thats why I chose Biology over physics
21/12/23, 2:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Michael, As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
21/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 284 6336: Not really but I would really love to know the requirements
21/12/23, 3:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
21/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 284 6336: So one cant do medicine without physics 🙂
21/12/23, 4:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
