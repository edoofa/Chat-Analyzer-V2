So did you go through the shared video please?
27/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes I went through it
27/12/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: That's great,

How was your experience?
27/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 765 7687: It was good I got to know more about the Edoofa scholarship program , I got elightened more about how the program works .I found the video very interesting. Seeing my fellow brothers and sisters living their dreams it's motivating.
27/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Talent
27/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Talent, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Nigel!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
27/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 765 7687: I learnt that the Edoofa scholarship program is a program which was made to ensure affordability and employability of tertiary education. The Scholarship program is partially funded ranging from 50%-80% and I learnt that after the scholarship has funded partially my tertiary education fees the remaining amount would be ranging from $2000-$3000 per year . The Scholarship program will  further ease the burden of paying the fees through the EWYL program whereby students participate in online or part-time internship this enables them to earn scholarship credits which then reduce the fees which they are required to pay . 

Nigel further enlightened me about how the scholarship program is unique from other scholarships. My friend articulated the fact which caught my attention about the nurturing which you are given by the scholarship program through counselling and the motivation which they give you in order to work hard . He said the counselors advise on career paths which are in demand so that there is a minimised risk of unemployment after attaining your degree .

Nigel emphasized the need for hardwork in order to attain scholarship credits .He comforted me because I was afraid of being stereotyped he told me that indians are friendly and India is a culturally diverse country. He told me that this scholarship program is nurturing to the point that they even welcome you at the airport once you have arrived in India and then they leave you at your university where you will be learning. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 765 7687: Should I continue?
27/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Talent!

I am glad you had a detailed discussion.
27/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: You can surely add more.
27/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 765 7687: Okay
27/12/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Yes please
27/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 765 7687: I learnt that the Edoofa scholarship program offers academic degrees in India for various courses which have an affiliation from Indian government bodies such as the UGC and are recognized all over the world . This ensures employability.

The Edoofa scholarship ensures three aspects that you become a winner in life which include Knowledge, skills and attitude.
 
To shade more light about these aspects .
1 knowledge which comes from education and my  internationally recognized degree will be proof of that 
2 skill is what I will acquire through learning and working harder .
3 Attitude is a reflection of the person I will become after all these experiences <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Wonderful, Talent.

I am glad you had a thorough discussion with Nigel!
27/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: Did you discuss the details with your parents too?
27/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes I did
27/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 765 7687: Okay Ms Harmehak
27/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Alright please
27/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Talent, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD John Tallach high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
27/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 765 7687: John Tallach high school fees per term Is $600USD.At my school I was in the commercials class and I am always fascinated by accounting and I find it interesting . I have always dreamed of becoming a chartered Accountant. I would like to study accounting for my tertiary education.

My strengths include I am a hardworking student .My school also recognized me for that by awarding me an academic badge . I am committed to learning, I am success driven , I am a good communicator, I am confident and I have the willingness to take on challenges.For my weaknesses I tend to struggle with procrastinating but I tend to overcome it .As a hobby I like socializing, playing soccer or watching it and working out .

My father is a constractor and is also self employed whilst my mother is self employed.The highest level of education which both my parents attained was advanced level through financial hardships but they have a strong passion to see me going beyond their level . They believe in quality education as the key to success and this has resorted in them continually lecturing me about the importance of education.
27/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Talent, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to know of your parents and I am glad they are leading a wonderful family.

27/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Talent do you have any siblings please?

It's a pleasure to know more about them please.
27/12/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: Well Talent now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
27/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 765 7687: I perceive that studying abroad comes with quality education and internationally recognized degrees which promotes a better chance of employability through this I believe studying abroad is a life changing decision.

I think studying abroad does not limit my education only to theoretical and practical knowledge but also it grants an opportunity  for me as a student to evolve and learn more about the world surrounding me through socialisation with my fellow colleagues which come from a different background as mine . This will enable  me to be more culturally intelligent <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: That's very correct and well put across, Talent!

In this case, would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
27/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes I am mentally prepared for a life abroad
27/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 765 7687: Thank you <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Talent, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
27/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 765 7687: Yes some of my family members are aware of my plans to study abroad and they have promised to support my higher education
27/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Yes I agree <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Both mentally and financially
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I am referring to your parents itself, Talent.
27/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Sorry for that
Yes my parents are aware of my plans to study abroad and they are willing to support my higher education mentally and financially
27/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please and I do understand.
27/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
27/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 765 7687: I am confident thank you but I am currently awaiting my a level results
27/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Thank you
27/12/23, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, I am aware of the same
27/12/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Accounting ?
27/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 765 7687: For my O level results I got 7As and 1C , I am yet going to collect my certificate from wanezi high I have not really got time to go and collect it because of the pressures which my A level examination where giving me . For my A level I did commercials as I have already articulated prior to our discussion .The subjects which I had been doing for my A level are Maths , Accounting, Economics and Business Studies.

What motivates me to study accounting is my dream and my desire to become a Chartered accountant and I find accounting very interesting
27/12/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

However do you have the results from the online portal?
27/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 765 7687: Let me try to look for them

That's great and surely well thought off, Talent!

What all did you learn?
27/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 765 7687: I have learnt that it's a demanding course and it's one of the difficult courses in the commercials department. I learnt that for one to be enrolled into that course he should have a strong background in accounting and mathematics. The course takes about 4 years in order for one to acquire a bachelor's degree in Accounting.
27/12/23, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
