20/12/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 888 1216: Hello Ms Harmehak

I am using my mother's phone right now 
Mine is off @263713320964

Anyways l am a young man
English and Shona are languages um comfortable using
I do not have a criminal record
I love learning about  new things...it keep me going ,knowing that they is more to the world than most people see it,and learning how things work
And for this reason that's why l would love to do engineering...it's a field filled will amaizing tech..etc.
Unlike most fields it's not limited
It goes beyond and even beyond our world and deeper into outer space

As for my Education
Right now l just finished writing A level and waiting for my results

But l won't lie 
My A level journey was not an easy one...
I was always behind..I had to work twice as much to keep up with others...
The combination l was doing was Maths 
Physics and Chem

And Maths was my best subject followed with Physics and lastly Chem..
I did find chemistry to be difficult for me because even if l read it, still l would fail to grasp the concepts and when l did grasp them the questions came in another format....
My weakness is l find it hard interacting with people very much...
It's as if l am an extrovert 


I do wish to study Engineering... l love it and they is no better way of making money than with what you love doing..

As for my hobbies l enjoy internet surfing and dancing


I don't come from a wealthy family...we do what we have to,to get by..
We are a family of 5 my me, mother, father and two siblings both girls

My mother is a stay at home mom
And my father works as a lab technician at a local company..

As for my siblings they are both still at school
One in high school the other in primary school
21/12/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Saturday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/12/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 888 1216: We can go ahead we have network prob and electricity problem, so bear with us dear
21/12/23, 10:55 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Hello Mrs Harmehak
@919871782922 

I know my participation is most important for me to be able to get the scholarship especially with the tight competition

Unfortunately due to network issues,l sometimes fail to be online 
Which l know will impact my chances of getting it

Also they is an issue with time especially the early hours of the day..
I happened to be chosen by a company recently due to my performance as far as their work is required and they hired me
So during the day l will be working and around 21:00 C.A.T l knock off
They said after the festive season the times will be better and instead of 21:00 will knock off at 15:00 C.A.T
The reason l am working right now is so l can find money to help me with any educational stuff which might be needed as l go on
So l won't be left out .

I am really sorry but earlier hours of the day are very challenging for me..
If possible
I ask you help me by rescheduling to late hours of the day..
If you're not comfortable it's alright
I will see what l can do
Because l really need this
23/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

26/12/23, 10:09 am - Harmehak: Well Nokutenda now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
26/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 332 0964: Is it oky if l send an audio
26/12/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Yes please
26/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: You see, Nokutenda, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
26/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: It's great to see that you are looking at maximum exposure along with quality education, Nokutenda.
26/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 332 0964: And yes l do believe it's a life changing decision 

And l would want to change my life for the better...
And be able to live a mark on the world 
That l was here and did something worthwhile and something that can change the world's view
26/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 332 0964: They was this other girl who recently also finished University and got a degree 
She came to my work place and asked if l can put in good word for her to become a Till operator but her qualifications make her a lawyer at best...but she told me she can't find that opportunity and said her degree was not working
26/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I completely understand and I am equally glad that you do have a fair judgement of things you realise the opportunity you have currently.
26/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Nokutenda, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
26/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 332 0964: They will certainly do there best
26/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 332 0964: Their *
26/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 332 0964: They actually got me a passport this year for that very reason so..that if l ever get the opportunity
I would have somewhere to start from
26/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: I do understand, Nokutenda.

So can you please elaborate regarding your understanding of the financial aspect of the program and how would you be assisted please?
26/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: That's great
26/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 332 0964: I understand the scholarship can be full or half..

Therefore it now comes to which l might get

If l get full...then that would be lovely
If l get half
I would want to know the prices of the remaining fees so that l can share with my family and see if they can be able to afford for me
26/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 71 332 0964: Or if we can come up with a plan 
Financial or seek financial aid from other sources
26/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a full scholarship?
26/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 71 332 0964: I think it covers the fees 
Then as for living and housing one pays for himself...

Is this correct 🤷🏽‍♂️
26/12/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.

Yes please.
26/12/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
26/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 332 0964: Yes l am confident
Even if l didn't perform my best l know l did well nevertheless....

I really hope l get passes which increase my chances for a scholarship
26/12/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful
26/12/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Engineering ?
26/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 332 0964: I love working with technology...
I find it interesting knowing how something  complicated is made. 
And the thought of me making something on my own which can help and make work easier for someone will make me feel good about myself...
26/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Received please
26/12/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: That wonderful and well thought off, Nokutenda.

So what all did you research regarding your desired field?
26/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 71 332 0964: I have been researching since form 4
I want to do something like software engineering or electrical engineering
26/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: That's great,

So which out of two are you more inclined towards, Nokutenda?
26/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 71 332 0964: Software engineering
26/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 332 0964: But if l was to list 
What l want to do

Since you do have inclination towards Medical sector, may I know why you didn't pursue Biology in your A level?
26/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Well Nokutenda considering Biology is all about Human and living beings and so is medicine!

It's important to study Biology.
26/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
26/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Ohh l see
26/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Let me see if l can do anything and get back to you
26/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please, 

Can you elaborate?
26/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 332 0964: I have no interest in any of these😪
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 332 0964: It's okay l understand
26/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Oky let me send vn
26/12/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Nokutenda, did you ever happen to research about the cost and requirements of Medicine in Zimbabwe too?

15 points in A level being one of them?
26/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Voice note
26/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Yes l did research
26/12/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: So what is your take on the same considering how you expressed earlier, 

I can see you are well aware and medicine wasn't your initial inclination too?
26/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand, Nokutenda.

Considering you initially applied for engineering itself and as per our initial discussion you were inclined towards Engineering too.

Can you please help me understand better the reason behind sudden inclination towards medicine so that I am in a better position to assist?
26/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: I am here to assist you.
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Well if l can do medicine
Then l have no choice but to do engineering
If only l knew l would have also done biology making my A level subjects 4 
But l never knew
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 332 0964: When l was in primary l wanted to be a doctor...
It was my first prefered profession..so l just thought l would go with that
So l researched it's cons
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 332 0964: If l can only do engineering
Can l do electricity engineering instead of software engineering
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Also l know it might not be what you do
But can you tell me Three Engineering programs which guarantee my success and those that are less likely to be replaced by Ai
26/12/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Received and I do understand please.
26/12/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand your challenges.
26/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Considering both your interests are great choices along with Mechanical and Civil Engineering, Nokutenda.
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Mmm nice
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 332 0964: So l will go with electrical and mechanical as my second preference
