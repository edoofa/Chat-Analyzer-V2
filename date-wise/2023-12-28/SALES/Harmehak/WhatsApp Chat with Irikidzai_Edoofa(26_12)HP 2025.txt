I am delighted to know more about everyone!
27/12/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Well Irikidzai, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
27/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 399 0267: I do believe that it is a life changing decision
27/12/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Alright please, in that case would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Irikidzai?
27/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 399 0267: It would really broaden my education in that I would be obtaining an education that is different from our country .

I can see you are looking for maximum exposure.
27/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: Irikidzai, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
27/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 399 0267: Yes my family members are aware of my plans to study abroad. And yes they are more than willing to support me mentally and financially
27/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 399 0267: Yes. I am
27/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I appreciate their support please.
27/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
27/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 399 0267: I appreciate the information. I am confident that I can do better than 2 Advanced Level passes
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: That's great, Irikidzai.
27/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you
27/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Finance ?
27/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 399 0267: I have always had an interest in finance and budgeting money because of my family background in business. And it has great graduate prospects. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: That's great,

What all did you research regarding your desired field, Irikidzai?
27/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 399 0267: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 399 0267: I did do a little research in my desired field
27/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 399 0267: <Media omitted>

27/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Received please
27/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Alright and what all did you learn please?
27/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 399 0267: I learnt that I needed to have a background in finance, Economics, or business studies. I also learnt that there are many career paths in my desired field and that each of these careers paths have different roles and require different levels of experience
27/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 399 0267: A degree in finance or economics can be a great foundation for a career in private equity. Finance degrees typically focus on topics like financial management, investment analysis, and financial markets. Economics degrees typically focus on topics like economic theory, statistics, and econometrics. Both degrees can help you develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which are essential in private equity.
27/12/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: That's great, Irikidzai. Its good to know that you have a thorough awareness of your desired field.

27/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please,

Did you have a thorough reading?
27/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 399 0267: Yes. I did. Thank you

27/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 399 0267: In the next five years, I see myself employed in one of the various departments and also attempting to pursue my studies by taking a post graduate course in chartered accounting or actuarial sciences.
27/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 399 0267: I believe that that if I get into the programme it would really help me to achieve my dreams of furthering my studies and and also help me to find the most suitable career option for me. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: That is really great Irikidzai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
27/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 399 0267: Of course Zimbabwe has an excellent education system but studying abroad offers me an opportunity that I would not get in my own country. It also allows me to travel and understand what happens in other societies. It also opens my education pallete and for international recognition. And it also pushes me to become independent in terms of money and assist my parents by alleviating some of the pressures such as school fees since they have other children <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Very well expressed, Irikidzai, it's great to know that you are open to new challenges and wish to build yourself a promising future.

27/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: That's very correct, Irikidzai!
27/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

27/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 399 0267: No we are not aware
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Alright please
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you for this information. It really helps us
27/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you for highlighting this
27/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
27/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same, Irikidzai?
27/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 399 0267: I think that it very affordable and the earn while you learn programme makes it very easy to pay the fees
27/12/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
27/12/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: Irikidzai, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
27/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 399 0267: I agree the same. It is all very true
27/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 399 0267: Cost of living and travelling in Zimbabwe is a bit expensive
27/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Irikidzai!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
27/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 399 0267: Yes I am. Thank you
27/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
27/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
27/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

27/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please
27/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you for explaining further
27/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
27/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 399 0267: This would be very helpful
27/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 399 0267: No. I have understood everything you have explained so far
27/12/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: That's great
27/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 320 1523: What exactly will these students be doing as they work and earn
27/12/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
27/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 320 1523: OK so this is done at the college
27/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 71 399 0267: That sounds wonderful opportunity
27/12/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Online please,

They would be alloted a dedicated mentor who assists them.

They are start while still in Zimbabwe itself.
27/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 71 399 0267: This is intresting
27/12/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 320 1523: Oh yes I do
27/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Yes
27/12/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
27/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Yes
27/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Irikidzai, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
27/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 399 0267: This message was deleted
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 399 0267: $1500-$2250
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
27/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Okay that's interesting
27/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: You see Irikidzai, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 399 0267: I agree
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
27/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Okay understood
27/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
27/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
27/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
27/12/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
27/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Yes I understand
27/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
27/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Okay
27/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Understood
27/12/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
27/12/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

27/12/23, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Ennie, do connect with Mrs Ruth yourself as well, you can have a direct call too!

@263773201523
27/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you very much
27/12/23, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything, Irikidzai?
27/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 399 0267: So I can only proceed to step 2 after I get the Reservation letter?
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please,

Can you rephrase your question for me?
27/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Okay
27/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 399 0267: So I have to wait for a Reservation letter to proceed to the next phase?
27/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Which reservation letter are you referring to please?
27/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: You mean the acceptance letter?
27/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Yes. Forgive the mistake
27/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
27/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 399 0267: I meant the acceptance letter
27/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: You receive your Acceptance letter at Stage 3, after/if you qualify for the interview at Stage 2 please.
27/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: And your enrollment is done only after you receive the acceptance letter.
27/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Okay. I have understood thank you
27/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Irikidzai.
27/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you
27/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
27/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Irikidzai_Edoofa(26/12)HP" to "Irikidzai_Edoofa(26/12)HP 2025"
27/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 399 0267: Thank you so much
27/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: So now do you have any queries, Irikidzai?
27/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 399 0267: No you have explained quite well. Thank you
27/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
27/12/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
27/12/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
