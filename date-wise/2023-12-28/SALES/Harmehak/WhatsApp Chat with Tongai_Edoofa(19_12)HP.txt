So now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/12/23, 9:28 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

20/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Tongai Jr, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Matthew Rusike College charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
20/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 73 396 6544: I'm 19 years old and I finished my Advanced level final exams this year. Matthew Rusike College charged 498USD per term. I wish to study Computer Science. I was never good in Accounting which makes it my major weakness. I enjoy watching football on my free times . I come from a family of 5. My father is a salesman at Powerlink Trucks and my mother is self employed, she sells school uniforms. I have 2 older sisters Wadzanayi and Vimbai
20/12/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tongai Jr, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know more about your elder siblings please?
20/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Thank you
20/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 73 396 6544: The oldest one is a nurse and the second one is a nurse aid
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please, Tongai Jr.
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Well Tongai Jr now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Yes indeed
20/12/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
20/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Yes I'm willing to adapt quickly and I believe I'm capable
20/12/23, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: Tongai Jr, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
20/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Yes they are
20/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
20/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
20/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Understood
20/12/23, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Computer sciences?

20/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 73 396 6544: And I believe this is an opportunity
20/12/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Received please

20/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Thank you
20/12/23, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: Which out of the two would you like to pursue, Tongai Jr?
20/12/23, 5:07 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Bachelor of Computer Application
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright Tongai Jr, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
20/12/23, 5:13 pm - +263 73 396 6544: In 5 years, I see myself as a person who will be contributing to a better world . I believe that getting into Edoofa's program will pave a way to my dreams. It is a road that can help me  become someone I admire
20/12/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Tongai Jr, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 73 396 6544: I believe studying abroad will give me more employment opportunities than here
20/12/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tongai jr, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
20/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Yes indeed
20/12/23, 5:38 pm - Harmehak: Yes, so I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Tongai Jr.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
20/12/23, 5:47 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Well from here in Zimbabwe, India is envied for it's high levels of education in areas like Medicine and many others. I believe India has the type of knowledge I need
20/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, I can see you have basic awareness!
20/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

20/12/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Tongai Jr.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
20/12/23, 5:56 pm - +263 73 396 6544: No
20/12/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
20/12/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/12/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/12/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

20/12/23, 5:57 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Understood
20/12/23, 5:58 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Please can you add my older sister in the group she wants to be part of the discussion
20/12/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: You can add her
20/12/23, 6:00 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Thank you
20/12/23, 6:00 pm - ~ Shikamaru Nara added +263 77 268 9556
20/12/23, 6:03 pm - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, @263772689556 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/12/23, 6:03 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1600-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/12/23, 6:03 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
20/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 73 396 6544: That can be very helpful
20/12/23, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
20/12/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: Tongai, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
20/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Yes I agree
20/12/23, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tongai?
20/12/23, 6:09 pm - +263 73 396 6544: I can now relate 100 percent
20/12/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
20/12/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/12/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/12/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

20/12/23, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: I sincerely appreciate your kind words, Tongai.
20/12/23, 6:15 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Understood
20/12/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/12/23, 6:17 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Understood
20/12/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Yes I now realize
20/12/23, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: Are you thoroughly following the shared resources as well please?
20/12/23, 6:23 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Yes please
20/12/23, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
20/12/23, 6:25 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Yes
20/12/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: Tongai jr, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
20/12/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/12/23, 6:29 pm - +263 73 396 6544: $1500-$2250
20/12/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/12/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/12/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tongai jr, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/12/23, 6:32 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Yes I think so
20/12/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/12/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
20/12/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/12/23, 6:38 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Understood
20/12/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
20/12/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
20/12/23, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/12/23, 6:40 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Yes
20/12/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/12/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
20/12/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

20/12/23, 6:44 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Wonderful
20/12/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
20/12/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
20/12/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 6:48 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Thank you
20/12/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: Do connect Mrs Ruth with your parents too, Tongai jr!
20/12/23, 6:49 pm - +263 73 396 6544: Okay
20/12/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: As of now do you have any queries, Tongai JR?
20/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 73 396 6544: No
20/12/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
20/12/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
20/12/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “21-12-23” at 9 AM. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

21/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Tongai.
21/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please.
21/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: The current decision would be on the basis of his performance in the Counseling session, along with the test and interview in the later stage.

After the same the Academic Board would be taking a remark on his educational background from the school too!

After the entire process, the result/acceptance letter is shared.
21/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 268 9556: Understood
21/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Anything else that you would like to ask please?

21/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Duly noted.
21/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
21/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 268 9556: I tried sending her a message but failed... I think it wz a network issue
21/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 268 9556: I will keep on trying
21/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Oh alright, I do understand
21/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: You can call her directly as well please.
21/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 268 9556: Noted
21/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
21/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 268 9556: Thank you
21/12/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the video please?
21/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 268 9556: Yes thank you
21/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: How was your experience watching the video please?
21/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 268 9556: It really showed that Edoofa is helping out so many young people in Zimbabwe to get tertiary education... I was amazed by the number of young people i saw
21/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: I appreciate and I am glad it could help you learn better.
21/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Tongai jr, Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

23/12/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
23/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 73 396 6544: Good morning we may continue
23/12/23, 10:09 am - Harmehak: You are yet to complete the questions
23/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 73 396 6544: Okay

23/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 73 396 6544: $350 is the enrollment fee and $200 can be paid within 7 days and $150 within next 30 days
23/12/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Very correct!

So are your parents willing to support you for the same, Tongai?
23/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 73 396 6544: Yes
23/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: I appreciate,

Can you please request them to acknowledge the same using a voice note?
23/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 73 396 6544: Okay
23/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 268 9556: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Duly received please,

I appreciate the support as a family.

Are the parents following the willing to support along with you please?
23/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 268 9556: Yes.. They are
23/12/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
23/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
23/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
23/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
23/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 29th or 30 th December 2023 for $200 and the  29th or 30th of January for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 29th or 30th December 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
23/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 268 9556: Ok i now fully understand.. I do not think we wl be able to meet your deadline, like you mentioned earlier... Yes we are facing serious financial constraints here in Zimbabwe and it is a bit difficult to raise such an amount of money within a few days...i am grateful for the effort you put in helping us understand all about Edoofa but i wouldn't want any disciplinary action to be enforced on my brother because of failure to meet the required deadlines
23/12/23, 11:15 am - Harmehak: Did you follow the discussion earlier as well please?
23/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 268 9556: Therefore i think it is best we leave it here and hopefully in the near future when we have sourced the funds we wl start the process over again
23/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 268 9556: Yes i did bt i did not think the money would be needed this soon
23/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 268 9556: I thought the whole process takes a bit of time
23/12/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Can you please exactly elaborate the concerns for me?

Do you believe taking a decision for Tongai's higher education just like that and concluding would be thoughtful?
23/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Considering that his studies are supposed to start in July next year.

May I know your thoughts on the same?
23/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 268 9556: I am considering my cash inflow nd also thinking that it would be cheaper if he goes to a local university
23/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: @263772689556  , Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Considering the comparison to costs offered here in India along with the Earn While You Learn Program, may I know your understanding of the costs being cheaper in Zimbabwe?
23/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Considering the Zimbabwe economy along with Inflation and fee hikes every year, do you believe it's cheaper please?
23/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 268 9556: It is can be cheaper in the sense that we make payment plans.. Pay fees in installments etc
23/12/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Alright, and may I know the reason behind the conclusion that you cannot do the same if he studies in India?
23/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 268 9556: I haven't done my research yet.. I don't know if you agree to installments.. But the bottom line is.. As for now i cannot raise the money that is required.. Which is why i said we will try again later
23/12/23, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Are you as the sister supporting him financially or the parents are the one doing the same?
23/12/23, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Do you believe after trying again later within 3-4 months you can prepare for his higher education?
23/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 268 9556: I am the one supporting him financially
23/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 268 9556: We will have to see
23/12/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
23/12/23, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Did you connect with Mrs Ruth, @263772689556 ?
23/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 268 9556: Yes i managed to talk to her
23/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware that she is single mother who's profession is farming and currently she is able to have her two daughters study in India?
23/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 268 9556: Yes yu mentioned it
23/12/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Correct,

So may I know what exactly are your concerns other than the current deadline?

I believe you surely have queries however I won't be in a position to assist you if you won't thoroughly discuss are share with me please.
23/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 268 9556: I am not sure if i will be able to raise the stipulated fees even after Edoofa decides to give him a scholarship and pay part of his fees...
23/12/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand and I will help you have a better clarity,

May I know the reason behind this acknowledgement earlier please?
23/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 268 9556: I had not yet calculated how much i would need to save every month
23/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: What else are your queries please?
23/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 268 9556: Those are the main issues.. I am not sure yet.. How my cash inflow will be like this coming year hence it makes it a bit difficult to make a major decision now
23/12/23, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

Do go through our discussion yet again, 

Meanwhile let me discuss the application with Academic Board.
23/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 268 9556: Thank you
