12/09/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Tanatswa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 684 7593: Waiting for this message
12/09/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/09/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

12/09/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
12/09/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/09/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

If your father would be available too. you would be required to join for 1-2 hours only.
13/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 684 7593: Okay
13/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 684 7593: Her name did not came up in the previous conversations
13/09/23, 12:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: It's okay are you in touch with Nicassio and is your father in touch with parents of Nicassio?
13/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 684 7593: I am and my father is in touch with his parents
13/09/23, 12:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So wanted to understand what all did your friend Nicassio tell you about the program when you first applied for the scholarship ?
13/09/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 684 7593: I was told that the program helps candidates secure a future by offering them education based resources inorder to prepare them for a career.

The program also aids candidates with affordable, accessible and easy employment facilities that enhance a candidates learning ability.
13/09/23, 12:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So the cost of education abroad was discussed with you by your Friend at that time ?
13/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 684 7593: No it was not, but Ms. Hamehak did go through the cost of education with me.

She said that in other countries it can range from USD$15 000 to USD$30000  and in India it ranges from USD$3000 to USD$6000 but with Edoofa the cost can further be reduced to around USD$2000 to USD$3000
13/09/23, 1:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Great to know that Ms.Harmehak has explained you everything.
13/09/23, 1:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me ?
13/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 684 7593: Yes
Im in the midst of preparing for my A level final examinations and I'm not quite sure if our sessions would disturb me.
So I was asking how long would each step be and if I happen to find the sessions too long can I get a raincheck or not?
13/09/23, 1:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I completely understand your concern about your A-level final examinations. Our sessions are designed to be flexible and accommodating of your academic commitments. Each step in the process is well-structured, and we aim to make efficient use of your time.

Regarding the duration of each step, they are generally not overly lengthy, and we strive to respect your schedule. If, at any point, you find a particular session to be too time-consuming or if it conflicts with your studies, you can certainly request a raincheck. This won't affect your eligibility or your application status.
13/09/23, 1:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: As you've completed the initial session, you're now left with the interview stage. If you qualify, we will coordinate with you and work out a suitable schedule. Additionally, your parents can assist with the remaining process, which further eases the burden on your academic commitments.

Rest assured, we are here to support you throughout this journey, and we will do our best to ensure that it doesn't disrupt your studies. Your education remains a priority for us, and we will work together to strike the right balance between the application process and your academic responsibilities.
13/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 684 7593: Thank you. Your concern in this matter is greatly appreciated
13/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 684 7593: At this point I have no more questions
13/09/23, 1:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you have any other questions ?
13/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 684 7593: No
13/09/23, 1:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!

Are you clear about the same?
13/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 684 7593: I see it was a memorable event and I can't wait to be a proud Edoofian

20/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 238 6514: Nothing. It's all clear
20/09/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
20/09/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
20/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 238 6514: Yes there are 2 modes of payment and it's all clear. Will  use the most convenient depending on whether I will be paying locally or from abroad
20/09/23, 4:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263772386514 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 11% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
20/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 238 6514: Sure I noted that. Thanks for highlighting
20/09/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges n total in this mode itself would be $388 ($350 + $38 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-
