You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/12/23, 10:46 am - +27 82 285 3820: Sounds great
16/12/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please
16/12/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Mpofu and Mrs Mpofu, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
16/12/23, 10:58 am - +27 82 285 3820: Mr Mpofu is a qualified high school teacher currently teaching in Sout h Africa.l tried my level best to make sure to support my children through thin and dark up to until the girl in concern is waiting for her A level results.
16/12/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mr Mpofu, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

Can you please address on the behalf of Mrs Mpofu?
16/12/23, 11:26 am - +27 82 285 3820: Mrs Mpofu has been a supporting wife who is about to finish her  counseling degree next year.
16/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: That's great, please.

It's a pleasure to know about her.
16/12/23, 11:43 am - Harmehak: So Mr Mpofu, how is Hope as a student,

What are her interests and hobbies, along with her current subject combination please?
16/12/23, 11:50 am - +27 82 285 3820: Hope as a student is an academically gifted  learner who has performed extremely well through out her academically journey and also some extra mural activities including gymnastics and athletics just to mention a few, she is well behaved girl who can work with little or no supervision at all
16/12/23, 11:58 am - Harmehak: That's great, it's a pleasure to know more about her.

Surely seems to be a dedicated student.

Can you please confirm her subject combination?
16/12/23, 12:02 pm - +27 82 285 3820: Mathematics
Physics
Chemistry
Computer Science
16/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
16/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
16/12/23, 12:11 pm - +27 82 285 3820: 100%
16/12/23, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great
16/12/23, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: So what exactly would she like to pursue for her higher education, Mr Mpofu?
16/12/23, 12:29 pm - +27 82 285 3820: We are still yet to finalize but here are our choices so far
Computer programmer
Chemical engineering
Civil engineering
Aerospace engineering
16/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

Since these fields are all different from one another,

May I know which field is she most inclined towards?
16/12/23, 12:40 pm - +27 82 285 3820: Chemical engineering
16/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: What motivates her to opt for Chemical Engineering, Mr Mpofu?

Do you have anyone she looks upto in this field please?
16/12/23, 12:42 pm - +27 82 285 3820: I wish she was here to answer this question
16/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: I can understand, Mr Mpofu.

You can express your thoughts on Chemical Engineering, if you feel it's the right fit for her!
16/12/23, 1:01 pm - +27 82 285 3820: We are a distant family l was opting for either civil engineering or that computer program but she is of chemical engineering so that's why l said l will discuss this with her as soon as l arrive home probably next week.
16/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please!

That's alright, however she can inform me when she would be available today in that case.
16/12/23, 1:04 pm - +27 82 285 3820: I will relay the message as soon as l get in touch with her
16/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Mr Mpofu,

16/12/23, 1:17 pm - +27 82 285 3820: If you may give me a clear picture why India?

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
18/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/12/23, 10:47 am - +27 72 221 2129: Good day...
Unfortunately we are in the village back at home. The signal is not very good 
May I kindly request that we reschedule for some other time if that's fine with you
18/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: While I do understand Mrs Mpofu, you and Mr Mpofu can reply and participate as per the availability of network please.
18/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Have you been able to follow the discussion so far?
18/12/23, 10:52 am - +27 72 221 2129: Yes some of it
18/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.

Did you and Mr Mpofu happen to discuss with Hope regarding the course please?
18/12/23, 10:57 am - +27 72 221 2129: Not yet we should be able to do that in the coming days since I have been here at home while he was still in SA
18/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: That's fine please,

However I am referring to the discussion with Hope?

If you discussed with her?
18/12/23, 11:01 am - +27 72 221 2129: Yes
18/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Wonderful, so which course would you like to pursue please?
18/12/23, 1:06 pm - +27 82 285 3820: Noted
18/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries please?
18/12/23, 1:10 pm - +27 82 285 3820: I will be on my way to Zim late this week, l think l have to sit down and discuss with my family after that we may proceed.
18/12/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
18/12/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Mr Mpofu, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
18/12/23, 1:16 pm - +27 82 285 3820: True
18/12/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: So are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
18/12/23, 1:25 pm - +27 82 285 3820: Yes
18/12/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
18/12/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/12/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/12/23, 3:35 pm - +27 82 285 3820: Clear
18/12/23, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
18/12/23, 7:25 pm - +27 72 221 2129: All noted
Thank you
19/12/23, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
19/12/23, 10:00 am - +27 72 221 2129: Morning morning
19/12/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: I hope you were able to follow the discussion Mrs Mpofu?
19/12/23, 10:03 am - +27 72 221 2129: Yes
19/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: That is great, 

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. After which I would connect you with parents associated with Edoofa too.

Are you ready?
19/12/23, 10:05 am - +27 72 221 2129: We can give it a try
19/12/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: So Mrs Mpofu, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
19/12/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/12/23, 10:07 am - +27 72 221 2129: A lot
19/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/12/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
19/12/23, 10:09 am - +27 72 221 2129: Is this for applying in one university?
19/12/23, 10:09 am - Harmehak: No please.
19/12/23, 10:09 am - Harmehak: Mrs Mpofu, *Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check*.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/12/23, 10:10 am - +27 72 221 2129: Yeah
19/12/23, 10:12 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/12/23, 10:12 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
19/12/23, 10:12 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/12/23, 10:14 am - +27 72 221 2129: Understood
19/12/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful
19/12/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
19/12/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
19/12/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/12/23, 10:19 am - +27 72 221 2129: Sorry I have to take you back a bit. Application is done before the results are out , right ?
19/12/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

On provisional basis which is their previous results,

However fee is refunded if their results donot qualify as explained in Phase 3.
19/12/23, 10:21 am - +27 72 221 2129: Say if Hope qualifies when is the university open ?
19/12/23, 10:21 am - +27 72 221 2129: Got it
19/12/23, 10:22 am - +27 72 221 2129: When is acceptance? <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: She would be coming to India in August 2024.

Initially once she receives an acceptance letter that is when you pay any money.

She begins with her Earn While You Learn Program while she is still in Zimbabwe which will help her earn credits and be familiar with the process and her mentor.
19/12/23, 10:23 am - +27 72 221 2129: Ok
19/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Admissions start at Stage 5 please.

Admissions officer gets in touch as soon as she is a part of the program, where you would receive admission letter from different universities where her application would have qualified for.

After which you sit as a family and decide which university she would like to opt for please.
19/12/23, 10:25 am - +27 72 221 2129: Alright
19/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Anything else that you would like to ask please?
19/12/23, 10:26 am - +27 72 221 2129: At this stage we are on counselling?
19/12/23, 10:28 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

We shall conclude Stage 1 which is counseling session today in about 5-10 minutes.
19/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
19/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

Since he followed the discussion,

Were there any initial doubts and queries?
