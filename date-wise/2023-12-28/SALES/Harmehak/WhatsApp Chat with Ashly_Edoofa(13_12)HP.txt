16/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
16/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Sure Ashly, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 951 8939: Ok ok we are together Ms Harmehak,..... Understood
16/12/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
16/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 951 8939: So is this a fully funded or partly schoolarship?
16/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 951 8939: That's it exactly😊😊
16/12/23, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship?
16/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 951 8939: I think it's a schoolarship whereby school fees, food, residand and some academic staff is provided for free to studends
16/12/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
16/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 951 8939: Ok ok sure l was mistaken here 
Now l understand the difference between the two . This one is question is aschoolarship, it meant to reduce parent's burden on education not providing everything🫣🫣
Am l correct?
16/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 951 8939: Thank you so much
16/12/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
18/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/12/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 951 8939: Afternoon yes we can contiue

19/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 951 8939: I would like to hear from you mostly that one but l believe it can happen
19/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please,

19/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 951 8939: Ok l said l believe it's life changing but can l need to know more in that area

26/12/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
26/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 951 8939: Yes we can
26/12/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
3. Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you?
26/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 78 951 8939: I understood that Edoofa program is a schoolarship not a sponsorship. It help studends by reducing students tuition fees. Some of the things will be under your parents hands. It is a 50- 100% schoolarship that depend on your peformance and on average it is $6000 to $8000 per year for a student to survive abroad

Yes my family is willing to support me l had elaborated further and they said they have some sources of finance
26/12/23, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Duly received Ashly.

So did you understand the following as well?
26/12/23, 11:43 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 951 8939: Ok ok yeah did understand that also
26/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So what all did you discuss with your parents after going through the document, Ashly?
26/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 951 8939: I explained how the schoolarship will be helping us and how it reduces the cost. I also mentioned about the Earn While you learn program, which they understood very well. They said they are going to try all means to support me
26/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Can they acknowledge the same using a voice note, Ashly?
26/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 951 8939: Ok no problem now l am not see home but around 3 l will let him send the audio
26/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Surely, Ashly.
26/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Ashly, considering you earlier shared financial challenges,

What is their financial planning to support your higher education in India?
26/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 951 8939: They said said l will sell cattle and thus the only l know
26/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Ashly,

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I have been expecting proper participation, for your application for Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
