11/09/23, 8:50 am - +263 71 510 9923: Is this scholarship for free
11/09/23, 8:58 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
11/09/23, 8:58 am - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
11/09/23, 8:58 am - Harmehak: You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 3000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
11/09/23, 8:58 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

12/09/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: I would also share a document for you to go through.
12/09/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 9:10 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
13/09/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 510 9923: Yes we can start
13/09/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: So did you have a thorough reading through the document, Jonathan?
13/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 510 9923: I will read it after school
13/09/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: You can inform me once you have read it in that case.
13/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 510 9923: Ok
13/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 510 9923: Ok i have understand, so when is the deadline of paying the fees
13/09/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 510 9923: And the deadline of intake
13/09/23, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: Since you are an Upper 6 student please, your intake would be August 2024.
13/09/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 510 9923: Ok,thank you for your help
13/09/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Jonathan did you discuss the expenses and the document with your parents please?
13/09/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 510 9923: Yes , i have discussed with them but they don't have enough money to pay . I had my relatives which can i begg money if my results are out
13/09/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 510 9923: They will try by all means to help me on this scholarship until the end
13/09/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Now you see Jonathan, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
13/09/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: You can surely discuss everything and get back to me please.
13/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 71 510 9923: OK thank you thus good hint you give me
13/09/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please.
14/09/23, 5:42 am - +263 71 358 1387: Jonathan is my child . I will begg money to my relatives in order to pay the fee
14/09/23, 5:52 am - +263 71 510 9923: They is my friend want to join studying in india
14/09/23, 9:07 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!
