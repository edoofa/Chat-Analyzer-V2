*B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering*
18/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 138 3477: Thank you sir
18/12/23, 6:28 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
18/12/23, 6:28 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

18/12/23, 6:34 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
18/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 71 138 3477: Yes sir with pleasure
18/12/23, 6:36 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.
18/12/23, 6:37 pm - Gurvinder: Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.
18/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 138 3477: That's great sir

27/12/23, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: So now Cleophas, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
27/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 138 3477: No sir I don't have much to ask
27/12/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: With interactions with your friend Asher who is studying here in India did you manage to discuss and compare the cost of education in your country and with EDOOFA Scholarship in India? If yes can you tell me the range of Annual Costs you foresee with the prestigious EDOOFA SCHOLARSHIP that your parents/guardians will have to bear?
27/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 138 3477: Here in my country the annual fess is about $2400 here in my country in our of the best universities which is very expensive comparing to one of the Universities in India
27/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: Please, I am talking about India.
27/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: Have you chatted with your friend Asher, who studies in India, about comparing education costs in your country to the EDOOFA Scholarship in India? If you did, what's the estimated yearly expense range with the EDOOFA SCHOLARSHIP that your parents might need to cover?
27/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 138 3477: Asher taught me that annually the education costs in India is about $600 and my parents would cover me half the cost and the scholarship might cover me half the cost
27/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
27/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
27/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 138 3477: Thank you sir for briefing
27/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Cleophas, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
Did your friend Asher tell you about the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM and the earnings to support and pay their University Costs?
27/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 138 3477: No she didn't
27/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Cleophas, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
