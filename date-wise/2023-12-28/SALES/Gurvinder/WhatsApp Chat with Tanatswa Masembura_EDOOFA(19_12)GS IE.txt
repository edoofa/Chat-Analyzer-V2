21/12/23, 8:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
21/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 402 0424: Morning
21/12/23, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: So is Tanatswa available for the session?

21/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Caroline, also do tell me whether you learnt about Caroline’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
21/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 402 0424: I didn't co-op up with the program
21/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Due to network problem
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/12/23, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
21/12/23, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
21/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes it is
21/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Ruzvidzo, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
21/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes
21/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Ruzvidzo, I would like to know Tanatswa better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about him, his career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. His highest education level?
2. The course He would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is his parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting him for his Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting him financially for his higher education abroad?
7. Does he have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school does he study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

*B. Plan or Bachelor of Planning*
27/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you so much now how are we going to proceed
27/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
27/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes l am
27/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
27/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes
27/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: *B. Plan or Bachelor of Planning* is four years long full-time professional degree course in planning for aspirants who wish to become planning professionals.
27/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: *Why Study B Planning ?*

This course is the first step for a student who wishes to pursue a career in urban planning and development. This course of study is in high demand. In recent times, where the whole world is shifting towards strategies and planning of a sustainable environment while the cities are suffering from poorly executed planning, demands in intervention in planning smart cities, solar empowered settlements, constructions with the eco-friendly and green effect is increasing by each passing day.
