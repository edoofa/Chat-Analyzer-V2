Here's what i learnt from the Edoofa awareness initiative

In order to identify fraudulent programs that impersonate scholarships in India  :

°An organisation must have a registar of company document that is stamped and certified by the government of india.
° It should also have a permanent account number as Every organisation in india must be registered with the Income tax Department of India. 
°An organization must also have been active for 5 years or more in order for it to be credible.
°Some agencies may also imitate official documents from the government therefore you must be able to differentiate between an imitated copy and the original document. Mostly, all companies in India have a unique letter head and watermarks for their documents and they also include a complete address office. 
°It is also advised to request the national id for local bank accounts so you can confirm if the details match. 
° The organisation must have futuristic goals for your career and they must use mentorship and guidance counselling as one of their tools in ensuring your future.
21/12/23, 7:18 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

27/12/23, 7:53 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
