26/12/23, 8:12 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Mazvita, Mr and Mrs Shava!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
26/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 310 3998: Good morning 
Yes you have
26/12/23, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mazvita,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
26/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 310 3998: Thank you very much for the update,I’ll be awaiting for the assessment of the application.Meanwhile may you kindly highlight on the scholarship and the requirements on my part.
26/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 310 3998: Most appreciated
26/12/23, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, but first Mazvita, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Abdul, is that correct?
26/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
26/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Yess correct
26/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Yes we are
26/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Abdul, also do tell me whether you learnt about Abdul’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
26/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 310 3998: I got to know about Edoofa Program from Mavis Chigweremba and Abdul
26/12/23, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share your learnings from them.
26/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 310 3998: My understandings of the program are that it requires a minimum of 2 advanced level passes and presents an opportunity to various African countries to go and pursue their education in India. It helps with issues related to affordability of higher education and makes applicants ready for the work environment.
26/12/23, 9:31 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
26/12/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Thank you sir
God Bless You Too
27/12/23, 8:28 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
27/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 310 3998: Morning everyone
27/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
27/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
27/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
27/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
27/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 310 3998: Yesss
27/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mazvita, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 310 3998: Yes i can meet these metrics
27/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 310 3998: Dad👑❤️.vcf (file attached)
27/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 310 3998: Please add my father’s number
27/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 310 3998: For both parents’ participation
27/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: I have shared the invitation link with him, please ask him to join the group.
27/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 310 3998: Okay thank you <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder added +263 71 878 9938
27/12/23, 8:06 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
27/12/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Noted

27/12/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 310 3998: I’m sorry for the inconveniences we had some network challenges today
