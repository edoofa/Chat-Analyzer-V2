27/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 794 9160: My name is Ruth Nicole Shumba , a form 5 Art student at Zvishavane high . Being awarded the chance to study in my field at the institution is an incredible opportunity for me and one l intend to seize wholeheartedly without reservation. I have consistently proven throughout my previous studies that when presented with an opportunity l will strive as hard as l can to best represent myself and reward those who have granted me a change to prove such. This is evident in my primary and O level results which are quite pleasing. Despite financial hardships, l have always done what is necessary to further my studies. Being a child of a deceased father and having only my mother, who also has to look after my sisters for financial support is quite hard especially considering that l am pursuing my A level. I will be doing my utmost to not let this affect my participation and concentration required to gain as much as l can from the program.My favourite hobby is surfacing on the Internet

27/12/23, 2:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Great, So now I would like you to share the picture with me your previous qualification results i.e O and A-Level results along with the subject combination in A-level?
