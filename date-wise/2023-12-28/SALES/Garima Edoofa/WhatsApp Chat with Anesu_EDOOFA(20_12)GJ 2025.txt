20/12/23, 2:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 254 0133: This course in my country is underrated to begin with, to get recognition and being able to grow would be difficult, but being abroad means more exposure l get to meet international companies and l also get to interact with international students meaning l get to learn a lot.
Another reason is if l get into the Edoofa program it's going to be cheaper for my parents because there's support in payment unlike here it's going to be expensive because they have to pay the full fees <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 2:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Duly noted Anesu.
20/12/23, 2:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
20/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 254 0133: I want to be able to change the fixed mindset that's in the education system that art subjects do not really deserve recognition, l will be holding seminars whereby l show students who want to persue careers in ARTs that it's possible and there are a wide range of courses they can select from and they can do it 
I also want to change the idea that Art subjects are the last option they should be the first option just like sciences and should not be looked down upon.
I also want to show students that they should not be shy to fulfill their dreams because out there other students are doing it too
I would also use the skills which l would have attained to pass this message all over schools in Zimbabwe. So l will be using newspapers , news channels and books so that every student in my country get to hear the message l would be passing
20/12/23, 3:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, me that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
20/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 254 0133: I will contribute learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in Zimbabwe by establishing partnerships with colleges and schools . I will offer my knowledge through workshops , seminars and even training sessions with the teachers so that they also can share it with their students.

20/12/23, 4:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Anesu, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
20/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 254 0133: I do agree
20/12/23, 4:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
20/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Yes l am curious about that
20/12/23, 4:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

21/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 254 0133: I am not , but l do not know about my parents
21/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 254 0133: Please may you inform me on the expense
21/12/23, 10:58 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you elaborate more on that please.
21/12/23, 10:59 am - Garima Edoofa: yes please.
21/12/23, 10:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
21/12/23, 10:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/12/23, 10:59 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 10:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 71 254 0133: I mean that l am not sure on the prices, but maybe my parents did some research l am not aware of
21/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 254 0133: Thank you for the information let me go through it
21/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 254 0133: Ok thank you for the information
May you please tell me more about the earn while learn program
21/12/23, 11:07 am - Garima Edoofa: yes please
21/12/23, 11:07 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/12/23, 11:07 am - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 254 0133: Ok l understand thank you
21/12/23, 11:12 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

21/12/23, 11:13 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 11:13 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
21/12/23, 11:13 am - Garima Edoofa: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
21/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 254 0133: I think it will be benefiting since l get an opportunity to learn how to tuckle hard situations in the future and also getting an opportunity to interact with the experts
21/12/23, 11:26 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/12/23, 11:26 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/12/23, 11:39 am - Garima Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, it is my lunch break and we'll be connecting shortly after ONE HOUR.
21/12/23, 11:55 am - +263 71 254 0133: That is fine
21/12/23, 12:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 254 0133: It is what l have been looking for and the opportunity to be financially independent is just amazing
21/12/23, 12:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Every student in The Edoofa Scholarship Program gets this opportunity.
21/12/23, 12:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.     Earn While You Learn: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
21/12/23, 12:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
21/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 71 254 0133: The first and the fourth
21/12/23, 12:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Anesu, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
21/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Yes there are the ones who would be supporting me
21/12/23, 12:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know.
21/12/23, 12:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Anesu, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
21/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 391 6654: Afternoon Garima how are you ?  I am Mrs Matsekwa ,Anesu's mother.We are supporting 100% in achieving her dreams.
21/12/23, 1:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Greetings Mrs. Matsekwa. I appreciate your support both mentally and financially for your daughter's higher education abroad.
21/12/23, 1:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: *I would like you to acknowledge the same in the form of a voice note please*
21/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 391 6654: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 1:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Mrs. matsekwa and Anesu, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now that we have covered everything from the counseling session, let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that, you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
21/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Yes we are ready
21/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 391 6654: Yes I am ready
21/12/23, 1:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright.
21/12/23, 1:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: So per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 254 0133: From $1500 to $2250
21/12/23, 1:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/12/23, 1:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 1:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: We know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the word which is why we have decided for this slowdown period that a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.

Which simply means, if you are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receives Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, you will be receiving a time span of 7 days to pay the enrollment of payable amount of $350
21/12/23, 1:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
21/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 391 6654: The fees are reasonable.
21/12/23, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes indeed it is.
21/12/23, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
21/12/23, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 391 6654: This is great as this gives one the opportunity to have enough time to gather finances.
21/12/23, 1:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes indeed.
21/12/23, 1:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs. Annah, as we have discussed the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, can you share with me what you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
21/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 391 6654: From what I understood the Edoof program gives a student the opportunity to earn as they learn.This means  that they go to school and they put into practice what they will have learnt .This gives them the opportunity to earn some money that will be used to pay off their fees.The payment is based on the scores ,the higher the score rate the greater the earnings.This means if one can work for as much $150 per month ,that means 1800 earned.This means one is able to pay for more than their fees on their own.
21/12/23, 1:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
21/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Ok thank you for the information
21/12/23, 2:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Anesu and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
21/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Yes l have understood
21/12/23, 2:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, let me brief you on how the process follows after you are found eligible and enrolled in the Program which is Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
21/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 254 0133: No l am not familiar with it
21/12/23, 2:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 2:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
21/12/23, 2:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
21/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Yes please do
21/12/23, 2:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
21/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Yes l am clear of the process
21/12/23, 2:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Ok
21/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 254 0133: So how long do Visa's last
21/12/23, 2:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: It lasts for the entire course duration.
21/12/23, 2:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
21/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Ok that is great news
21/12/23, 2:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes please.
21/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 254 0133: No for now l don't have any questions
21/12/23, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Anesu.
21/12/23, 2:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/12/23, 2:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries that generally parents have.
21/12/23, 2:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 2:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *Tomorrow at 9:00 AM CAT* I would be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
21/12/23, 2:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

21/12/23, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!

22/12/23, 11:14 am - Garima Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
22/12/23, 11:17 am - Garima Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 254 0133: 1.Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications
2.India 
3.$6000-8000
4.$2000-3000
5.$350
6.7 days
7.l am clear about the same
22/12/23, 11:28 am - Garima Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
22/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 71 254 0133: Yes they are
22/12/23, 12:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/12/23, 12:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/12/23, 12:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
22/12/23, 12:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 12:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 28th   or 29th December 2023 for $200 and the 28th   or 29th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 28th or 29th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
22/12/23, 12:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: *I would like your parents to acknowledge this message and give their confirmation in the form of a voice note*
22/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 254 0133: I've told them to open the messages they will reply in a bit
22/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 391 6654: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 1:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: Feel free to initiate a discussion and inform me of any questions or concerns you may have. I'm more than willing to assist you. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could review the videos I sent today. For any inquiries, I have provided the contact numbers of the parents who are beneficiaries of the program from Zimbabwe, and if you require additional contacts, please let me know."
22/12/23, 2:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263712540133 @263773916654 are we connected?
22/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 254 0133: I talked to my parents and they feel like we should discuss again and then they can make a final decision from there
22/12/23, 2:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Understood, Anesu. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I'll be more than happy to assist and address your queries before we proceed with the interview.
22/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 254 0133: Thank l will get back to you

As discussed yesterday I am here to continue with our session.

Shall we start?
23/12/23, 7:58 am - +263 71 254 0133: Good morning Ms Garima we have a power cut this side .
But l talked to my parents and with schools opening up soon and exams coming up the money for enrollment may not be available
23/12/23, 8:10 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what all you happen to discuss with your parents?
23/12/23, 8:15 am - +255 753 273 020: Good morning @918810545912. Hope all is well. My apology i have not been able to participate in the group conversation due to work commitments. I'm here to guarantee the support of my daughter Anesu to pursue her educational dreams through the EDOOFA scholarship. I also understand the facts raised before on enrolment fees and earn while you learn programme.

I am ready to support Anesu all the way for her educational requirements. 

Considering the Zimbabwean economic environment the Edoofa scholarship comes in handy as it relieves us the parents on the burdennof paying huge sums of money which we might not afford for our child to gain the top notch International education.
23/12/23, 8:21 am - +255 753 273 020: Timing in this regard becomes very important. We are able to pay the USD350 enrolment fees. When does it fall due? Now or the year 2025. We are left with like 18 days for schools to open in Zimbabwe. We have to fockout her fees this January. But any other time we will be able to pay
23/12/23, 8:25 am - Garima Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Anesu since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Anesu's fee formalities, it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same, please?
23/12/23, 2:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your reply, but I guess you were occupied, I will connect with you on *Tuesday again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue our conversation with a fresh mind.
As we approach the festive season, I want to take a moment to wish you and your loved ones a very Merry Christmas. May this special time bring joy, peace, and prosperity to you all. I hope the holiday season fills your home with warmth and your heart with happiness.

Best wishes for a wonderful Christmas and a New Year brimming with blessings and success. ⭐
