20/12/23, 10:01 am - Kunal: Noted, Nora
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/12/23, 10:01 am - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/12/23, 10:01 am - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
20/12/23, 10:01 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/12/23, 10:01 am - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
20/12/23, 10:02 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 10:02 am - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
20/12/23, 10:02 am - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
20/12/23, 10:11 am - +265 986 31 12 17: Yes, the earn while you learn program not only seems to help students financially but it also appears to give students the opportunity to learn and gain knowledge on digital aspects
20/12/23, 10:12 am - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
20/12/23, 10:13 am - +265 986 31 12 17: Very well understood Sir
20/12/23, 10:13 am - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
20/12/23, 10:13 am - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
20/12/23, 10:14 am - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
20/12/23, 10:14 am - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
20/12/23, 10:16 am - +265 986 31 12 17: The forth, because it seems to be the final and most important point that now brings students to the destination where they are to fulfil their dreams
20/12/23, 10:17 am - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

20/12/23, 10:17 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
20/12/23, 10:19 am - +265 986 31 12 17: My parents will be assisting me
20/12/23, 10:19 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
20/12/23, 10:21 am - +265 986 31 12 17: My family feels delighted and they see it as a great  opportunity for me to venture into medical studies and achieve my goals.
20/12/23, 10:21 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
20/12/23, 10:22 am - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
20/12/23, 10:24 am - +265 986 31 12 17: I agree that the three stated aspects might be the most important
20/12/23, 10:24 am - Kunal: Indeed Nora
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
20/12/23, 10:24 am - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
20/12/23, 10:24 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 10:26 am - +265 986 31 12 17: Sir , if it be okay with you, I would like to request for a rescheduling of the continued counselling
20/12/23, 10:27 am - Kunal: May I know what happened, Nora?
20/12/23, 10:28 am - +265 986 31 12 17: We have an electrical power problem
20/12/23, 10:28 am - Kunal: I understand
We are left with 10 minutes of session, do you think we can complete it now?
20/12/23, 10:34 am - +265 888 30 10 67: Morning sir , we have a black out  and I  believe her phone  is now off , am not at home she would have used my phone .
20/12/23, 10:37 am - Kunal: I understand
May I know if you can take part in the session?
20/12/23, 10:38 am - +265 888 30 10 67: Yes I will
20/12/23, 10:39 am - +265 888 30 10 67: Those some questions need to answered only be her .
20/12/23, 10:40 am - Kunal: That is fine
We are left with the last part where you can also take equal participation
20/12/23, 10:40 am - Kunal: Have you gone through this?
20/12/23, 10:41 am - +265 888 30 10 67: Let me go through it
20/12/23, 10:42 am - +265 888 30 10 67: Yes
20/12/23, 10:42 am - +265 888 30 10 67: I now have gone through it
20/12/23, 10:53 am - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
20/12/23, 10:53 am - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/12/23, 11:01 am - +265 888 30 10 67: Following
20/12/23, 11:04 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 11:08 am - +265 888 30 10 67: I believe we have touched almost everything.
20/12/23, 11:10 am - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
20/12/23, 11:25 am - +265 888 30 10 67: Yes please  explain
20/12/23, 11:29 am - +265 986 31 12 17: We have so far almost gone past the 4th stage
20/12/23, 11:30 am - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
20/12/23, 11:30 am - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
20/12/23, 11:30 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
20/12/23, 11:33 am - +265 986 31 12 17: May you further explain on the part that concerns the admission officers and the partner universities
20/12/23, 11:36 am - Kunal: Once you are enrolled in the program, you will be connecting with our admission officers who will be guiding you further with the admission process of universities

20/12/23, 11:52 am - +265 986 31 12 17: Very well understood sir
20/12/23, 12:01 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.

23/12/23, 12:11 pm - +265 986 31 12 17: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 12:17 pm - Austin: Thank you for sending, The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600
23/12/23, 12:22 pm - +265 986 31 12 17: Does this means it is to be paid off before the departure to India?!
23/12/23, 12:34 pm - Austin: That is right and then you receive the Admissions Acceptance Letter which  is the most important document for the visa processing. Our Admissions team will be guiding you through the process and will provide you payment plans to reduce the financial pressure
23/12/23, 12:49 pm - +265 986 31 12 17: Very well understood
23/12/23, 12:50 pm - +265 986 31 12 17: May you please explain more on the admission offers?
23/12/23, 1:01 pm - Austin: Great!
23/12/23, 1:03 pm - Austin: Sur, after your enrollment you will be guided through the Earn While you Learn Program and Admissions process. Our Admissions Team will be drafting your statement of purpose and you will receive University Offer letter after the sessions.
23/12/23, 1:08 pm - +265 986 31 12 17: Alright, thank you
