Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
18/12/23, 1:53 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: So i am a 43year old Malawian with 2 children the first being a girl aged 16 and a boy aged 14.

I am a qualified Administrator worked in International Retail as an Administration Manager specifically Shoprite Trading Company for 6 years. Then joined an HIV Management Malawian Trust funded by the USA Government called Lighthouse Trustas a Capacity Building Operations Manager for 10 years. I moved on to another Malawian NGO called Partners in Hope also funded by USA Government as a Care and Treatment Project Manager for 2 years. While with Partners in Hope, I established my own Car Care Business which was a diversification from car importing business. I have founded the busines and in its 6th year now.

I hold a Batchelor of Business Administration with 2nd Class Credit. I took leave of absence from Nottingham Trent University where i was doing MBA in Data Analytics due to finances.

I believe in Education and I believe my Children are uniquely endowed with skill, passion and determination to achieve anything they pit their mind to. I am aware that what they want to become is not fully available in Malawi so an opportunity to study what they want to really become elsewhere is really an exciting prospect for us <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 1:53 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: If you need more information please do let me know
18/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Zimba, It's truly inspiring to hear about your diverse career journey and your commitment to education for both yourself and your children. Exploring opportunities for your children to study abroad and pursue their passions is indeed an exciting prospect.
18/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Mr. Zimba
18/12/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Proceeding further, To Guide Smantha become a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with her introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me a bit about herself: her strengths, her weaknesses, her hobbies, and a detailed description of her family background. Also do share the following details:

1. Her current educational level MSCE and subject combination
2. The course she would like to study and why
3. What do her parents do (their profession)
4. What is his parent’s highest education level?
5. Does she have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
6. Who has been financially supporting her for your Education so far
7. Who will be financially supporting her higher education abroad
18/12/23, 2:14 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: Samantha is like I said 16, quite an interesting child, strong willed, compassionate, very artistic. She has grown up with an arts inclination, she used to do Ballet, then drawing, clothing design, then went on to do music, really passionate about playing an electric guitar, she loves to perform for an audience at school. She is big on poetry at the moment mostly focusing on mental health. I am happy to share one of her latest poetry pieces.

She is yet to sit for MSCE in August of 2024, her strength is in Humanities. History, Biology, Social and Life Skills, English, Chemistry, Agriculture are her strength.

Samantha would love to do Psychology and become a therapist. 

Samantha's mother is a HR Manager in a construction company and in her final uear of BSc Business Administration. As mentioned already Samantha's fathers is an administrator currently a business owner. 

Samantha has one sibling who is in Form 3.

Samantha's financial support has been her mom and dad and they intend to support her higher education abroad ofcourse with a plan to seek for scholarships
18/12/23, 2:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Zimba, Thank you for sharing about Samantha, Moving forward, I kindly request that you share Samantha's MSCE results with me, preferably in picture format for a more comprehensive overview.
18/12/23, 2:17 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: As mentioned she is yet to sit for MSCE in actually July of 2024. She is going into 2nd term of form 4 in January
18/12/23, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Zimba, That is well noted!
18/12/23, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now, we accept up to 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35, this would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program



The minimum requirement was higher pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident for Samantha about meeting the requirements and performing well in MSCE!
18/12/23, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: We anticipate better and lower than 35 for sure
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: Not yet, this has been our first consideration
18/12/23, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

*Bachelor in Psychology*



Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
19/12/23, 9:02 am - +265 888 47 64 20: That will be great yes
19/12/23, 9:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Bachelor in Psychology* is a 3-year undergraduate course.

*What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*

In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.

 *What is it about?*

Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.

BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.

*Career Prospects*

What can you do with a BA degree in Psychology?

The graduates of BA Psychology have a lot of opportunities ahead, both in academics and in the job sector.

*Jobs*

The graduates of this course get various opportunities to work in many different fields in both the private sector and the government sector. They get work in departments like hospitals, educational institutes, corporate organizations, etc. Some of the profiles which are open for them are Social Worker, Sales Representative, Recruiters, Teachers, etc.
19/12/23, 9:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope this course aligns with what you are aiming for*
19/12/23, 9:09 am - +265 888 47 64 20: It does look like her inclination
19/12/23, 9:09 am - +265 888 47 64 20: She will be home from school today, she should be able to view this and also comment
19/12/23, 9:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Zimba
19/12/23, 9:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
19/12/23, 9:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Mr. Zimba,  now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
19/12/23, 9:26 am - +265 888 47 64 20: I have not checked recently but have an idea when i was doing mine a few years back
19/12/23, 9:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/12/23, 9:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 9:34 am - +265 888 47 64 20: Yes it is
19/12/23, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
19/12/23, 9:42 am - +265 888 47 64 20: Please share
19/12/23, 9:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
19/12/23, 9:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/12/23, 9:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
19/12/23, 9:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
19/12/23, 9:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
19/12/23, 9:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
19/12/23, 9:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 9:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
19/12/23, 9:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think your child will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
19/12/23, 9:51 am - +265 888 47 64 20: Yes indeed i have no doubt. We already had plans that while waiting to go into higher education, she will spend sometime at my office just to get to understand how the work world works, so with the EWYL program, that element is very well covered
19/12/23, 9:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
19/12/23, 9:53 am - +265 888 47 64 20: This is great
19/12/23, 9:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed!
19/12/23, 9:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
19/12/23, 9:56 am - +265 888 47 64 20: Number 4 is quite comforting and the best for me
19/12/23, 9:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

19/12/23, 9:59 am - +265 888 47 64 20: Awesome
19/12/23, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Zimba,  I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feels about you studying abroad?
19/12/23, 10:12 am - +265 888 47 64 20: Like i said, not too many options in Malawi for what they want to do so abroad has always been an option on the table, so this far we are excited about this conversation
19/12/23, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Zimba, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make her career advance at an even greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help her in uplifting her family there by herself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to her parents.
19/12/23, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
19/12/23, 10:18 am - +265 888 47 64 20: Indeed
19/12/23, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
19/12/23, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
19/12/23, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
19/12/23, 10:32 am - +265 888 47 64 20: Please go ahead
19/12/23, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*

19/12/23, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/12/23, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
19/12/23, 10:44 am - +265 888 47 64 20: Driving now, will respond
19/12/23, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Zimba, I will be waiting!
19/12/23, 11:21 am - +265 888 47 64 20: This is understood
19/12/23, 11:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Mr. Zimba
19/12/23, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 11:23 am - +265 888 47 64 20: I understand we have done stage 1
19/12/23, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
19/12/23, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
19/12/23, 11:29 am - +265 888 47 64 20: Oh okay! Sure proceed
19/12/23, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
19/12/23, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.

We were wondering if it werw possible as you mentioned that if we miss now another opportunity comes after 4 months, we would like to take that option. 

School fees for 2 guys and everything they need and on top of it the 350usd is just not doable now. 

We wait to hear from you on the way forward
