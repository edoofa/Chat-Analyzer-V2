Before delving into your Christmas celebrations, I'd like to bring your attention to the session timings. 
Considering your hectic schedule, I've made some adjustments to our timetable.

*From now onwards, our sessions will take place from Monday to Friday, spanning from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*. Yes, we've extended the session to 2 hours for a more productive interaction. 

So are you excited about the session? <This message was edited>

26/12/23, 3:21 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So before we start, I couldn't stop myself but ask, how was your Christmas? 🌲
26/12/23, 3:24 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. 

*Now we will meet tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*
I want you to inculcate the habit of joining the session on your own and just give a quick "I'm here" when you're online at 1:30 pm. 
Can I expect this from you?
26/12/23, 3:27 PM - +263 78 046 5800: It was good
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
Have a wonderful day ahead!
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - +263 78 046 5800: Thank you
