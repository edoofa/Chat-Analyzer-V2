26/12/23, 12:29 PM - +263 78 911 4587: Thank you for the concern. Well my family had a wonderful day but I personally don't believe in christmas
26/12/23, 12:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Why so?
26/12/23, 12:37 PM - +263 78 911 4587: According to my understanding of the Bible Jesus wasn't born on Christmas
26/12/23, 12:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Absolutely, and it's a great point to clarify. The Bible doesn't provide a specific date for the birth of Jesus. December 25th was chosen by later Christians to celebrate His birth, but it's not mentioned in the biblical accounts. The choice of December 25th was influenced by the Roman festival of Saturnalia and the winter solstice. Some scholars believe that Jesus was more likely born in the spring or fall.

So, when people celebrate Christmas on December 25th, it's more about commemorating the birth of Jesus and spreading the message of love, peace, and goodwill rather than pinpointing the exact historical date. Different cultures and Christian denominations may have varying traditions and interpretations related to the celebration.
26/12/23, 12:59 PM - +263 78 911 4587: I do understand that but the Bible clarify on the time angel Gabriel visited Mary with the message of her carrying the baby
