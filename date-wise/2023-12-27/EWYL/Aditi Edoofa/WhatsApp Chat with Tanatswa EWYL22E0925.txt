I hope this message finds you well. I trust you had a wonderful Christmas holiday!🎅🏻

I wanted to reach out and let you know that as you know that your session on Monday was missed due to the festivities🎄
To ensure we don't miss out on our sessions and updates, let's *schedule a session tomorrow from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM.*
Make sure that *follow the PROUD EDOOFIAN ritual* and are on time for the session🕰️
