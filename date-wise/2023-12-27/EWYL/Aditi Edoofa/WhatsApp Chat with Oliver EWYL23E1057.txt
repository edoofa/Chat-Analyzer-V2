As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (29-Dec-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
26/12/23, 8:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Oliver, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.
26/12/23, 8:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!

26/12/23, 9:17 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You're very welcome! 😊 I'm thrilled to hear that you're inspired and ready for the journey ahead. We'll work together closely, and I'm here to guide and support you every step of the way.
26/12/23, 9:18 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So we will commence our session from *29-Dec-23* Friday from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
