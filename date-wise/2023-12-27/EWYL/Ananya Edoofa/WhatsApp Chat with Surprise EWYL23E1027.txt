26/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Amazing, I'm sure we will achieve those goals
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?

26/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes
26/12/23, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
26/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: For today, we need to wrap up our session, and we'll continue this discussion in our next session, which is tomorrow at 1:30 p.m!
26/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes Ma'am
26/12/23, 3:06 PM - +263 71 380 4934: I have understood that the projects in the EWYL program are mainly centered on advertising the Edoofa program in my community so that a lot of ambitious individuals who are hungry for success can get the opportunity to make their dreams a reality. On the other hand  this will help me to be socially connected and to be social media literate. Some projects will even take me as far as having to connect with huge companies in my country helping me to know more about how business formalities are handled. I will have to arrange for video calls and facilitating the signing of contracts. In this I will learn how to deal with rejections, failures and help me develop endurance and also the "try, try again, never give up" attitude. The projects will be split into small activities and I will be helped in carrying out these projects. Apart  from all these skills I will also be awarded scholarship credits upon completion of these activities.
