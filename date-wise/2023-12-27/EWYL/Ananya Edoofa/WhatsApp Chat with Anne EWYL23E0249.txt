I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 4:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Anne!

I hope you all had the merriest Christmas celebration! 🎄 Due to the festive break, our session on Monday had to be called off. No worries, though – I hope you enjoyed the extra time for the festivities.

To make up for it, let's have a compensatory session *tomorrow at 9:30 am*.
I'm looking forward to catching up with all of you! <This message was edited>
