26/12/23, 8:42 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How was your Christmas celebration🎄?

I am so excited to see how you celebrated it with your loved ones and friends, and yes, what all you receive in your gifts🎁?

We will discuss all this in our scheduled session that will be happening from *01:30-02:30 PM* this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday.
Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
26/12/23, 9:52 AM - +263 71 401 4355: Greetings Ms Saloni!.The Christmas celebrations were great💯 though we did not do much rather a family gathering since our culture does not permit us to celebrate Christmas. I would have loved to share the pictures with you but unfortunately I am not a huge fan of the camera😔. And if possible may I be excused for today's session please. The farm workers have not resumed from the holidays yet so I'll be helping out today.
26/12/23, 1:34 PM - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with the session?
26/12/23, 1:36 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad that you had a lovely time with your loved ones and yes, please take today's time. I understand your commitments.
26/12/23, 1:37 PM - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you Ma'am
26/12/23, 3:56 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
