How was your Christmas celebration🎄?

I am so excited to see how you celebrated it with your loved ones and friends, and yes, what all you receive in your gifts🎁?

We will discuss all this in our scheduled session that will be happening from *01:30-02:30 PM* this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday.
Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.

I appreciate you sharing your long-term goals of becoming a successful civil rights attorney, making a positive impact through your work, and contributing to the legal community. It's great that you see the EWYL program as a way to earn while learning and accumulating scholarship credits. Best of luck in achieving your goals!
26/12/23, 1:51 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Thank you ma'am
26/12/23, 1:51 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - +27 63 826 9733: No ma'am I don't
26/12/23, 1:58 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/12/23, 1:59 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/12/23, 2:01 PM - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am
26/12/23, 2:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Persistance, one of my students has _earned around 7,000 USD_ and paid his entire tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.

26/12/23, 2:25 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
