26/12/23, 1:47 pm - Arshita: Thank you for waiting. 

Are you ready to continue?
26/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 430 0087: Yes
26/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
26/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 430 0087: My name is Mercy Maphosa, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I choose to apply for this scholarship because of the profound alignment between it's values and my own aspirations. Your scholarship's focus on empowering students to become change-makers in their communities deeply resonates with my passion for Law. 

From a young age, I have always been passionate about law. This passion has been the driving force behind my academic achievements and extracurricular involvements despite facing financial challenges. I have persevered in my studies, seeking out every opportunity to excel and the Edoofa Scholarship holds profound significance for me; not only as a means to alleviate the financial burden of pursuing higher education, but also as a symbol of belief in my potential. With this support, I am confident that I will be able to devote myself to my studies and make the most of the opportunities that come my way.

It would be absurd of me to not mention how expensive tertiary education is in Zimbabwe, with tuition fees ranging between US$2 300 and US$3 400, that being tuition only, excluding accommodation, study material, transport, food and other costs. With my father being the only one who is employed in our family, he simply cannot afford to put me through tertiary education. He already couldn't afford to do so for my sister who completed secondary school in 2015.

Another reason why I chose The Edoofa Scholarship is that it is verified. I happen to know someone who is a current scholarship recipient. Through her I learnt about the Earn-While-You-Learn Program and I see the good that the scholarship has done her and her family.

In conclusion, I am sincerely grateful for considering my application. With your support I am confident that I will be able to not only achieve my academic goals but also strive to be a socially conscious and compassionate individual, dedicated to serving others. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I eagerly await the opportunity to contribute my best effort and give back to the community that has supported me.
