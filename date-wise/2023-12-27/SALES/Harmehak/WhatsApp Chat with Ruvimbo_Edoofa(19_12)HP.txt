26/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Yes he's the former president of my school
26/12/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: Indeed,

Are you aware we are proudly associated with your school as well, Ruvimbo?
26/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Yes Ms Harmehak
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: I am glad.
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Well Ruvimbo now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
26/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I believe  that studying abroad is a life changing decision because i can get quality education , job opportunities are quite many and living standards are better than here
26/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: You see, Ruvimbo, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there. <This message was edited>
26/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Thank you for understanding Ms Harmehak
26/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: So Ruvimbo, given the opportunity, would you say you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
26/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Yes I am sure I am mentally prepared for a life abroad
26/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Ruvimbo, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
26/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I agree with you on that and yes my family is in support of my plans to study abroad as they're seeing a great opportunity for my success
26/12/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
26/12/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
26/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I am confident Ma'am
26/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I have a question Ms Harmehak
26/12/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
26/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Do I get the opportunity to work there in India after graduation
26/12/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
26/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Okay thank you Ma'am
26/12/23, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Banking and Finance ?
26/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I have 2As ,6Bs and 3Cs.
26/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 886 4487: Then A Level i was doing Pure Maths, Business Studies and Economics

26/12/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 369 0953: Ruvimbo's network connection is poor
26/12/23, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
26/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 78 886 4487: I am interested in in learning about how money works and how to make the most of it..I am also interested in the complex world of economics and how it affects our lives. I want to help people make sound financial decisions and help businesses succeed
