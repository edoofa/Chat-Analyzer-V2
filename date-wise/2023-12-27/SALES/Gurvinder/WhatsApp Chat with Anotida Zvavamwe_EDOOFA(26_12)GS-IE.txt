What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

I have learnt that Edoofa is helping young people to  acquire good education facility in India 

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? I want good education facility which is not there in my country and some of the degrees that are offered in my country are not internationally recognized.
