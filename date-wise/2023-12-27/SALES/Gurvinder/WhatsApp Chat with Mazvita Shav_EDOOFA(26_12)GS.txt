*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
26/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 310 3998: Good morning 
Yes you have

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
26/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 310 3998: Thank you very much for the update,I’ll be awaiting for the assessment of the application.Meanwhile may you kindly highlight on the scholarship and the requirements on my part.
26/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 310 3998: Most appreciated
26/12/23, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, but first Mazvita, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Abdul, is that correct?
26/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
26/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Yess correct

26/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Abdul, also do tell me whether you learnt about Abdul’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?

26/12/23, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share your learnings from them.
26/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 310 3998: My understandings of the program are that it requires a minimum of 2 advanced level passes and presents an opportunity to various African countries to go and pursue their education in India. It helps with issues related to affordability of higher education and makes applicants ready for the work environment.
26/12/23, 9:31 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.
