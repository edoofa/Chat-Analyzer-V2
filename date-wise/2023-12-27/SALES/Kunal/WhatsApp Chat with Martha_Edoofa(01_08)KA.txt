How was your weekend?
25/09/23, 8:21 am - Kunal: Good day to all,

I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal
