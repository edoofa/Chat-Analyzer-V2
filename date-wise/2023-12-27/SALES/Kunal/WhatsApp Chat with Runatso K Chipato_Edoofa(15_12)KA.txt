15/12/23, 1:58 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing about yourself and your family honestly, Runatso
I hope you are aware that studying abroad involves a financial aspect. May I know who will support you financially with your education abroad?
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 289 3104: My pleasure 
We were hoping to apply for a scholarship for my education abroad
15/12/23, 2:17 pm - Kunal: As you know,Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
15/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 289 3104: If found eligible we will be able to raise the founds for cost of living and Transportation

15/12/23, 3:05 pm - Kunal: May I know by when you will be sharing?
15/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 289 3104: In a few minutes 

We are looking for the result slip
15/12/23, 3:05 pm - Kunal: That is fine
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
15/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 289 3104: Iam very confident
15/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 289 3104: This message was deleted

Physics and 
Geography
15/12/23, 3:19 pm - Kunal: Noted
May I know with your interests in Aeronautical Engineering, why didn't you opt for Chemistry at A level?
15/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 289 3104: My interests in Aeronautical Engineering are based on the need to make Zimbabwe a better place in terms of aircrafts with realization of how my country does not have aircraft’s that are eligible for flight I would like to help my fellow citizens to travel from one country to another with our own aircrafts ,creating jobs as we progress.Aeronautical Engineering gives me a chance to explore my passions and interests 
This is because i have grown fond of building and the concept of flying..
15/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 289 3104: I didn’t opt for Chemistry because 
At O level i was not doing any science subject..the class i was attending at O level did not provide for science subjects so I thought it taking both Physics and Chemistry courses at A level would be way harder for me since i did not have the whole background in both the subjects
15/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 289 3104: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 289 3104: I could only get access to this one

15/12/23, 5:58 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand
15/12/23, 5:58 pm - Kunal: While quantity surveying and geography may seem distinct, there can be connections between the two fields, especially in areas related to construction and infrastructure development. Here are some ways in which a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Geography could be linked to quantity surveying:

Spatial Analysis in Construction Planning: Geography students often acquire skills in spatial analysis and mapping. These skills can be valuable in construction planning, where understanding the geographical context of a project site is crucial. Quantity surveyors may use geographic information systems (GIS) to analyze and visualize data related to construction projects.

Environmental Impact Assessment: Geography students often study environmental issues. In construction projects, especially large-scale ones, environmental impact assessments are essential. Quantity surveyors working on such projects may collaborate with individuals who have a background in geography to assess and mitigate environmental impacts.

Urban Planning and Development: Geography students with a focus on urban studies may have insights into urban planning principles. Quantity surveyors involved in construction projects within urban areas may benefit from understanding the spatial and social dynamics of the built environment.

Infrastructure Development: Geography encompasses the study of physical landscapes. Understanding the physical geography of an area is crucial for infrastructure development. Quantity surveyors may work with geographic data to assess the terrain, geological conditions, and other factors influencing construction costs.

Sustainable Construction Practices: Geography students with a focus on sustainability can contribute to quantity surveying projects that prioritize environmentally friendly and sustainable construction practices. This collaboration can lead to more eco-conscious and cost-effective solutions.
