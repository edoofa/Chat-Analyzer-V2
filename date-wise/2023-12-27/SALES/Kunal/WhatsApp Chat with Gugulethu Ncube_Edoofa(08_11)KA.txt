It's clear that Edoofa is committed to making education accessible and affordable for everyone, and I think that's a really admirable goal. I'm curious to know more about the process of finding and selecting scholarship recipients - can you

Alright so, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

*1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination*
*2. The course you would like to study and why*
*3. What do your parents do (their profession)*
*4. What is your parent’s highest education level?*
*5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?*
*6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far*
*7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad*
*8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $?*
08/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 462 1253: I'll start by saying that my strengths include my creativity, my strong work ethic, and my ability to think outside the box. My weaknesses include my tendency to procrastinate and my lack of patience. My hobbies include reading novels . My family is very close-knit and supportive of each other, and we often spend time together doing things like  watching movies. My current educational level is Advanced level (L5)  and my subject combination is English literature, history and sociology. A degree in sociology can provide a strong foundation for a career in social worker because it teaches students to understand and analyze complex social issues. It also helps to develop important skills like critical thinking, communication and problems solving. My mother is self employed and my father passed away. My aunt is the one who is financially supporting me for my education. My aunt will also support my higher education abroad. My per - term fee in school is $205.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
