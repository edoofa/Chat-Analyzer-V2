I would like to study medicine (Dermatology)

Preferred year of Admission: August 2024

After interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship, I learn that there are projects done by students which gives income and that income pays the school fees of learners.

I should be accepted into the Edoofa Program because I am a well mannered girl and I have all the qualifications that they need. Also they should accept me because it is my biggest dream to study abroad
