*I am Ms Tushti, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

22/12/23, 9:28 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
22/12/23, 3:50 pm - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

23/12/23, 10:32 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

24/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 299 6183: I am a dynamic student from Zimbabwe, who is going to be in Upper Sixth in 2024 at Mabvuku High School located in Mashonalanda East Province.

Nelson Mandela once said, "Education is the most powerful weapon one can use to change the world." and l am very sure that l do have  strength in using this weapon to make the world a better place.

 Yes! I do have some weaknesses in several sports activities like rugby, soccer and so on, but in some of the extra curriculum activities, l am better for example chess, quiz and so on.

I would like to study medicine as l am passionated with medicine, since childhood. Currently my combination at A level is:
1. Pure Mathematics
2. Physics
3. Chemistry
4. Statistics

I am a male student from a well humbled family of six.
 Five siblings that are married and unemployed, and my beloved mother who is self-employed and sustain my educational needs after a series of hardworking.

My Father passed away when I was in form 2 and he was the breadwinner of the family.
After his death my family members are now struggling to fulfill all my basic educational needs for example struggling to pay a maximum amount of $90 of school fees at my current school.

It is clear right now that all my family members will not be able to sustain me with all my tertiary educational needs in 2025.
Those are some of the reasons why I am seeking help Ms Tushti, Mr Shubhan, Mr Jyotishman and all respected members  of EDOOFA.

I thank you.
