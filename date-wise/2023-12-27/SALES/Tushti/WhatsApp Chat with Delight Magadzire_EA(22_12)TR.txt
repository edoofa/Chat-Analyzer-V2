26/12/23, 10:44 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
26/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 078 1782: Yes. Correct
26/12/23, 10:46 am - Tushti: Alright so Delight, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination
2. The course you would like to study and why
3. What do your parents do (their profession)
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far
7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad
8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $?
9. Name of your school and the province in which it is located
26/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 078 1782: My name is Delight Magadzire, and I was born on August 14, 2004. I enjoy playing table tennis and got the best player of the the year award in football , and I'm quite skilled at geography and sociology.My weakness is that l have public speaking anxiety since my primary school education but l have been working on that area by participating in public speaking at my secondary school. My strengths are that l am good at time managment , balancing priorities and perfectionism in everything that l do.Three of the four children in my birth family are boys, and one is a girl.As I wait for my results, I have finished my Advanced level study (Cambridge syllabus). My mother stays at home and my father works as a mechanic. The highest degree of education achieved by my parents is ordinary level. My entire education up to this point has been provided by my father. In addition, my father will be the one to finance my study overseas. Two of my siblings are still enrolled in school; one  in secondary education and the younger one in primary education, and my sister has just finished her public administration degree. Each term, I paid $200 USD in school fees. Golden Springs Cambridge Learning Center in Highlands is the name of the school, which is situated in the province of Harare.
26/12/23, 1:33 pm - Tushti: Thank you, dear
26/12/23, 1:33 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
26/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 078 1782: Yes they are especially when we are surviving from 1 source of income
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
26/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 078 1782: How much are the fees?
26/12/23, 5:33 pm - Tushti: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you  again at *09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
