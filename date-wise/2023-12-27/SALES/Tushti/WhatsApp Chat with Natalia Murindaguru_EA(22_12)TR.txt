26/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 841 6232: What motivated me to apply for this scholarship is the high education facilities that you offer...I have the potential to excel but lack the necessary resources to pursue higher education.

26/12/23, 10:39 am - Tushti: Excellent
26/12/23, 10:39 am - Tushti: Alright, let me give you a brief introduction to the Program you have applied for

26/12/23, 10:39 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

26/12/23, 1:32 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
26/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 841 6232: It's okay
26/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 841 6232: Yes we are facing such a situation but all in all my father is trying <This message was edited>

26/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 841 6232: When it comes to my education my father covers the expenses because he knows how education is important...and as I said before he's self employed so I'm very sure he will manage
26/12/23, 1:52 pm - Tushti: I would like for the parent to answer
26/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 841 6232: Okay
26/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 158 8160: Good day ma'am /sir
I as a parent i will definitely pay the fees for my child as long as this thing is legit. I will definitely support her

26/12/23, 5:33 pm - Tushti: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you  again at *09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good day ahead.
