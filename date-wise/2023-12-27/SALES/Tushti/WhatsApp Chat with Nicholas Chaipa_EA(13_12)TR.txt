16/12/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: Adding to your knowledge you see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/12/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. United College of Education, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected Sir Adam Luthuli has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
16/12/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
16/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 588 7600: Yes it is
16/12/23, 4:37 pm - Tushti: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on *Monday at 9:30 am* Please be online during your session time!

21/12/23, 9:47 am - Tushti: I was expecting a reply here
21/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 588 7600: Im Nicholas Chaipa live in Mutare Zimbabwe, in Manicaland. Im 19 years now and im now heading into my final year of Advanced level. Im doing home schooling as all schools offering Cambridge syllabus in my city were expensive the likes of Hillcrest, Princeton et cetra. Im doing 3 subjects Mathematics, Physics and Geography, obviously im taking both advanced supplementary and advanced level. With these subjects, im looking forward to pass with 10 points abd above as im a hard working guy. I had 2A* one in Maths(91%), 3 A's including Geography(81%) and (85%) in combined science. However, apart from academic side im a footballer and im playing in Division 2 here at Harlem United and im looking forward to join South African league if things goes as per our plans with Mr Gore. I would like to take Civil Engineering if im that lucky to get a scholarship from your organization. I live with both of my parents. My father is a salesman. He works in Electrosales here in Mutare. He dropped school at O level due to financial problem and he began to work as he said. As for my mother, she doesn't have any formal job, infact she doesn't work. We are six children in our family and im the second born. My sister is the first born and she is at Chinhoyi University were she is taking software engineering. It will be an advantage for my father if i get 100% scholarship as my father is under pressure due to school fees for other siblings of mine as my little brothers(4) are all at school too
21/12/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: Thank you for your introduction, dear. May I know whether you are in L5 or U6 currently
21/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 588 7600: I beg your pardon you mean this year or...... Because we are  now preparing for next year, next level too as we are on holiday

21/12/23, 10:14 am - Tushti: Noted
21/12/23, 10:14 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
21/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 588 7600: Yes, they are huge arrears in there schools and they are not given there reports every term due to those outstandings

21/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 71 588 7600: Now my father is at work and my mother is not around too unfortunately
21/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 71 588 7600: I do not know, but i think they will not manage honestly speaking
21/12/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: Parent participation is mandatory for the session
21/12/23, 10:51 am - Tushti: We cannot proceed until they have joined us

21/12/23, 4:02 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 9:28 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?

22/12/23, 10:12 am - Tushti: Kindly ask them to come online and join the discussion
22/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 588 7600: Okay
22/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 233 3292: Hello madam, how are you? I am Nicholas ' father
22/12/23, 10:34 am - Tushti: I hope you shall answer this question for me
22/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 233 3292: It's ok mom
22/12/23, 10:41 am - Tushti: I shall wait for the answe
22/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 233 3292: Honestly it's hard in our third world country like Zimbabwe with such high inflation we are going through. The only option is to source donations from donors to fund his education.
22/12/23, 10:44 am - Tushti: @263772333292 let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 233 3292: True , thanks very much for explaining we didn't know until then.  However obviously we will try by all means possible to look for his upkeep there ,
22/12/23, 10:56 am - Tushti: Do you feel the family would be able to raise around $2000 for your child's higher education?
22/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 233 3292: Is it a once off payment or is staggered?
22/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 233 3292: Truely is a lot of money
22/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 233 3292: But it it's paid quarterly or  monthly
22/12/23, 11:33 am - Tushti: The payment can be made in two installments
22/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 233 3292: It's hard but let me dig deep for sponsorship here locally
22/12/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: Do you wish to put this application on hold until you are better prepared for it?
22/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 233 3292: No you can go ahead with the processing
22/12/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: If the student is selected now, the enrollment fee of $350 would have to be paid in a week
22/12/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: Would you be able to do so?
