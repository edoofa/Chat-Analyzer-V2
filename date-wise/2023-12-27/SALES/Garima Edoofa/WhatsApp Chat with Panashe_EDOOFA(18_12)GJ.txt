Social Change and Advocacy: Journalistic reporting on societal issues like gender equality, environmental concerns, education, healthcare, and poverty often leads to public discourse and policy changes, contributing to social progress.

Cultural Reflection: Journalism reflects the diverse cultural landscape of India. It showcases the country's cultural richness, traditions, languages, and heritage, promoting understanding and unity among different communities.

Media Watchdog: Journalists act as watchdogs, scrutinizing and critiquing media itself. They evaluate media ethics, biases, and the impact of news reporting on society.

Fostering Debate and Discourse: Journalism encourages dialogue and debate on critical issues. Opinion pieces, editorials, and panel discussions enable diverse viewpoints, shaping public opinion and encouraging civic engagement.

Technology and Innovation: With the advent of digital media, journalism in India has evolved rapidly. New technologies and online platforms have expanded reach, enabling real-time reporting, citizen journalism, and interactive storytelling.

Educational and Career Opportunities: Journalism offers career prospects for aspiring writers, reporters, editors, photographers, and media professionals. Journalism schools and programs provide educational opportunities for aspiring journalists.

20/12/23, 8:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 276 0664: yes maam we may proceed
20/12/23, 10:36 am - Garima Edoofa: Panashe I would like you to answer this question that I have asked?
20/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 276 0664: Yes we are all aware of the expenses
20/12/23, 10:53 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

20/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 276 0664: okk i understand
20/12/23, 11:00 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/12/23, 11:26 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Panashe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?* <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 11:32 am - Garima Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, it is my lunch break and we'll be connecting shortly after 1 hour.
20/12/23, 12:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: Panashe are we still connected?
20/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 276 0664: yes maam

20/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 276 0664: Yes i went throuqh
20/12/23, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like you to answer this question that I have asked?
20/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 276 0664: Yes maam i would like to know about it
20/12/23, 1:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/12/23, 1:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 276 0664: ok ok
20/12/23, 1:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

20/12/23, 1:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
20/12/23, 1:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
20/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 276 0664: ok
20/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 276 0664: Yes this will benefit me as i will be able to earn will learning it will also improve my financial problems
20/12/23, 3:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/12/23, 3:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/12/23, 3:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 276 0664: yes i do realize
20/12/23, 3:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.     Earn While You Learn: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
20/12/23, 3:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
20/12/23, 4:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
