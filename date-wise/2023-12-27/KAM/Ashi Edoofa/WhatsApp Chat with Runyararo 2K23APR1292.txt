26/12/23, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?

The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Tuesday (2nd January) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
26/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
