26/12/23, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Crystal ,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

Firstly, I am delighted to inform you that the payment you have made for the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly in order to ensure a seamless transition in your application process.
26/12/23, 6:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
26/12/23, 6:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
26/12/23, 6:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
26/12/23, 6:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
