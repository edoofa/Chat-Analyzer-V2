I hope this message finds you well. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa and I am delighted to inform you that I will be your dedicated admission officer from here on.

Today, I wanted to take a moment to reach out and introduce myself. As I will be reviewing your scholarship application file to gain insight into the latest procedures you discussed with Mr. Shivjeet. This will enable us to pick up our discussion from where it left off.
