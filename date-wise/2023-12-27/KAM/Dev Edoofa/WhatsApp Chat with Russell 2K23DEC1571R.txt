Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

26/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 71 399 6403: I was inspired by the Edoofa vision of offering accessible and affordable education for all, the EWYL program which offers students a chance to reduce their tuition fees and gain valuable job skills 
And finally  the dedication which is manifested in the Edoofa student care team to guide their students in the path  which leads to success
26/12/23, 1:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Earn while you Learn program provides the opportunity to the hardworking students to self-finance their higher education on top of the scholarship provided in the Edoofa scholarship program.

This program also assists the students to have a finesse on skills that are pre-requisites before venturing into any field and climb the ladder of success.

3. Identity proof (International Travelling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate).
26/12/23, 1:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
26/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 71 399 6403: By   April in 2024  when schools will close
26/12/23, 2:13 PM - +263 71 399 6403: But immediately when  the schools open l should request for the document to be produced
26/12/23, 2:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am having a little problem understanding this, may I please know that if you will be able to provide the letter of recommendation by April 2024 or the A-level results by  April 2024?
26/12/23, 2:18 PM - +263 71 399 6403: I mean the letter of recommendation
The A level results will be released in  February 2025
26/12/23, 2:24 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know and I have taken a note of it.
But April is five months away and other students are able to get their Letter of Recommendation within a single day, so please let me know, if you are facing any issue or have a particular reason for the delay?
26/12/23, 2:28 PM - +263 71 399 6403: The challenge  is on how to send the letter to you since cellphones are not allowed at school
26/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 71 399 6403: What l can do is to send the letter to my mother from a school teacher's cellphone so that she can forward it to you
26/12/23, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: You may get it printed from the school itself. It would not require you to use cellphone.
26/12/23, 2:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: This is also a viable option to consider.
Whichever you are comfortable with.
26/12/23, 2:38 PM - +263 71 399 6403: Okay that is  a better plan, so then I will have to send it to mom from school right
26/12/23, 2:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Russell, if you are comfortable with it.
26/12/23, 2:39 PM - +263 71 399 6403: It is l have no problem with  it

26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Dev Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have sessions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have sessions scheduled on need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
26/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 71 399 6403: From 1230 to 1330
26/12/23, 2:49 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s session at this time. It's important to note that all three forms with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow before our session and as for the academic documents, you need to provide it by this Friday, i.e., 29th December.

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?

26/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 71 399 6403: However I can only produce the O level results since l have not yet written  my Alevel examination
26/12/23, 3:02 PM - Dev Edoofa: yes, surely.
