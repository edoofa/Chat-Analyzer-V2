I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. Thank you for sharing the receipt for the last part of your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
