21/12/23, 5:21 AM - +260 97 5963257: Greetings to you ALL, on behalf of Natasha and my family we wish first of all to thank you for according her the chance to secure a scholarship through your organisation.  However, due to circumstances beyond our control as a family we have decided to withdraw from this programme.  We regret any incomvenience caused in this regard.  Thank you.
21/12/23, 9:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well. I appreciate you letting me know about your decision to potentially leave the program. It's completely your right to make this decision as a family, and I respect that. However, I must admit that I'm a bit disheartened because of the reason Natasha initially gave. If your concerns are about our authenticity, I'm eager to address any doubts you might have. We are committed to ensuring Natasha's future and I distinctly recall the case she shared above. If you'd like to discuss this further, we're more than willing to talk.
21/12/23, 9:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: An organization that has bad intentions would likely avoid open discussions, but that's not our approach here because we are confident if this would have been the case why would more than 3000+ students trust us and would be in India under our program. If there are other worries or questions you have, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share them with me.
5/1/24, 3:32 PM - +260 97 5963257: Greetings, on behalf of Natasha family we would like to find out the possibility of getting a refund of the partial University registration fees of $287 made in November 2023.  This is arising from the fact that we have withdrawn from the scholarship offered to Natasha.  Submitted for your guidance.
5/1/24, 7:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Natasha.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for reaching out regarding the same. However, let me help you understand the refund policy if we as an organization, fail to provide you with offer letter then only you will be eligible for a refund, however, that is not the case here.
5/1/24, 7:13 PM - +260 97 5963257: Oh ok.  It is fine thank you.
5/1/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please you are most welcome, may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
