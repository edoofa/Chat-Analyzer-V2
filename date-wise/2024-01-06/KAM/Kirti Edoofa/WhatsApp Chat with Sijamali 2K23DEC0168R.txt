And thank for the guidance. 
We are just waiting anxiously for the response regarding the offer letter from the universities Sijamali's application was sent to.

And happy new year. 
Am making a follow up if there has been a response from any university you sent Sijamali's application. 
It'd been a while and we have not heard from you regarding the same. 
Thank you.
5/1/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and SIjamali.

I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful New Year celebration thank you for your wish. I understand your concern here however, this is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
5/1/24, 7:21 PM - +260 96 2284130: Thank you for your response. 
More time indeed I need. 
You are absolutely right.
5/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a wonderful evening ahead!
5/1/24, 7:33 PM - +260 96 2284130: Thank you.  Stay blessed.
