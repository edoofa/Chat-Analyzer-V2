I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion, I wanted to reach out and check if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?

26/12/23, 9:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you earlier, but as there hasn't been a response that time and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

I hope you're doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, I was occupied with work meetings. I wanted to reach out to schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 06:00 pm CAT. I hope you will be available.

29/12/23, 6:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/12/23, 9:42 PM - +263 77 598 7016: Good evening ma'am I'm sorry for not being available
29/12/23, 9:43 PM - +263 77 598 7016: It was beyond my control
29/12/23, 10:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, not attending the discussions and sharing your concerns is not my loss, your deadline was today and through your lack of communication, you are losing on to an international scholarship opportunity. My job is to assist you but if you are not willing to put in efforts to share your concern I am sorry I will not be able to assist you. Now I would love to continue with our discussion, however, as it has been a long day for me, and my available hours for today are over. I will connect with you on Tuesday since we will not be available during the long weekend. As we stand on the threshold of a new year, I extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. May this year bring new opportunities, fresh beginnings, and the realization of your dreams and aspirations.

I hope the coming year is filled with success, health, and happiness for you and your loved ones. May it be a year that surpasses all expectations and is replete with moments of joy and achievement.

Wishing you a Happy New Year⭐
