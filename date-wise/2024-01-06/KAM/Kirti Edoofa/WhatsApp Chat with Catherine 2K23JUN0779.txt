As the university has set a deadline of December 29, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $325, or you can opt to pay the full $650 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
28/12/23, 6:55 PM - +263 77 303 1875: I had considered paying in 2 instalments
28/12/23, 7:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
28/12/23, 7:14 PM - +263 77 303 1875: Yes Ma'am.I prefer to deposit $325  plus transfer charges into Mr Shorwi's FBC account on the 18th of January and also the other
28/12/23, 7:14 PM - +263 77 303 1875: The 2nd instalment of $325 plus transfer charges on the 18th of February.
28/12/23, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I want to inform you regarding the deadline, @263773031875 if a student misses the university's specified due date, they may lose the opportunity, making it crucial to adhere to the deadline.
28/12/23, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Considering you've brought this concern to our attention in a timely manner, I believe we can discuss the matter with university officials to explore a solution that prevents Catherine from missing out on this valuable scholarship opportunity. This scholarship serves as the initial stepping stone for her to access higher-quality education and pave the way for a successful career.
28/12/23, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To assist you effectively, I would appreciate a more detailed understanding of your situation. This will enable us to align your needs with the university's policies and find a suitable solution. Could you please let me know your the challenges that you are facing?
29/12/23, 7:19 AM - +263 77 303 1875: Thank you Ma'am.
29/12/23, 7:22 AM - +263 77 303 1875: As a self employed tailor specializing more on school uniforms in our rural school im preparing for the uniforms taking into consideration that in the first term of the new year they will be enrolling new students mainly the form ones.
29/12/23, 7:27 AM - +263 77 303 1875: They give me the orders only without the down payment,so i have to source for all the production costs on my own and deliver only to be paid after the sales.By the time the offer letter reached me i had already exhausted all my finances to do the consignment.Thats the challenge i have faced Ma'am.But i wouldn't want to loose that opportunity for my daughter.
29/12/23, 1:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. I completely understand your challenge here. Considering you've brought this concern to our attention. To assist you effectively I would like to understand how much have to raised so far and how much will you be able to raise by 31st December 2023?
29/12/23, 2:33 PM - +263 77 303 1875: So far i have nothing because i have so school logos to be printed also as below.
29/12/23, 2:36 PM - +263 77 303 1875: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773031875 I fully comprehend your situation. However, it's important to note that these deadlines are set by the university. I am willing to discuss your case for a possible extension, given the legitimacy of your concern. To facilitate this, a partial deposit to reserve Catherine's seat would be necessary. This step is crucial for the university to consider an extension, as it demonstrates commitment and allows the university to justify an extension as they must maintain fairness to all students and cannot reserve Catherine's seat until the 18th of January.
29/12/23, 3:12 PM - +263 77 303 1875: In this case Ma'am im sorry my hands are tied.
29/12/23, 4:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773031875 thank you for letting me know that. I was just hoping that you could borrow at least $100 to reserve Catherine's seat with the university and then I could have discussed your case for an extension. I certainly understand that, however, January will be a long time, since the universities have to be fair with all the students. I can have a conversation with the university and help you process your admission as a regular application by 18th January, but that would mean letting go of the Endowment Grant of $100, and you will need to deposit $750. If you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out. However, sir, that cannot be done if you do not understand the importance of these due dates. <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 4:19 PM - +263 77 303 1875: I understand everything you have said Ms Kirti and your Admin.However I plead with you to plead for me for the extension of the dates ,its so unfortunate that im loosing the $100 Endowment Grant ,i will definitely pay the $750 in 2 instalments.Thank you.
29/12/23, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773031875 Thank you for sharing that however, I hope you understand that processing your application normally means you would have to make the payment of $750 at once however, since your concern is genuine I can have a discussion and help you with a flexible payment plan for the deposit of $750.
29/12/23, 4:32 PM - +263 77 303 1875: Thank you so much Ma'am,i really appreciate your consideration.
29/12/23, 4:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I will be able to update you on Tuesday after having a discussion with the university. I hope you will be available on Tuesday.
29/12/23, 5:08 PM - +263 77 303 1875: Yes Ma'am i will be available.

2/1/24, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now I was able to have a conversation with the academic board regarding your concern and they did consider your concern a genuine one since you will not longer be able to get the Endowments benefit, I presented a strong case, and discussed whether you would be able to pay $750 in two installments, and the academic board did approve the extension because of your transparent communication and genuine concern.
2/1/24, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To ensure alignment with your preferences, I would like to get a confirmation from your end for the same payment plan. If you find this plan acceptable. Hence, I would like to know if you are comfortable with the following payment plan, and do you believe it aligns with your financial capabilities?

1. $375 before 18th January 2024 
2. $375 before 18th Feburary 2024

2/1/24, 9:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, on that note, please write an email to "academicboard@edoofa.com" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti about the cause of the delay in your registration fee and state the reason why and even mention that you willing are okay to let go of the Endowment Plan, the date and amount that you will pay, that is $375 before 18th January 2024.

I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
5/1/24, 10:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting today as I was occupied with a meeting. Given that the day has been quite lengthy for me and we're at the end of our working hours, I suggest we resume our discussion at 08:30 am tomorrow. I'm hopeful you'll be available at that time. Wishing you a wonderful evening, and I eagerly await our conversation tomorrow.
