29/12/23, 1:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773902651 Alright please, you can update me about the same when you are connected with the school.

29/12/23, 1:02 PM - +263 77 390 2651: We can proceed
29/12/23, 1:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/12/23, 1:08 PM - +263 77 390 2651: We can start
29/12/23, 1:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:11 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Done
29/12/23, 1:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/12/23, 1:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/12/23, 1:13 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Quite clear
29/12/23, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/12/23, 1:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/12/23, 1:18 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Following
29/12/23, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 1:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 1:21 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Oh ok so this is paid before coming to India?
29/12/23, 1:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, you are absolutely correct, as your counselor informed you in your counseling sessions. This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
29/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Well explained
29/12/23, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Thus fine
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/12/23, 1:54 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Ready but network challenges now it's raining heavily

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

29/12/23, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
29/12/23, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

3/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
3/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
3/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
3/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
3/1/24, 7:20 PM - +263 77 390 2651: Thank you
3/1/24, 7:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
3/1/24, 7:58 PM - +263 77 949 9509: Yes ma'am
3/1/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
3/1/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

4/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 77 949 9509: 2. Soil fertility refers to the ability of soil to sustain agricultural plant growth, i.e. to provide plant habitat and result in sustained and consistent yields of high quality. It also refers to the soil's ability to supply plant/crop nutrients in the right quantities and qualities over a sustainable period of time.
4/1/24, 12:53 PM - +263 77 949 9509: *Question*: How can soil fertility be improved?
*Answer*: Soil fertility can be further improved by incorporating cover crops that add organic matter to the soil, which leads to improved soil structure and promotes a healthy, fertile soil; by using green manure or growing legumes to fix nitrogen from the air through the process of biological nitrogen fixation; by micro-dose . . .

*Question*: How can we check the fertility of soil?
*Answer*: The measurement of the fertility of soils is usually done by chemical analysis for plant nutrients such as nitrogen (N), potassium (K), phosphorus (P) and trace elements, as well as physical measurements of soil structure.

Contemporary practices subsistence farming continues today in large parts of rural Africa , and part of Asia and Latin America. Subsistence farmers farm for survival, and usually do not look to make a profit off the crops that they grow.
Commercial agriculture is practised virtually whenever it is capable of growing crops or raising livestock, but primarily in areas with the highest growth potential. It is usually found in more developed countries, and the crops are grown in huge quantities to support entire populations for a profit.
Subsistence farming, form of farming in which nearly all of the crops or livestock raised are used to maintain the farmer and the farmer's family, leaving little, if any surplus for sale or trade.
Commercial farming heps countries in the world earn a high foreign exchange. It is being purely for profit. It is also used for commercial use including cafeterias, restaurant and soup kitchen.

Insecticides kill insects and other arthropods. Miticides also called acaricides kill mites that feed on plants and animals. Microbial pesticides are microorganisms that kill , inhibit , or out -compete pests , including insects or other microorganisms pests.
Molluscicides kill snails and slugs.
Pesticides are used in agriculture to control weeds , insect infestation and diseases . There are many different types of pesticides, each is meant to be effective against specific pests . 
Any harmful effects that occur from small doses repeated over a period time are termed chronic effects. Suspected chronic effects from exposure to certain pesticides include birth defects , toxicity to a fetus , production of benign or malignant tumours , genetic changes , blood disorders, nerve disorders, endocrine.
Some pesticides for example the organophosphates , can cause severe symptoms, like convulsious , coma and possibly even death.
5/1/24, 9:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the questions, however, since it is past our available time now let us reconnect tomorrow as we discussed above.

5/1/24, 10:40 PM - +263 77 949 9509: 5. Higher crop productivity . Decreased use of water , fertilizer, and pesticides which turn keeps food prices down . Reduced impact on natural ecosystems.
Furthermore, technologies offers precise recommendations on the use of fertilizers and pesticides, reducing input costs and minimising the environmental impact. For instance , using satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies, we can detect sub the cahnges in crop health and respond quickly to any emerging issues. Technology leads immense support in automating various tasks, setting up reminders , communicating effeciently , paying bills at the click of buttom and shopping for the simplest things such as groceries to investing in value assets right in the comfort of our homes.
New technologies can lead to the development of new products and services. This can create new markets and opportunities for businesses, which can also lead to economic growth. Increased efficiency. New technologies can help businesses to operate more efficiently . Precision agriculture involves using GPS and other technological tools to collect data on crops and soil to optimize inputs based on specific conditions.
