I hope you are doing well and blessed. It has been a really long time since the last time we were connected and I want to check up on you now. Over the past couple of days I have been trying to reach out to you and all my efforts are in vain. I have also noticed that my messages were also seen by you. If you are getting my latest message. I would like you Please drop a reply so that we can commence on the admission process so that we do not miss out on the opportunities that lies ahead.
