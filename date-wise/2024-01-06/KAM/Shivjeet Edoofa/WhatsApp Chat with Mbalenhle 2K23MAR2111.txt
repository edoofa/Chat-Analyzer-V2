I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. I can also see that you have seen my messages. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*. It has already been 5 months now.


I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session, or let me know if you are facing any challenges so that we can discuss this better.
