4/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, Nigel, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
4/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
4/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
4/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
4/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
4/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

They are used by the Financial Accounting Standards Board as the foundation for its comprehensive set of approved accounting practices and methods. GAAP makes the financial reporting process transparent and standardizes assumptions,terminology,definitions and methods. External parties can easily compare financial statements and safely assume consistency which allows for quick and accurate cross company comparisons. They enable investors and stakeholders to make sound,evidence based decisions. The consistency of GAAP also allows companies to more easily evaluate strategic business options. However,GAAP is not a global financial reporting,it makes it hard to use GAAP accounting for business that have overseas operations,Also GAAP does not account for the diversity among companies and uses the same principles for all kinds of business in an industry,this could make using GAAP difficult for small companies and other diverse businesses
