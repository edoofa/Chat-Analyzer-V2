20/12/23, 1:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 1:45 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Good bye
Thank you for everything

And all the best
26/12/23, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nellie ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 2:52 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Good afternoon

Yes am ready
26/12/23, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @265993652542. Before we start our session, May I know if you remember the benefit shared by Mr. Shivjeet?
26/12/23, 4:16 PM - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes I do
26/12/23, 4:20 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: A reminder please on the benefits please and good afternoon miss Ashi.
I'm Nellie's dad.
26/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, Let's start from the beginning.
26/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/12/23, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/12/23, 4:49 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Thanks very much we can now proceed.
26/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @265881351489, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/12/23, 9:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, As I was looking forward for your response. I am scheduling our session for tomorrow at 2:00 pm. I hope you will be available for the session.
26/12/23, 9:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nellie, Wishing you a good day!
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With reference to our yesterday conversation, you left the conversation in between. However, I am eager to know if you are ready for today's session, Could you please share your response with us?
27/12/23, 2:06 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: We just followed on the reminder on the benefits and we were well updated and I propose that you may continue from where you stopped yesterday and we will be following,no questions at the moment as from me just waiting for the university selection list updates.Thank you.
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @265881351489, Let's continue with the second benefit please.
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 2:14 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: This is noted.
27/12/23, 2:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
27/12/23, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 2:18 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Noted as well
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/12/23, 2:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/12/23, 2:20 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: May be the school list and do the fees comparison.
27/12/23, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265881351489 I understand your question however I would like to share that this is not possible as there 250+ universities which we are associated with however, I would like to mention that you will be given the opportunity to do the same when you will receive the offer letter from multiple university. I hope you understand?
27/12/23, 2:33 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: I understand and we will be waiting but wanted to see if we can have ample to prepare from our side as well.
27/12/23, 2:33 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Time.
27/12/23, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @265881351489. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/12/23, 2:39 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Please give me an insight.
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/12/23, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/12/23, 2:44 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Cleared now but on our case which category are we I mean basing on Nellie's previous undertaking performance?.
27/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265881351489 As Nellie has already completed the MSCE examination, these benefits are for those students who are yet to receive their results please.
27/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 2:47 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: No please and you may proceed.
27/12/23, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So,are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/12/23, 2:49 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Let's proceed please.
27/12/23, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
27/12/23, 2:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
27/12/23, 2:57 PM - +265 881 35 14 89: Thank you very much for your responses, and your time as well looking forward to hearing from you soon.
27/12/23, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @265881351489, Have a good day ahead!
30/12/23, 5:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Nellie ,
