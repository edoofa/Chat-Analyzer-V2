Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024.

5/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 653 5956: Since a lot of students are taking BA LlB it seems they will be stiff competition when it comes to employment whilst taking the same programm. 
What we need is employment after studying
