Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM
Monday to Friday, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM
Let me know which one suits your schedule best.
5/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh it is nice to interact with you ma'am . Yes ma'am I am ready to join you on this journey .
5/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 71 401 8032: The second slot will work ma'am though there might be some problems in meeting this time since I will be at school at that time and also we are not allowed to use mobile phones at school.
5/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Hello Ms Ananya, how are you and work. Here we are fine. I am happy to interact with you on this platform. My name is Walter Mushambi and l am Wynne's parent/father. Thank you for the scheduled times for the sessions with Wynne. However during these times or hours he will be at school and the school does not allow him to have a phone at school. May you kindly help by having the sessions with him from 3:30 pm to 4:30 pm. By this time he will be now at home where he will be now free to use the phone. May you kindly help on this one  so that Wynne will not lose any of your sessions and also so that the school not treat him as someone who is mischievous.
