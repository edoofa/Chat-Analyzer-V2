And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 1:44 PM - +263 78 610 6366: An echo

How are you doing today? Shall we begin our session?
4/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Iam well and you 

We can start
4/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
4/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 610 6366: No
4/1/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Can you please elaborate the two key objectives for me <This message was edited>
4/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
4/1/24, 1:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
4/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Noted thank you
4/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Duly understood thank you
4/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
4/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Yes lam very excited
4/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
4/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Noted ma'am thank you will go through it now
4/1/24, 2:15 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
4/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 610 6366: The Edoofa inspiration hall whereby young girls from different schools are doing  projects in Zimbabwe that are developing and benefiting the society and l was truly inspired as they were teens of my same age group thank you for sharing this article with me
4/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!
4/1/24, 2:30 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since our session time is over, let us connect tomorrow at the same time. I am so happy about your consistency. Maintain this, and I promise that we will excel in this program!
4/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Thank you ma'am have a great day
5/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Good afternoon maam
5/1/24, 1:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nicole!

Every day is a new beginning, take a deep breath and start afresh. On this note, let us begin our session and make a change together! ☀️🌼
5/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Good afternoon ma'am
5/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
5/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Thank you ma'am let us begin apologies for the late response lam having some network issues
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 610 6366: Sounds great ma'am
5/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
5/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Yes ma'am
5/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
5/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 77 272 2801: Noted ma'am
5/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session 10 minutes earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
