I hope you are doing well. As we embark on our first session of 2024, I'm eager to catch up and dive into our exciting plans for the year ahead, especially considering your arrival in India. C'mon, join your EWYL Line for your session!

I'm disappointed to see that you missed today's session. It's crucial to be responsible and attend on time. A lack of punctuality affects not just your progress but also the overall effectiveness of our mentoring. Let's take this seriously, and I expect better attendance in the future. Punctuality is a non-negotiable part of our commitment. Ensure you're on time for our next session.
