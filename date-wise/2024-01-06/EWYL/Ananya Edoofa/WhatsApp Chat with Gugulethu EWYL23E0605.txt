23/12/23, 12:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Gugulethu!

How are you today? I understand it's the holiday season, but there's a crucial hands-on training session for the $300 plan in India that has been pending since you arrived late. I was hoping to complete that training today. I've set aside a 30-minute slot specifically for you because I know how important it is for you to progress and work hard, earning credits just like your fellow Edoofians!

Could you let me know if you are available today at 7:00 p.m.?

23/12/23, 4:31 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *1. Different channels for finding potential students*

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
23/12/23, 4:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
