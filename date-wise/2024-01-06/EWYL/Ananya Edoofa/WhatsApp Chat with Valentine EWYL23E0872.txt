Before we dive into today's session, I'm curious – how was your New Year? Did you have a chance to celebrate and welcome the new chapter?
2/1/24, 1:40 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Good afternoon Mentor

2/1/24, 1:45 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Congratulations for being blessed into a new year.
2/1/24, 1:51 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
2/1/24, 1:59 PM - +27 71 622 8502: My name is Valentine Madzvara. I live in a small village where I show interest in education , my favorite topics lies in numbers and biology. I use my spare time with my father ,feeding animals. I also play soccer and chess with my friends.
2/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Valentine! It's great to meet you. Your interest in education, particularly in numbers and biology, is fantastic! Exploring diverse subjects like that can open up so many possibilities. Spending spare time with your father and feeding animals sounds like a wonderful bonding activity. Soccer and chess with friends add a nice mix of physical and mental stimulation. Keep enjoying those activities and nurturing your passions! If you ever want to chat about numbers, biology, soccer, or anything else, feel free to reach out. Cheers! 👋⚽🔢🔬
2/1/24, 2:03 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Thank you.
2/1/24, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I. Mago is my mother and she might not be online currently but I'm sure she will respond as soon as she gets online.
2/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 2:15 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I would like to know more about the two objectives please
2/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
2/1/24, 2:18 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Thank you 
I do understand
2/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
2/1/24, 2:21 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I am delighted to meet you Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi , thank you for you passion into helping us (Edoofians). I hope we have fruitful sessions. Thank you
2/1/24, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
2/1/24, 2:23 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Sounds very interesting
2/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
2/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I understand however since our session time is over, let's wrap it up and look forward to continuing our discussion tomorrow at the same time. I'm excited to delve into more interesting topics and explore new ideas.

And now, here's a little humor to brighten your day: Why did the computer go to therapy? Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😄
2/1/24, 2:29 PM - +27 71 622 8502: 😂very funny 
Thank you so much , we will meet tomorrow
3/1/24, 1:39 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Valentine! 🌞

Let's start the day with a bit of fun and mystery. Here's a riddle for you: 

'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have nobody, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?'
3/1/24, 1:42 PM - +27 71 622 8502: Good afternoon Mentor
3/1/24, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon! How are you doing?
3/1/24, 1:52 PM - +27 71 622 8502: An Echo
3/1/24, 1:52 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I am doing well and I hope you are fine as well
3/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Great!🌟
3/1/24, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
3/1/24, 1:59 PM - +27 71 622 8502: I loved being inspired by Nyasha Grace's work , she is incredible and had me wondering what more can I do. The quote " we do not need to be smarter than that the rest , we need to be more disciplined" was my most favourite because it works together with my morals. But all in all , everything was a hit , I loved the words that did not hit around the bush. And I'm looking forward for another one .
3/1/24, 2:02 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
3/1/24, 2:03 PM - +27 71 622 8502: This sound great Mentor

5/1/24, 2:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

5/1/24, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Valentine, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite!

5/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

As a result, I had to end our session 10 minutes earlier. We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Wishing you a happy weekend!
