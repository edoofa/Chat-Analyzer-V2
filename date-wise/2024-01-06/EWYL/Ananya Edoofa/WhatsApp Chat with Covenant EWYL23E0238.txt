27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Covenant!

I wanted to express my disappointment upon realizing that my last message went unanswered, specifically the question I posed at the end.

I provided you with a holiday to facilitate a focused and stress-free environment for your exams. However, I can't help but feel disheartened that a simple question seems to have been overlooked. I understand the demands of this period, but a basic acknowledgment or response would have sufficed.

It's a small but important detail that will contribute to your success. Is this not important to you?
27/12/23, 4:11 PM - +91 79019 93590: Which message Ma'am?

29/12/23, 4:07 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Covenant!

yes!
29/12/23, 4:10 PM - +91 79019 93590: Evening Ma'am, Ok but I thought had answered  that when I said that

Some agree to pay the admissions fees and I submit the forms here. But I never let an opportunity of enrolling a student pass.I do whatever possible to get as many quality forms possible😊 <This message was edited>
