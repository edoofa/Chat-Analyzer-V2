How was your Christmas celebration🎄?

I am so excited to see how you celebrated it with your loved ones and friends, and yes, what all you receive in your gifts🎁?

We will discuss all this in our session on  *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:00 - 01:30 PM* on the *EWYL Line*.
In our session for today, we will be discussing:
1. Saturday Activity
2. Project updates
(I hope you remember our weekly targets: Either you have to share _5 forms for Community Building projects per week_ OR _1 form for African School Reform project per week_)

This all will be done on the *EWYL Line*, please make sure you follow the daily ritual of saying *'I am a proud edoofian'* every morning.

How are you?
28/12/23, 11:08 AM - Saloni Edoofa: This is awesome, you have done an excellent job!
28/12/23, 11:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
28/12/23, 11:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
28/12/23, 11:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
28/12/23, 11:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
28/12/23, 11:09 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you get a response from the school head about their available time, do let me know so that I can share some valuable resources with you.
28/12/23, 11:11 AM - +263 71 941 0618: I will
29/12/23, 4:25 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,
