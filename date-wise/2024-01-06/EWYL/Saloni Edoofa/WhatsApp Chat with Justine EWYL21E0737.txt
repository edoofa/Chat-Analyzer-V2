23/12/23, 4:27 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Also, let's make the most of the little time we have left and focus on the targets we set earlier for your goals. I'm also curious to hear about your progress in achieving the grant targets. How have you found the journey so far?🤝
23/12/23, 4:34 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you reshare the concern here?
23/12/23, 4:57 PM - +91 73473 53880: Good evening ma'am 

Did you note the form i sent you. The student is saying no-one from edoofa has contacted him yet
24/12/23, 8:46 PM - +91 73473 53880: Merry Christmas 🎄🎄🎄✨✨✨✨
26/12/23, 8:17 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Justine,
How are you?
26/12/23, 8:18 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I have asked the Program Director, but just to reconfirm, may I know when you shared this form with me and where?
26/12/23, 9:15 AM - +91 73473 53880: I shared the form with you on 15 Dec on the EWYL line
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I have asked
27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Justine,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
27/12/23, 4:45 PM - +91 73473 53880: Good evening ma'am 
There isn't any misunderstanding on your part and the grant is more than I could've asked for
28/12/23, 9:51 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Justine,
How are you?
28/12/23, 9:52 AM - +263 78 073 6090: Good afternoon ma'am 
I'm doing well
28/12/23, 9:53 AM - Saloni Edoofa: But I hope you can remember that only a grant will not help you in the long term, I will be sad to see students like you who have so much potential have limited themselves just to that amount.
28/12/23, 9:54 AM - +263 78 073 6090: Apart from the grant and scholarship credits is there more to it ma'am
28/12/23, 9:55 AM - +263 78 073 6090: The credits you say ?
Yes I understand I need to work hard and increase my grants
28/12/23, 9:55 AM - +263 78 073 6090: My scholarship credits I mean ***
28/12/23, 11:05 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, but in the past few months, you performance in projects has been below the average bar. May I know the challenges?
28/12/23, 5:11 PM - +91 73473 53880: I can't say  l have been facing any challenges.  I do reach out to my friends, students who wrote their exams this year at my school 
So I'm not sure if I amnthe one failing to convince them or they don't really want
29/12/23, 3:47 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

I pray for your good health, wealth, and success, and yes,

_*see you next year👋🏼*_
