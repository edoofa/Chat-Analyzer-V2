Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.

4/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
4/1/24, 1:55 PM - +27 74 015 2273: What are the 2 key objectives?
4/1/24, 1:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
4/1/24, 1:57 PM - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
4/1/24, 2:01 PM - +27 74 015 2273: Oh okay I understand
4/1/24, 2:04 PM - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/1/24, 2:06 PM - +27 74 015 2273: I have read it
4/1/24, 2:07 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you grasped from it?
4/1/24, 2:21 PM - +27 74 015 2273: Basically Persistance is showing his gratitude towards you and the EWYL program as he has managed to earn the remaining 1200 dollars for he's tuition fees
4/1/24, 2:30 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Indeed and I am very sure that you will also be able to beat such records and go higher.
4/1/24, 2:30 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
