29/12/23, 9:20 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Shingirai and parents, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Saloni* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.

How are you?
29/12/23, 9:26 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I believe the EWYL Program for Shingirai was supposed to begin on 15th December 2023 but through this time I was waiting for the message from your end which I believe must have been told to you by the Admission Team to share for me to kickstart with the Program. But I had an in-depth discussion with the Admission Team regarding your admission process and indeed I understood that you might be occupied in that so I thought to provide you with the right space to think and make the right decision. I hope if you are ready, we can begin with our session.

I hope you don't have any problem with it.

Your session is from *01:30 - 02:30 PM* - Monday to Friday

Please let me know as soon as possible so that we can resume our sessions.

Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*.

Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
