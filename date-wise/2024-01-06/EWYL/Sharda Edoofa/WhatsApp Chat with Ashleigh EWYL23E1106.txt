I hope you are doing well. My name is Sharda, and you can refer to me as Ms. Sharda. I am here to be the person who helps turn your dream of financing your education through project work into a reality. As your EWYL mentor, I am looking forward to guiding you to make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

As you have already communicated your availability to the admissions officers. I would like to schedule a session with you on January 12, 2023, *from 8:30 am to 9:30 am*. 
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
5/1/24, 4:44 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now given that our session aligns with your preferred day of availability, I am sharing a video introducing myself below. I would greatly appreciate it if you could take a moment to watch the video before our scheduled session on January 12th.
