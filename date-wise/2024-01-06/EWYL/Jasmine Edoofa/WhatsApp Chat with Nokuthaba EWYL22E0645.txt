28/12/23, 1:11 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Nokuthaba,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, *I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity because you have not acknowledged my previous messages*
28/12/23, 1:11 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
28/12/23, 3:34 PM - +91 76961 31143: Good day ma'am.
Please don't worry,I'm still working on my projects..
28/12/23, 3:46 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Dear, I was waiting for you to acknowledge my above messages about Christmas.
28/12/23, 4:38 PM - +91 76961 31143: Ohh..I didn't celebrate the Christmas this year..I had an exam..
28/12/23, 8:29 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I can understand dear but at least you could have wished me. 
Nonetheless, I am happy that you are doing good. 
Goodnight Nokuthaba
