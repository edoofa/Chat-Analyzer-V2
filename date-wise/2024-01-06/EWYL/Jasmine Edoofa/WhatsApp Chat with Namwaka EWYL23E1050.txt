You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.

5/1/24, 1:53 PM - +260 97 0229181: Should I create now
5/1/24, 1:54 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
5/1/24, 1:59 PM - +260 97 0229181: On the basis of apps like Instagram and Facebook, am I supposed to create new accounts leaving the other old accounts   ?
5/1/24, 2:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
5/1/24, 2:01 PM - +260 97 0229181: This is Exciting ma'am.
5/1/24, 2:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Namwaka!
5/1/24, 2:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 2:18 PM - +260 97 0229181: Am done listening to the voice note
5/1/24, 2:18 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
5/1/24, 2:30 PM - +260 97 0229181: Community building is a project under the Edoofa scholarship company that requires young Edoofians to connect with their African relatives or rather people to the Adoofa scholarship organisation and for every student that pays the enrollement fee, that Edoofian will get $20 worth of their scholarship credits and there is also a reward of $5 that the Edoofian gets . So the ideal thing is growing the Edoofa community and one will be rewarded with scholarship credits and one will also acquire good networking skills so as social skills.
5/1/24, 2:35 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That’s awesome- Namwaka, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
5/1/24, 2:42 PM - +260 97 0229181: Yes ma'am.
5/1/24, 2:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project. Are you ready?
5/1/24, 2:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, You have to share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they deserve to be Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

5/1/24, 2:48 PM - +260 97 0229181: ??
5/1/24, 2:50 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, You can start right away.
5/1/24, 2:50 PM - +260 97 0229181: Okay ma'am.
5/1/24, 2:51 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
5/1/24, 2:51 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
5/1/24, 2:51 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 2:53 PM - +260 97 0229181: Sure ma'am.
5/1/24, 2:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
5/1/24, 3:08 PM - +260 97 0229181: I've understood that through the process of community building , I have to create a whats app group  that will lessen my work in communicating to a large number of students about the Edoofa scholarship program . After my early interactions with the students , I must add my mentor to the group so that she can track all the necessary discussions taking place in the group.
5/1/24, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Namwaka, I am impressed with your understanding.
5/1/24, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
5/1/24, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

5/1/24, 3:14 PM - +260 97 0229181: Ma'am but this is talking about Zimbambwe  but am Zambian
5/1/24, 3:17 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, give me a minute
🌟 *EDOOFA Scholar Journey Begins!*
Hey there! I'm [Your Name], thrilled to be selected for the prestigious EDOOFA Scholarship Program in India!

Dreaming of studying abroad? Let me tell you why this is a game-changer. In Zambia, uni fees have skyrocketed to ZKW 21,000 yearly, plus extras! Living costs? Add K1200 per month! 

Public unis? A waiting game, with compromises. Private ones? Double the cost, making dreams distant.
But EDOOFA changes the game! Earn $50-$100 monthly with the Earn While You Learn Program!
I aimed for this scholarship using the 5'S. Dive in, counselors will quiz you using the attached flyer. Complete the Offline Form after acing the 5'S. Good luck!
