Training is a crucial step to ensure that you can derive the maximum benefits from it. Upon completing the training, you will be recognized as a student leader, and you will be responsible for your own application forms.

Does that make sense to you?

▪️ Step 1: Contact and reach out to the prospective students.
▪️ Step 2: Educate them about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
▪️ Step 3: Ask them some questions to see if they qualify.
▪️ Step 4: If they qualify, share the Offline Application form with them.
3/1/24, 7:37 PM - +91 98778 29909: okay
3/1/24, 7:58 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Regarding Step 3, your task is to create five simple questions that you can ask your students. You can refer to the training document for assistance. Is this clear to you?
