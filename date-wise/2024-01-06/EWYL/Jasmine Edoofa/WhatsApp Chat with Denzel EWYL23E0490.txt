I hope this message finds you well. I want to apologize for missing the recent EWYL sessions. I had every intention of attending, but  unfortunately, I wasn't feeling well at the time.I have a backache problem so i was battling it for the past few weeks and now I'm feeling better. I really value the opportunity to participate in these sessions, and I regret not being able to join the group.

I understand the importance of being present and engaged in these sessions, and I assure you that my absence was due to genuine health reasons. I am committed to catching up on any missed material and staying on track with the program.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support. I look forward to contributing fully to the sessions in the future.

Sincerely,
Denzel Mudyodo
