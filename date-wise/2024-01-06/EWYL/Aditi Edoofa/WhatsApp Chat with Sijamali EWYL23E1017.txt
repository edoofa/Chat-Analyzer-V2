27/12/23, 8:38 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - +260 97 6058891: What I learned from the audio is that edoofians take pride in their community building which is the process of establishing and strengthening the next gen's relationship and shared identities among individuals with themselves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate communicate and work towards a common goal the goal of community building is to faster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success
27/12/23, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Subject Combination in Grade 12:-
Current Class ( Grade 11/ Grade 12/ Grade 12 Appeared):

I will be appearing for my Grade 12(Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
27/12/23, 8:53 AM - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
27/12/23, 9:03 AM - +260 97 6058891: So as they apply should they say that the application form is from me or how do they identify me to be the person to help they enroll
27/12/23, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: You simply get this filled out by them and then share it with me here in this group, okay?
27/12/23, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - +260 97 6058891: Alright no problem
27/12/23, 9:09 AM - +260 97 6058891: Alright
27/12/23, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*SIJAMALI/ADITI*
27/12/23, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/12/23, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
27/12/23, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
27/12/23, 9:10 AM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 9:14 AM - +260 97 6058891: Alright clearly understood
27/12/23, 9:15 AM - +260 97 6058891: So when can I begin
27/12/23, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Today after the session. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/12/23, 9:16 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zambia, where tuition fees range from ZKW 16,000 to ZWL 21,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K5000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K1200 per month.

On average, parents in Zambia spend between ZKW 35,000 and ZKW 40,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zambia, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

28/12/23, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
28/12/23, 9:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
29/12/23, 9:11 AM - +260 97 6058891: I choose Monday and Thursday
29/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
29/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
29/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
29/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
29/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
29/12/23, 9:12 AM - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
