5/1/24, 11:59 AM - +263 78 218 5787: Dear Mentor, my name is Delane Marawa, and my EWYL group name is Delane EWYL23E1090. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 05/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"

I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor*.
5/1/24, 4:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
5/1/24, 4:35 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 4:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session *8-Jan-24* from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
