28/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 410 7432: I am Ngwenya Nomzamo , a student selected for the Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. Ofwhich it has been my dream to pursue  my studies  abroad due to the affordability  of fees and employment  opportunity as compared  to Zimbabwe where by the  colleges  and university  fees are expensive  as my parents  also struggled pay my school  fees during my days.And they can't  even raise that money for me to go and start my tertiary  education because  they are also paying for my younger brother  who is grade 6.

I attended  my Secondary  level at Bulu high where l found it enjoyable  to study fashion and fabrics thus where l gained more interest  to work as a fashion designer and also liked being a teacher because because  as a fashion designer  you can desion different  patterns   and sell,work as as a teacher  also l can open and operate my own company  maybe thus l will be aslo helping  my community by  exporting  some other clothes  to be sold  in my country  if its allowed.

Moreover ,since l had finished  my Secondary  level life has been stuck  since l have been applying  for other courses but not been shortlisted  for any.Therefore the fees now at colleges  rates to US $210per term which adds up to US $ 630 per year food exclusive, And to mention internet costs it adds up to $1000 per year.Therefore l find it better to study in India where by the fees are of less costs and has to access  to network the student's  education  is more  valuable. 

I completed  my A Level in 2019 where l did Geography,Economics and Business Studies,I would  like to do Teaching in Fashion and Designing.
My parents have  no professions as  my mother is just at home seated and my father does piece jobs in South Africa.My mother's  highest education  is form 3 in secondary level and my father in grade 7 in Primary level as  their parents  had no money  to pay for their fees.Yes l have got my sister who also do some piece jobs in South Africa to support   her 2 kids who are in Primary   level.Moreover my father is hs been so supportive  to me since l started my primary  as he has been doing  piece jobs to support  us.

It is my desire  to study abroad  and my sister is also willing and promising to be financially  supportive.Since my daddy in now at retirement  stage.And l also had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course,  which offer offers opportunity earnings  between $50 and $100.

Moreso,l attended  my O'Level and A'Level at Bulu High School   which is in Mangwe District  in Matebeleland South  province,thus where  my parents  paid a school fees which tated to US $190 per term to ensure  l had sufficient  internet

29/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 410 7432: Yes l wish to be a fashion designer  as l once  consulted  the other teacher who  also teach it and she told me that its a good career  as you can also open you own company .Since l finishedmy A'Level l looked for work thus l got employed  at the shop  for a year where l was paid $40 and it wasn't even enough because  we also used it at home to buy some other staff like food  since by that time my sister and a brother were not working.

I was then seated at home all the time until l joined DREAMS  club  which is for girls whereby we where asked to choose  courses for ourselves  that was,building,carpentry,and Cutting and designing  thus l had to choose  cutting and designing.We were then told to go in Plumtree  where had our lessons for 6 months from June 2023 untill 20 December  2023.Thus the experience  l have about this career.

However,that wasn't  even enough  for me because we were too many and we didn't  find enough  time to learn more things because  we were going with others  pace.
29/12/23, 12:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, Nomzamo
29/12/23, 12:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nomzamo, I would like to know what specific plans and preparations you and your parents have made for your tertiary education abroad?
29/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 938 6081: As Nomzamo mother's l always wished that maybe one will get money to pay for her in college.We then started  a business of selling airtime with her after finishing her school  but it didn't work as we ended up using it at home since the things were not well.
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Ms. Ireen, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
29/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 410 7432: At this point  Dreams  and Yound Africa  Zimbabwe  combined  ideas thus we ended up leaning  under Young Africa Zimbabwe (YAZ)  and it took us the whole six month  we were paid for our fees

02/01/24, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident for Nomzamo about achieving it
02/01/24, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

02/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 938 6081: Yes l am confident for her
02/01/24, 10:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
02/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 938 6081: No l  didn't do research and l never applied to any of the university

03/01/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!
03/01/24, 2:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: If you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
03/01/24, 4:07 pm - +263 78 410 7432: I see myself having a good name thus  will be promoted by the people  who see and the  customers  around since l will be providing  with good designs  and also selling at an affordable  prices so that l do not lose my customers  and also  advertising my products  so that people won't  assume about what l do thus l will be getting  more  customers that will promote  my profits and interests.Therefore in 5 years time l see myself having my own  company  which will be known  by too many people,teaching  children on how to sew and design  clothes.And being an  edoofian will be more motivating  as l will be gaining more skills and how to also run a business.
03/01/24, 4:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nomzamo, Your vision for the future is truly inspiring, and your commitment to providing quality designs at affordable prices is commendable. Creating a well-known company and sharing your skills by teaching children to sew is a wonderful aspiration.
03/01/24, 4:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
03/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 410 7432: No l am not familiar  with them
03/01/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/01/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 78 410 7432: No l don't  think  its affordable
03/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 78 410 7432: I understand
03/01/24, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
03/01/24, 4:22 pm - +263 78 410 7432: No l am  not aware will be glad if you let me know  how
03/01/24, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
03/01/24, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
03/01/24, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
03/01/24, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
03/01/24, 6:30 pm - +27 73 375 6336: Hi
03/01/24, 6:30 pm - +27 73 375 6336: Can Nomzamo get schoollarchip in Zimbabwe like Bulawayo so
03/01/24, 7:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Ngwenya, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship Program offers student to study abroad that is India.
03/01/24, 7:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 8:02 pm - +27 73 375 6336: Thanks
04/01/24, 8:45 am - +263 78 410 7432: Yes l wkll be benefiting
04/01/24, 9:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*“The only way to have a life is to commit to it like crazy.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
04/01/24, 9:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 9:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
04/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 77 938 6081: Greetings to you all yes we are ready
04/01/24, 9:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well today, Ms. Ireen.
04/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 938 6081: Yes lam doing well  ,
04/01/24, 10:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through this information!
04/01/24, 10:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
04/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 77 938 6081: Earn While you Learn Program  is the best and easy way for the students  ,it will cut some cost frm this poor family ,so Nomzamo is the one comment about it
04/01/24, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

04/01/24, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
04/01/24, 2:47 pm - +263 77 938 6081: Thanks l can see
04/01/24, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you will be able to manage the remaining fees.
04/01/24, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you and your family feels about Nomzamo studying abroad?
04/01/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 9:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
05/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 78 410 7432: Goodmorning,yes we can
05/01/24, 9:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well.
05/01/24, 9:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
05/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 410 7432: Yes,I am
05/01/24, 9:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: I will be waiting for your reply
05/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 410 7432: Yes,we will be discussing  about it ofcourse
I and my family  are feeling  happy  that l am going to study  abroad  where employment opportunities  are high and thus will be also open  minded on how to turn problem  into opportunity .
05/01/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Nomzamo, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/01/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
05/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 410 7432: No l don't  know other requirements
05/01/24, 10:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
05/01/24, 10:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/01/24, 10:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 78 410 7432: I understand
05/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 78 410 7432: Yes l need to know why is it paid ,,and its a non refundable  fee if l am not mistaken
05/01/24, 12:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
05/01/24, 12:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
05/01/24, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
05/01/24, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
05/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 410 7432: Oh alright,then  you mentioned  about refunding back the enrollment  fee when the students don't  meet the requirements for the university then how about the credits earned by the students
05/01/24, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well Nomzamo, Please note that once you are found eligible, your Admission and EWYL Process after your enrollment, and you will start earning scholarship credits worth 50-100$ or more a month <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 1:00 pm - +263 78 410 7432: Alright
05/01/24, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 410 7432: We have discussed  up to stage 5
05/01/24, 1:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, <Nomzamo,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
05/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 78 410 7432: Yes,may you kindly explain for me
05/01/24, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
05/01/24, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
05/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 78 410 7432: Yes l am clear so that means if l am eligible maybe l will start my studies in January 2025
05/01/24, 1:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No, Nomzamo, It is like your intake will be in August 2024, The first part of your registration fee will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025). <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
05/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 410 7432: No,Thank you
05/01/24, 1:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nomzamo, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
05/01/24, 1:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.
