04/01/24, 7:47 am - +263 77 449 9096: Okay thanks.
04/01/24, 9:06 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
04/01/24, 9:17 am - +263 78 576 2872: Yes please my apologies for the late response i
04/01/24, 9:19 am - Harmehak: I understand
04/01/24, 9:19 am - Harmehak: So Providence, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Washington!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
04/01/24, 9:23 am - +263 78 576 2872: Thank you for that question. I got to learn that Edoofa is a scholarship program started with a vision to make the academic life of young Africans less burdening through the services that they provide for us
04/01/24, 9:25 am - +263 78 576 2872: Washington was really helpful. I hard quite a number of questions regarding studying medicine in India. I got to learn that there is need for me to write NEET exams as an admission process.
04/01/24, 9:26 am - +263 78 576 2872: Please pardon me for any late replies, my network is sabotaging me
04/01/24, 9:30 am - Harmehak: I am glad you had a detailed discussion.
04/01/24, 9:30 am - Harmehak: I understand
04/01/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Did Washington happen to share preliminary questions with you?
04/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 576 2872: No he didn't
04/01/24, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Alright please.
04/01/24, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/01/24, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
04/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 576 2872: Okay okay that's insightful
04/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 78 576 2872: Thank you so much for this information. Please allow me to ask this question. Is Edoofa responsible for the school placements in India. Do I get to choose the school.
04/01/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: During the admissions process, you would receive acceptance letter from the universities where your application would have qualified for,

After the same itself, you can discuss everything with your parents and decide which university you wish to opt for, Providence.
04/01/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: I can see you are a student at Dominican Convent, Harare!

Are you aware we are associated with the school?
04/01/24, 10:01 am - +263 78 576 2872: No I was not aware. However I remember there was an information sessions last year and unfortunately I was not able to attend
04/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 78 576 2872: Okay thank you so much
04/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 78 576 2872: An Edoofa information session hosted at school
04/01/24, 10:02 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

We do have students from Dominican Convent as a part of the Edoofa program along with students currently in India!
04/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 576 2872: Interesting🤭. That's the school hall of course. I'm sure I missed out on that session
04/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 78 576 2872: On behalf of Convent, thank you for partnering with our school. We are grateful
04/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words!
04/01/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: I hope you are intrigued to join them this year?
04/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 576 2872: I am. I'm sure I will not miss it because now I'm a junior mistress in the school, so I will be fully informed.
04/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: That's great!
04/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Providence, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
04/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 78 576 2872: I enjoy reading extensively, especially in the medical, financial and computing field. At the moment I am deciding whether I should venture into acturial science or medicine. I have played basketball, squash, karate in high school. My cultural activities were Christian Life Community, Madrigals, Cassa choir, LEO, First Aid and Coding. I held two leadership positions, which were being a prefect, Leo president and Leo secretary at a point. I learnt at St Augustine's High School from form 1 to form four. I then took a gap year program at Star Leadership Academy after my O level, which is an intense leadership program that helps young people to take up roles in leadership and the skills needed in the world. From there I went to study my A level at Dominican Convent. I enjoy volunteering a lot. I have volunteered at Little star, Mountview pre-school, Floweres of hope and many other children's homes and homes of the elderly. At little star I was responsible for teaching grade 1 and 2 pupils. Volunteering at Mount View pre-school was a way of giving back as I learnt there.
04/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 78 576 2872: Both of my parents work, however we are not financially stable. My mother is a bank secretary and my father is a self-employed electrician. I do have 3 siblings. I am the first child, followed by my brother who is about to start his high school journey, followed by my other brother who is in primary and lastly my younger sister who has just been introduced to this world. That is Virtuous, Logic and Pearl respectively.
04/01/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Providence, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to know of your personality traits along with great leadership skills.

I appreciate your parent's efforts to provide well for you and the family!
04/01/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: That's great,

We are associated with St Augustine as well and there are many students enrolled in the program from school along with those currently in India!
04/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 576 2872: Thank you for giving me the platform to express myself.
04/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 576 2872: Oh that's amazing.
04/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
04/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Yes please
04/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Well Providence now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
04/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 576 2872: I think that it is an amazing opportunity. It is life changing to a person you really puts his or her mind on it. For example, Zimbabwe could be life changing for any other foreigner who knows the right strings to pull. What I love about studying abroad is the networking that I will be able to have with other students from different nations and the opportunity to have big talks that can help us to have ideas to change our countries as a way to give back to our countries, not forgetting India that would have made it possible.
04/01/24, 10:56 am - +263 78 576 2872: India is also a great place for someone who wants a hands on experience, which is an area that Zimbabwe is still trying to improve on, which adds on to the reason as to why I would opt to study abroad
04/01/24, 11:01 am - Harmehak: That's well put across and surely well thought off too, Providence.

I can see you have a thorough awareness of your surroundings,

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
04/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 576 2872: What I can say is I do adapt well to new environments, so yes I will manage
04/01/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Providence, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
04/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 576 2872: Yes my family is fully aware of my plans to study abroad. They also have been helping me with the application process including looking for scholarships. Financially, yes they are willing to assist in their capacity.
04/01/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: That's appreciated, Providence!
04/01/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
04/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 576 2872: Well noted. Is it possible to use my AS level results or I will have to wait for the final A-level results that are about to come out
04/01/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: While the finals results are important, currently we would be proceeding ahead on the basis of your previous results.
04/01/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine / Actuarial Sciences?
04/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Okay thank you
04/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 576 2872: I did maths, biology and chemistry
04/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 576 2872: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 576 2872: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 78 576 2872: I would want to study actuarial science mainly because I find mathematics interesting and also I believe that I possess analytical skills.
04/01/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please,

Do ensure active participation!
04/01/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Received
04/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: Providence, I believe you are inclined more towards Actuarial Sciences than Medicine, please?
04/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 576 2872: I also find health sciences to be interesting. Helping people has always been something I wanted especially when it comes to coming up with cures and solutions to the diseases that have been troubling people. I also find l human anatomy to be intriguing and I know that I would enjoy studying it
04/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Noted
04/01/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have a kind heart that wishes to do well!
04/01/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: So which out of the two interests are you more inclined towards, Providence?
04/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Right now im quite inclined towards acturial science. However when I get my results next week, I will be able to make my final conclusion and know exactly where I stand😊.
04/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.

Providence, since you medicine is one your interests, why didn't you pursue Physics in Your A level?

I believe it's a crucial science subject, isn't it?
04/01/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 576 2872: I had no understanding that it was a crucial science. I thought that chemistry and biology were the subjects that mattered
04/01/24, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please
04/01/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
04/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 78 576 2872: True, I should have done my research well. That means I will have to settle for my other option
04/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
04/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: I am providing you with the thorough details so that you can make an informed decision too!

You can go through the same and we shall proceed ahead with our discussion.
04/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 576 2872: So I will have to choose from those options ?
04/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Actuarial science is not offered?
04/01/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: These are the options related to health sector!
04/01/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: We are yet to discuss regarding that.
04/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Okay noted. Thank you
04/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Sure
04/01/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please.

Before, we proceed do you have any queries for me from the discussion so far?
04/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 576 2872: No. I am following
04/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.
04/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me once done
04/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Quite insightful. I understood everything. I am done reading through
04/01/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Can you please share your understanding of the same in your own words, Providence?
04/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 576 2872: What I understood is that I will first have to get my bachelor's degree in Commerce. For me to then become an actuary, I need to write certain exams and pass them, which are quite challenging from my knowledge. After I pass those exams I will have to gain experience by working as a trainee/assistant in an insurance company or so. Networking with other actuaries is important as that will help me to sharpen my skills in that field.
04/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 78 576 2872: What I am not sure about is that do I necessarily have to write those exams after I take my bachelors degree or it is possible to write them even when you are in the process of getting your degree
04/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Also is taking a bachelor's degree in commerce the only pathway to then study acturial science or there is another one
04/01/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: You donot write any exam before your degree.
04/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Okay thank you
04/01/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Here in India, the aspirants pursue Bachelors in Commerce itself to become an Actuarial Scientist!
04/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Noted with thanks
04/01/24, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you have a better clarity,

Actuarial Science is not a bachelor's or master's course, rather it is a certification that a student can pursue alongside pursuing their Degree, so what over here I was briefing you about is that the course of Bachelor in Commerce has several specializations Nokutenda can specialize in Finance and Accounting starting from the second year of their course. 

Along with this degree he can pursue the certification of Actuarial Sciences itself
04/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Oh, thank you for clearing the confusion
04/01/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: As of now would you like to ask anything?
04/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 576 2872: No it's been all clear
04/01/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

Now shall I brief you about Bachelors in Commerce for an even better clarity?
04/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 576 2872: That would be amazing
04/01/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.

04/01/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same itself, Providence?
04/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Yes please
04/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Providence, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 78 576 2872: In the next five years, I would have completed my undergraduate program and I would have taken my actuarial exams as well. With the networks I would have formed during that period, I will be able to find a job be it in India or any other country. I also see myself investing in businesses with the capital I would have raised during that period
04/01/24, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Providence, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 576 2872: I want to study abroad because my country I still developing. I believe that I will be able to form networks and get ideas as to how I can assist in improving the country. When I get things right, I will be able to help my country by making investments, creating employment opportunities for my fellow Zimbabweans. I believe that India also has a hence-on approach when it comes to their educational system. It is that exposure that I seek.
04/01/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Provide, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
04/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 576 2872: I have always admired Indians when it comes to education. I believe that Indians are smart and dedicated people when it comes to their education. They are goal oriented and if I am able to be in that environment I will never go wrong. I have seen how there is so much educational content of solving exam papers on YouTube, including some Apps for student assistant that have been designed by Indian citizens. I believe that it would be good company and this will help me to stay focused on my dreams, hence achieving them
04/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 576 2872: assistance*
04/01/24, 2:45 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your knowledge and kind words, Providence

04/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 78 576 2872: With all this that has been said, this makes it the ideal place to study
04/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Interesting. We sure do learn something new with each passing day
04/01/24, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
04/01/24, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
04/01/24, 5:01 pm - +263 78 576 2872: My deepest apologies, I keep having network problems
04/01/24, 5:01 pm - +263 78 576 2872: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 78 576 2872: No we are not aware. May you kindly guide us
04/01/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: I understand
04/01/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
04/01/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/01/24, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/01/24, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/01/24, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 5:50 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Are these costs per year?
04/01/24, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

Annual amounts before the scholarship
04/01/24, 5:53 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Okay quite clear
04/01/24, 5:53 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Thank you that's understandable
04/01/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Providence, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
04/01/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
04/01/24, 6:13 pm - +263 78 576 2872: I don't think it's a problem, however I think my parents input will also be important
04/01/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
04/01/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: Providence, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
04/01/24, 6:20 pm - +263 78 576 2872: I do agree. The costs of living are very high
04/01/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
04/01/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Providence?
04/01/24, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Providence!
04/01/24, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
04/01/24, 8:01 pm - +263 78 576 2872: It does lessen the burden. I do agree
04/01/24, 8:03 pm - +263 78 576 2872: Good evening. My apologies for all this. I realise that active participation is very important. Thank you for giving me a second chance.
04/01/24, 8:05 pm - +263 78 576 2872: It is just unfortunate that our wifi and network has been acting up today.
04/01/24, 8:05 pm - +263 78 576 2872: I thank you for your dedication today
05/01/24, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
05/01/24, 9:10 am - +263 78 576 2872: Good morning yes we can
05/01/24, 9:11 am - +263 78 576 2872: I hope you are doing well too
05/01/24, 9:11 am - Harmehak: Yes please
05/01/24, 9:12 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/01/24, 9:12 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/01/24, 9:12 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/01/24, 9:12 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/01/24, 9:14 am - +263 78 576 2872: Okay that's interesting. Will these real time live online projects have to do with the degree I will be pursuing or it can be from any field of study
05/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 78 576 2872: This is interesting
05/01/24, 9:15 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

You would be alloted a dedicated mentor who would assist you throughout your journey with your projects related to your field as well as skills required for today's job world.
05/01/24, 9:17 am - +263 78 576 2872: Okay thank you for that. I think we can proceed
05/01/24, 9:18 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 78 576 2872: Well understood
05/01/24, 9:19 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/01/24, 9:22 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 78 576 2872: This is extremely different from other scholarship programs. Mainly because there are a lot of skills earned at the same time earning money to self-sponsor education. Indeed it is a worth-while opportunity
05/01/24, 9:24 am - Harmehak: Indeed he is!
05/01/24, 9:25 am - Harmehak: Very correct,

Did you see Persistence's video?
05/01/24, 9:25 am - +263 78 576 2872: It was still loading, let me do it just now
05/01/24, 9:26 am - Harmehak: Sure please
05/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 78 576 2872: He is goal oriented. I'm sure the parents are more than proud
05/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 78 576 2872: Team work it is
05/01/24, 9:27 am - Harmehak: That's very correct, Providence!
05/01/24, 9:28 am - Harmehak: So did you discuss our yesterday's discussion with your parents too and are they willing to support you, Providence?
05/01/24, 9:29 am - +263 78 576 2872: Yes my parents are willing to support me as always
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Providence, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 78 576 2872: I am ready😊. Let's do this.
05/01/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Providence, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/01/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/01/24, 9:34 am - +263 78 576 2872: Approximately $1500 to $2250
05/01/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/01/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/01/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 9:37 am - +263 78 576 2872: Just to clear the confusion, this $350 is it for applying to 5 schools or. I'm lost there
05/01/24, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 9:39 am - +263 78 576 2872: Oh okay that is very clear thank you and yes it is.
05/01/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
05/01/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 78 576 2872: Is the counseling session the one we are currently going under, or there happens to be another.
05/01/24, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Counseling sessions are free of cost please.

The fee is paid after and if you are found eligible for the program.

And it's paid installments as well.
05/01/24, 9:49 am - +263 78 576 2872: Oh I meant that earlier you mentioned that what we are doing right now is a counseling session of you explaining what Edoofa is. My question is about the 3 phases of the enrollment process with particular attention to phase 1 where you mentioned that my parents and I will have to have a counseling session. So my question is, isn't this the counseling session we are doing already or we will have to sit for another counseling session. If so, will it be face to face or digital like right now
05/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: This is the Counseling session itself.

Let me help you have a better clarity.
05/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 576 2872: Ohhh so this is the phase 1
05/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 576 2872: Yes it is very clear. Thank you so much
05/01/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Now, do you have any queries please?
05/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 576 2872: No I do not have any queries.
05/01/24, 9:53 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/01/24, 9:53 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/01/24, 9:53 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

05/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 78 576 2872: No I am not in touch with them
05/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 78 576 2872: I'm not in touch with his parents
05/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Oh alright
05/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

05/01/24, 10:14 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “06-01-23” at 10:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
