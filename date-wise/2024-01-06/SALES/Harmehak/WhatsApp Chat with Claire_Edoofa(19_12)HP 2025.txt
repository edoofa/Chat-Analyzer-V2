23/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 77 210 3697: Good morning
23/12/23, 10:11 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
23/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 044 7407: Yes I am  very confident
23/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Software Engineering?
23/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 044 7407: English      A
Mathematics   A
Shona Language A
Combined Science  A
Geography A
Physics B
Biology  B
Chemistry C
Pure Mathematics B
Principles of Accounting B
Computer Science   C <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 044 7407: I would like to study software software because I have realized that the world is turning digital. I also have a passion for computing and developing software that would make our lives much more easier
23/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Can you share the same in a picture format?
23/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 044 7407: Right  now im not at home

23/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 044 7407: Yes I have
23/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: That's great,

What all did you learn, Claire?
23/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 044 7407: It's a field that combines computer science, mathematics, and engineering to design, develop, and maintain software systems. It involves a lot of problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork. Software engineers create the programs and systems that power the technology we use every day.
23/12/23, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Very correct, Claire

23/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 044 7407: I see myself as a success in the coming 5 years. I might even be able to start my own company. I'd be able to help my brother pursue his own dreams as well

If I get into the EDOOFA I'd be exposed to the best equipped institutions and I would be able to study without any interruptions due to financial constraints sinces the financial burden would be lessened.
23/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 044 7407: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 044 7407: Here is my O level certificate
23/12/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Claire, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/12/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Received please
23/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 044 7407: It can give me a totally different perspective on the world and my studies. I can learn about other cultures and ways of thinking that I am not exposed to here in Zimbabwe. It can also open up new opportunities for career and personal growth. I also think many people who study abroad end up building global networks and friendships that last a lifetime. 
I also believe that India is a great place to study computer science and software engineering. The country has a thriving tech industry, and there are lots of top-notch universities offering programs in these fields.
23/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Claire, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
23/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 044 7407: India would be such an amazing place to study abroad! It's a country with such a rich history and culture, and it's home to some of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the world. 

I believe the Indian education system is quite different from the systems in many Western countries. For one, it's much more rigorous and competitive. There's a heavy focus on standardized testing, and students work hard to get good grades. The system is also very hierarchical, with students moving up through different levels of education. There's a lot of importance placed on higher education, and many students go on to pursue advanced degrees. One of the main goals of the Indian education system is to prepare students for careers in technology and engineering, in my case is very perfect
23/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have thorough awareness and knowledge, Claire.
23/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

I'd like to be globally recognized for my work just like the Indin origin CEOs above
23/12/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 044 7407: We are not familiar with cost of higher education for an international student
23/12/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
23/12/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 044 7407: Thank you that was informative
23/12/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Claire, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 80- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
23/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 044 7407: That is great news!
The Earn While You Learn program would be great and help with cutting down my costs and not burdening my parents back home
23/12/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
23/12/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Claire, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
23/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 044 7407: Yes, I definitely agree
23/12/23, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Claire?
23/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 044 7407: I now am
23/12/23, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
23/12/23, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/12/23, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/12/23, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

23/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 044 7407: The EWYL program is definitely a program that would help me gain work experience and provides exposure to the digital world
It would also make my tuition affordable <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Claire
23/12/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_ <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 044 7407: The program would be a workable solution to my financial challenges
23/12/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
23/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 210 3697: We are following. This is encouraging
23/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please
23/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 044 7407: Yes I do
23/12/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
23/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 044 7407: Yes I am ready
23/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Claire, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 044 7407: $1500-$2250
23/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Claire, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 044 7407: I really think so!
23/12/23, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/12/23, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/12/23, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 044 7407: Ok I'm following
23/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
23/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
23/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 044 7407: Yes I have
23/12/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
23/12/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 044 7407: Following...
23/12/23, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/12/23, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
23/12/23, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 044 7407: Thank you
We will be in touch with her
23/12/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/12/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/12/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

23/12/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: Dear Claire,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tuesday on “26-12-23” at 10:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision.

26/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
26/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 044 7407: Yes we did manage to get in touch with Mrs Ruth
26/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Did you and your parents have a good discussion with Mrs Ruth, Claire?
26/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 044 7407: Yes we did and she was forthcoming with helpful information about the EDOOFA program and how it has helped her and her daughters
26/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Claire.
26/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

26/12/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 044 7407: I have seen how EDOOFA does not only offer scholarships but interacts with the edoofians 
And I've seen how proud they are to be edoofians
26/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 044 7407: It has boosted our confidence in the program and it's authenticity
26/12/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
26/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 044 7407: 1. Software engineering
2. India
3. $6000-$8000
4.$2000-$3000
5. $350
6. 30 days
7. Yes I am very clear about it
26/12/23, 11:24 am - Harmehak: What's the name of the course that you would be pursuing, Claire?

So now correct your answer 1 and 6 and share the responses again please.
26/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 044 7407: 1. B.Tech Computer Science
2. India
3. $6000-$8000
4.$2000-$3000
5. $350
6. 7 days
7. Yes I am very clear about it
26/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Duly received please,

So are your parents willing to support you for the same, Claire?
26/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 044 7407: Yes they are
26/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I appreciate,

Can they acknowledge the same in the group using a voice note?
26/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 210 3697: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
26/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
26/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
26/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
26/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 210 3697: I understand where you are coming from. We eill thrive to the best of our ability to support Claire in her education endeavors so that she fulfills her dreams and passion
26/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your support.

Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 1st or 2nd January 2023 for $200 and the 1st or 2nd February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 1st or 2nd January 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
26/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 210 3697: Option 1 will be ideal for us
26/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: Duly noted, Mr Musiiwa.

Can you please acknowledge the same using a voice note and if you are financially prepared as well?
26/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 210 3697: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Duly received, Mr Musiiwa.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

29/12/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 210 3697: Thank you Ms Harmerhak for your guidance. God bless you
29/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome Claire, Mrs and Mr Ncube!

I appreciate your kind words please.

Do go through the acceptance letter and inform me once done!
29/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 364 1505: Ok will do so
29/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Sure please
29/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 044 7407: This message was deleted
29/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 044 7407: I have gone through the letter thank you
29/12/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: That's great, Claire
29/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 364 1505: We have gone through the acceptance letter
29/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: That's great please.

So far, do you have any queries for me?
29/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 364 1505: Is the 12.5% transfer fee included in the $350 or do we have to top up
29/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the payment modes, that way you would have a better clarity.
29/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 364 1505: We would appreciate that very much
29/12/23, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
29/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828
