29/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: Well received, Tinotenda, now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd.

29/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 008 4590: Yes
29/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tinotenda, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Makumbe High charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
29/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 008 4590: My introduction goes like

I'm Tinotenda Moyowangu Mapako ...
A girl aged 18 . I'm the first of four children in my family. Right now I'm doing my advanced level. At Makumbe High School we're paying $235usd per term

I wish to study accounting as a degree. Right now I can say my studies are my strength as l get a lot hope in studying and my parents are my weakness nevertheless if anything happen to them means that's my failure. Playing chess on my free time and darts are my hobbies.

Well about family l come from a middle class one and I'm hoping to improve my family standards. My father is a teacher and my mother is a shopkeeper. My father reached tertiary education and my mother reached advanced level. About my siblings one is doing 'o' level , the other one is in form 1 and the last is in third grade .
29/12/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tinotenda, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
29/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Thank you so much
29/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Well Tinotenda now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
29/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yes I do believe so
29/12/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
29/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yes I'm mentally prepared
29/12/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Tinotenda, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
29/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 008 4590: I've already told them and they are supporting me as we're talking right now
29/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate their support, Tinotenda,

It's great to see that they value education for their children.
29/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yeah
29/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
29/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yes I'm very confident about this
29/12/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: That's great
29/12/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Accounting ?
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Well At " o" level I had 4 as 2bs and 3cs and A level I'm doing accounting, business enterprise skills and economics
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Received please,

29/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
29/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 008 4590: I have researched that India has a very diverse and complex education system, with different types of schools, colleges, and universities. The country has been making significant investments in education in recent years, and there are now many excellent higher education institutions in India. I think studying in India could be a great option for anyone who wants to learn about Indian culture, language, and history, and who wants to experience the country's vibrant and diverse culture firsthand. The cost of living in India is also relatively low, making it a more affordable option for international students.
29/12/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you have awareness and knowledge about India, Tinotenda!
29/12/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

29/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Wow I see that India has got a lot to do with business and I'm likely showing more interest in your country and I'm honoured to know that the cost of education is lower there
29/12/23, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Tinotenda 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
29/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Probably not
29/12/23, 2:31 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
29/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 008 4590: I can see that it's cheaper than what I thought
29/12/23, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Tinotenda, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
29/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 008 4590: It's a good suggestion and I hoping to score well so that I will be eligible for your 90-100% scholarship
29/12/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: That's the spirit
29/12/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: Tinotenda, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
29/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yes I agree ,it's true
29/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in an even better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tinotenda?
29/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yeah,I have seen that
29/12/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
29/12/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/12/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
29/12/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

29/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 008 4590: I'm so honoured and now I believe I can also do it
29/12/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
29/12/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Okay l genuinely understand
29/12/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 008 4590: I've gone through the pictures that you have send and I that realized that the greater l became  part of the eligible Edoofa program the better I'll earn
29/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yes you're very different l can see that
29/12/23, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
29/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yes I'm ready
29/12/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: Tinotenda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
29/12/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 008 4590: 1500_2250
29/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 008 4590: USD
29/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/12/23, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: You see Tinotenda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yes ,I do
29/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
29/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Probably in that case I have to talk to my parents
29/12/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: It's paid after you are found eligible and I shall provide you resources for a proper discussion too!
29/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yes please do
29/12/23, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
29/12/23, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
29/12/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
29/12/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
29/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Ok I have understood now
29/12/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
29/12/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Ok I get it
29/12/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
29/12/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
29/12/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Ok so what am I suppose to say to her
29/12/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: You can just communicate regarding the scholarship and connect your parents with Mrs Ruth too.
29/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Wow so great I can see they are fluently speaking English
29/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Okay
29/12/23, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
29/12/23, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Tinotenda
29/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 008 4590: So as for the first stage are we done
29/12/23, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
29/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
29/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
29/12/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

02/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate,

What all did you discuss Tinotenda and so far, do you have any queries for me?

02/01/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow our discussion regarding the Earn While You Learn Program please?
02/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Yes we did but it's a challenge to my parents so they want to be reassured on this one

02/01/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: You don't do any jobs please.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/01/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: You do projects and after completing the same you earn credits.
02/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 597 5559: I am the parent for Tinotenda Mapako I am following the programme and I am fully understood ur conversation and hope I am going to help him to fully understand
02/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Ok now we have clearly understood
02/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Hello Mr Mapako.

It's great to have you following the discussion please.
02/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything else?
02/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 77 597 5559: I am satisfied with the discussion

02/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 597 5559: Thank u
02/01/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
02/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 597 5559: Will discuss more with her today
02/01/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

02/01/24, 9:50 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please
02/01/24, 9:51 pm - +263 78 008 4590: Good night
03/01/24, 8:01 am - +263 77 597 5559: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 8:07 am - Harmehak: Good morning Mr Mapako!
03/01/24, 8:08 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
03/01/24, 8:08 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
03/01/24, 8:08 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
03/01/24, 8:08 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 9:08 am - +263 77 597 5559: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 9:09 am - Harmehak: Your support is thoroughly appreciated, Mr Mapako!

Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 9th or 10th January 2023 for $200 and the  9th or 10th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 9th or 10th January 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
03/01/24, 9:22 am - +263 77 597 5559: I am committed to pay but the challenge are your dates , they are colliding with opening days for her upper sixth which need fees for Tinotenda and other siblings
03/01/24, 9:23 am - Harmehak: I can understand what you are sharing please,

Let me discuss with the academic board regarding the same and get back to you, Mr Mapako.
03/01/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 597 5559: Noted with thanks
03/01/24, 9:26 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
03/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: I did discuss about Tinotenda's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tinotenda's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
03/01/24, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same Mr Mapako?
03/01/24, 6:07 pm - +263 77 597 5559: Noted with thanks
