From a young age, I've always been interested in the complex interplay between the law and society.

Even without working in a law office, I've learned a lot about the legal system and its impact on people's lives through my studies and extracurricular activities. I believe that my drive to learn and my passion for justice make me a good fit for a career in law, even though I don't have.Here's how I could add that to the answer...In addition to my academic studies, I've also participated in a mock trial competition in high school. This experience gave me a firsthand look at what it's like to argue a case in court and advocate for a cause. I gained valuable experience in presenting arguments, questioning witnesses, and researching legal issues. This experience further solidified my desire to pursue a career in the legal field.
21/12/23, 2:23 pm - Kunal: That is fine, Kimberly

Your comprehensive explanation of your passion for law and your experiences, especially the participation in a high school mock trial competition, is impressive. It's evident that you've actively sought opportunities to engage with the legal system, even without direct professional experience.

21/12/23, 2:29 pm - Kunal: That is alright
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
21/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 058 1069: I am very much confident about achieving them
21/12/23, 2:32 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion towards law, you are eligible to pursue

21/12/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Degrees are actually globally recognized?
21/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 058 1069: There are several places in India that would be ideal for studying law and building a successful career. For example, Delhi is home to some of the best law schools in the country, such as the National Law School of India University and the University of Delhi Faculty of Law. Mumbai is another great option, as it's a major business hub and is home to several prominent law firms. Additionally, Chennai is known for its vibrant legal community and strong ties to the international legal world. Each of these cities offers a unique environment for studying and working on my career path
21/12/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 058 1069: To answer the second question in order to achieve my law career aspirations after studying in India, I plan to take advantage of the many opportunities available. I will seek out internships and clerkships at law firms and legal organizations in India, and I will attend networking events and conferences to connect with other professionals in the legal field. Additionally, I will seek out opportunities to volunteer with legal aid organizations and pro bono projects, which will allow me to gain valuable experience and give back to the community. Finally, I will work to develop my language skills and cultural understanding, so that I can be an effective advocate for my clients. By taking these steps, I believe I can achieve my career aspirations .

21/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Oky sure thank you
22/12/23, 9:40 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
I hope you are having a wonderful day

Shall we proceed with the session?
22/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 058 1069: Yes sure
22/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 058 1069: Are you there
22/12/23, 11:03 am - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
22/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 058 1069: I can give you a range of costs, based on the information I've gathered. For tuition, the average cost for international students at leading universities in India is between $5,000 and $10,000 per year. For living expenses, the average cost for international students in cities like Delhi and Bangalore is between $3,000 and $6,000 per year. That's what l only gathered during the course of the time l discovered edoofa existed .l have actually been meaning to ask you as well.
22/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 058 1069: Hello
22/12/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: I see you have researched well
22/12/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/12/23, 11:19 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 058 1069: Ohhhky
22/12/23, 11:22 am - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
22/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 058 1069: I understand
22/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 058 1069: If l get the edoofa scholarship will the income l earn from Earn while you learn program be mine
22/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 058 1069: Also .. Given the cost savings that Edoofa can provide, are there any trade-offs in terms of quality or access to resources for students who choose this option?.
22/12/23, 11:33 am - Kunal: Let me help you understand more on

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/12/23, 11:33 am - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/12/23, 11:33 am - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
22/12/23, 11:33 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

22/12/23, 11:33 am - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs

TIA Organics
22/12/23, 11:33 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 11:33 am - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
22/12/23, 11:33 am - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
22/12/23, 11:46 am - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 12:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

22/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Hello good afternoon
22/12/23, 1:05 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
22/12/23, 1:05 pm - Kunal: Please address this
22/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Yes ! l think this will be benefiting me because   The Earn While You Learn Program offers a unique opportunity for students to gain real-world experience while they pursue their education. By working on projects that are relevant to their field of study, students gain a deeper understanding of the concepts they are learning in class and a greater appreciation for the real-world applications of their knowledge. Additionally, they develop important soft skills such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are essential for success in any career.

Overall, the program benefits students by preparing them for the modern workplace and helping them stand out.This is something one has to commend about edoofa
22/12/23, 1:27 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
22/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Oky l have understood
22/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
22/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
22/12/23, 1:38 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
22/12/23, 1:38 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most

23/12/23, 9:49 am - Kunal: Please address this
23/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 058 1069: Of the four points ,the Earn While You Learn program seems to be the most compelling.With the Earn While You Learn program, Edoofa is truly redefining the higher education experience. Unlike traditional universities, which often leave students with little more than a degree and a mountain of debt, Edoofa offers students the chance to gain hands-on experience while earning money. This program provides a number of benefits, including the opportunity to develop practical skills, build a professional network, and gain financial independence. It also allows students to put their classroom knowledge to the test in the real world, gaining confidence and a competitive edge in the job market. With Edoofa, students don't just learn  they earn.
23/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 058 1069: Hello

23/12/23, 10:32 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 058 1069: Oky
23/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 058 1069: My father
23/12/23, 10:34 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
23/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 058 1069: I would have wanted them to answer for themselves but from what l have noted 
As parents ,  they have  their fears and concerns that they have about their child studying abroad. It can be hard to trust that your child will be safe and happy in a new and unfamiliar place. But they also know that  studying abroad can be an amazing and life-changing experience for me . They have  noted  many benefits to living and learning in a new country, including cultural immersion, independence, and personal growth. I know it's scary for them to let go but they are ready to take the risk for me to grow and develop.
23/12/23, 10:54 am - Kunal: Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of your child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

23/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Hello
23/12/23, 12:35 pm - Kunal: Greetings everyone
Shall we proceed?
23/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Yea
23/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Yes
23/12/23, 12:42 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
23/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 058 1069: These are the ones l know :
- Their official high school transcript
- A letter of recommendation from a teacher or counselor
- A personal statement or essay
- Their standardized test scores (such as the SAT or ACT)
- Proof of English proficiency (such as a TOEFL or IELTS score)
- A copy of their passport
- Proof of financial support (such as bank statements or letters from a sponsor)
- A completed application form

However the specific requirements may vary depending on the university and country.
23/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Okay
23/12/23, 1:20 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
23/12/23, 1:20 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
23/12/23, 1:20 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Oky
23/12/23, 1:22 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/12/23, 1:22 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
23/12/23, 1:22 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Okay
23/12/23, 1:29 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 058 1069: 4
23/12/23, 1:34 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
23/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Yes you can go ahead
23/12/23, 1:59 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
23/12/23, 1:59 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
23/12/23, 2:00 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.

29/12/23, 12:17 pm - Austin: No please, international students aren't permitted to do part-time jobs during their studies in India in order to fully focus on education and personal development.

29/12/23, 12:17 pm - Austin: So may I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please

29/12/23, 1:45 pm - Austin: Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 
This cost can be further reduced by you through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
29/12/23, 1:45 pm - Austin: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$750) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family
29/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 058 1069: Oky l have understood

04/01/24, 7:56 pm - Austin: You are most welcome,Kimberly, we are really glad that you qualified for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. We look forward to you as a proud Edoofian fulfilling your career goals through this opportunity.
04/01/24, 7:58 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, have you gone through the Acceptance Letter?
04/01/24, 7:58 pm - +263 78 389 3786: Not yet on it now
04/01/24, 8:01 pm - Austin: Surre, let me know once you are done
04/01/24, 8:02 pm - +263 77 662 7580: Yes l have managed to go through the application letter
04/01/24, 8:07 pm - +263 78 389 3786: Done
04/01/24, 8:13 pm - Austin: Great, do you have any questions for me?
04/01/24, 8:15 pm - +263 78 389 3786: Yes my question is 
That other fbc account you gave us is that the procedure isnt the money supposed to come through the school  account despite doesnt the scholarship cover everything and the student coming in when processing her visa and all other part payment of tution like you said when she is already there
04/01/24, 8:21 pm - +263 77 662 7580: We also want to meet with Mr Charles Jerera to make the payments in person .Is this possible? <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 8:23 pm - +263 78 389 3786: Exactly we cant just send money to someone we dont even know
04/01/24, 8:29 pm - +263 77 662 7580: Hello...Mr Austin are we still connected?
04/01/24, 8:29 pm - Austin: That is a genuine concern @263783893786 and as you can see, the mode 1 is the direct transaction to our organization's account and the mode 2 is the payment through our associate in Zimbabwe. Inorder to do a direct international transaction from Zimbabwe, you need to have a foreign currency account
04/01/24, 8:30 pm - Austin: The transfer charges for a direct international transaction would be $50-$100 per transaction.
04/01/24, 8:31 pm - Austin: Not every parent in Zimbabwe has a foreign currency account in the first place and can afford to pay up to $100 just as transfer charges, depending on the bank
04/01/24, 8:32 pm - Austin: This is the reason, you have the mode 2 to pay through our associate in Zimbabwe, and the transfer charge is 12.5%. But @263783893786, please note that it is not mandatory to use this mode and you can opt for mode 1 itself after discussing it with your bank. May I know, do you have a Foreign Currency Account?
