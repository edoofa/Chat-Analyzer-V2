05/01/24, 9:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.
After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.*

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc!

05/01/24, 11:37 am - +260 96 8775080: I was at Dominican convent secondary school. 
In grade 9,I passed my exams with  509, I was accepted back to my previous school and was put in a pure science class.
I have written my grade 12 final exams and  l am waiting for my results. 
I was a member of badminton and debate club. I was the president of my debate club.
I am a very good leader,  I love learning new skills to develop myself and I enjoy meeting new people. 
My  parents both went to school but ended in grade 12.
I come from a broken family, my father is unemployed and my mother is mentally sick. I was taken in by my widowed aunt  with four daughters who raised me.
Therefore I do not want to end up like my parents.  I want to work hard and do better. Because I know with good education there are a lot of opportunities for employment. Both formal and informal.
05/01/24, 11:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am truly sorry to hear about your situation, Antoinette. I hope God will provide you with the strength to fight through adversity.

Your enthusiasm for learning new skills and personal development is commendable. Your ability to enjoy meeting new people reflects a positive and open-minded approach! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!

05/01/24, 1:01 pm - +260 97 7340902: Am 52 years old. A mother of two girls. Im an accountant by profession and a holder of a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting as well as a Diploma in Financial Administration.
Apart from my daughter's I have raised 3 other daughters namely Antoinette here and two other girls for my sister. I have seen that education is a great equalizer as am the bread winner in my family. I promised myself to support my siblings children when I saw they could not. I can proudly say that as at today all the girls have completed grade 12. This is how I have supported Antoinette so that she gains economic independence for her future wellbeing.
05/01/24, 1:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your commitment to education and your role as a dedicated accountant reflect a commendable blend of professional excellence and personal generosity. Holding a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting and a Diploma in Financial Administration is a testament to your academic prowess and commitment to mastering the intricacies of your field. Your decision to extend your support beyond your immediate family, fostering the education of your sister's children and others, highlights your understanding of the transformative power of education as a great equalizer. Your efforts as the breadwinner in your family demonstrate not only financial responsibility but also a deep sense of care and dedication to the well-being and future success of those under your guidance, Mrs. Maureen!
05/01/24, 1:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Antoinette's education abroad?
05/01/24, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7340902: Thank you so much. I have great interest in the welfare of Antoinette as evidenced by my support from pre school til now.
