05/01/24, 11:10 am - Kunal: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

My brother is doing mining whilst my other ones are still in primary and secondary school. My family is from Mberengwa, Zimbabwe and now is staying in Shurugwi, Zimbabwe. My father is a miner and mother is a salesperson. I completed my Upper six last year and I was doing Arts which are History, Heritage Studies and Literature and came out with 13 points. I want to study law. My parents both attended school to ordinary level. They have been supporting my education and they will  be supporting me abroad. My school was Shurugwi 2 High School in Midlands and we were paying 70USD per term
05/01/24, 12:12 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear and learn more about you. I am really happy that you expressed yourself genuinely.
So, may I know what fascinated you about pursuing a course and career in law?
05/01/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 676 7555: What fascinated me about pursuing a course and career in law is the fact that studying law means having knowledge on how the cogs of the Society turns. It also helps me to get a better understanding on how to play the game of Life and I can also know when my rights are infringed upon. Studying law can also help with the ability to think critically ,, to negotiate and to also communicate efficiently which is also essential in business field
