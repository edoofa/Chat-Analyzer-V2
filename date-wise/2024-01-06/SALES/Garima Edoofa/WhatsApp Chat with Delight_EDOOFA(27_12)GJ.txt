04/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 729 9501: Sure! It's great that you're asking about how my experience abroad can benefit my home country. I would use my time studying abroad to learn as much as possible about different approaches to education and how they compare to the education system in my home country. I would also learn about the strengths and weaknesses of the education system in my home country, and use my knowledge and experience to help make improvements where possible. I believe that the more diverse perspectives we can bring to the education system, the better it will be for everyone involved.
04/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Delight, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
04/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 729 9501: That's a really insightful point! I agree that in order to have a positive impact on the education system in my home country, I would need to be in a position of influence and have the support of others. Studying abroad can certainly help me gain the knowledge and experience I need to be an effective leader, but you're right that having a supportive environment is also important. I would need to be able to return home and implement the changes I've learned about in a way that is accepted and supported by the people around me
04/01/24, 4:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
