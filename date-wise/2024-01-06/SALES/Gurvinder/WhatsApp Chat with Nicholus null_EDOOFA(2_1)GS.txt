02/01/24, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Nicholus, Mr and Mrs Micklas!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
02/01/24, 8:03 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
03/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
03/01/24, 10:58 am - +260 97 7998565: Good morning sir kindly update us on the issue at hand we are a bit behind
03/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs Charity,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
03/01/24, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
03/01/24, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

05/01/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
