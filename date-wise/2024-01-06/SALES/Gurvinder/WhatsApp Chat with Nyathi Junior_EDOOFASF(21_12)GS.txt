I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
21/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Good afternoon Mr Gurvinder Singh
21/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 945 8984: The prior understanding I have about the Edoofa Scholarship Programm is that, it has committed to delivering  quality education and employebility outcomes
21/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Nyathi,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
21/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
21/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you more about the program?
21/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes its ok
21/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Thanks
21/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Nice to hear that Mr Gurvinder
21/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
21/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
21/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
21/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes I need to continue with my studies further but I have a single parent  so may u kindly assist me to reduce financial burden
21/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Nyathi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
21/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes I think soo

27/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 945 8984: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
27/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

27/12/23, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Nyathi I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
27/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Furthermore , after 5 years of completion of this carrier I see my self as a well educated guy who will assist other Zimbabwean Citizens who are willing to study the same course
27/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes I'm willing Mr Gurvinder I'm already started to be a hard work er in order for me to persue maximum points in my Alevel
27/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
27/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 945 8984: I want to study abroad and not in my country because I want to persue this course with a highly standard grade in order for me to get high chances to get employed by other countries
27/12/23, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?

27/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Nyathi, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
27/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 945 8984: I agree Mr Gurvinder
27/12/23, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
27/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes
27/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

29/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 945 8984: Good morning everyone, sorry for being absent yesterday there was no network
29/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
29/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
29/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Noted
29/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes there are familiar but theres a little bit challenge in terms of firnance
29/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 945 8984: OK understood Mr Gurvinder
29/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
29/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Ok
29/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Nyathi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 945 8984: I understand mr Gurvinder
29/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Thank you very much
29/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

29/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes this will benefit me because I'm seeing that if I complete my course I will be able to get employment in any field
29/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Nyathi, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 945 8984: OK Mr Gurvinder thats awesome
29/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
29/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes its clear Mr Gurvinder
29/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Nyathi, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
29/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes Mr Gurvinder I will make them understand because there are wishing to support me for my higher education
29/12/23, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
29/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 945 8984: We have discussed so far and they wish but the challenge is that they will not afford to pay fee .
29/12/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Please, they have to worry about the fees only in August 2025, right? And assuming you could earn $100 every month through EWYL program, you can earn upto $1800 until the University starts, all together you would have earned the whole year's tuition fee even before you start going to the University.
29/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 945 8984: OK Mr Gurvinder I will make them understand thank you for the given information
29/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/12/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes I'm ready
29/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Nyathi as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 945 8984: $1500-$2250
29/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Nyathi, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Noted
29/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Understood
29/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 945 8984: I think so
29/12/23, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/12/23, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Nyathi basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
29/12/23, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
29/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Noted mr Gurvinder
29/12/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
29/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
29/12/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes I'm familiar
30/12/23, 6:38 am - +263 78 945 8984: Yes Mr Gurvinder but network connection is low
30/12/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 945 8984: Good morning everyone
02/01/24, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all."*

*Happy New Year to you and your family.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
02/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Good morning , everyone happy newyear too
02/01/24, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Nyathi, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
02/01/24, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
02/01/24, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
02/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Yes I understand
02/01/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
02/01/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
02/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
02/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 945 8984: Understood Mr Gurvinder I have no questions
02/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
02/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/01/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Topic:what is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?

In the context of Rwanda, the term genocide refers to the mass killing of Tutsis and moderate Hutus by the Hutu majority government and Hutu militias in 1994.The violence was sparked by decades of ethnic tensions between the Hutus and Tutsis , but the government led killings were organised and systematic .Its estimated that up to one million people were killed during the genocide , and many more were displaced or traumatized .The genocide ended when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) , a Tutsi led rebel group , took control of the country and established a new government.

The genocide in Rwanda was more effective and the conditions in Rwanda after the mass killings stopped .Families were decimated , and the mass killings caused physical and psychological damage to survivors .The genocide devastated the country , destroying homes and communities .Up to 2 million people , including many Hutu perpetrators , fled the country .

The Rwanda's economy after the civil war and genocide was destroyed .The 1994 genocide destroyed Rwanda's fragile economic base, severly impoverished the population , particularly women , and eroded the country's ability to attract private and external investment .

However, Rwanda has made significant progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy .Today Rwandwa is a beautiful country with pleasant climate and reverse landscapes, including valcanoes, mountains, rainforests, and lakes.The cost of living in Rwanda is relatively low compare to other African countries , and the local currency, the Rwandan Franc, is stable.

In conclusion , the life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide became well changed and well developed in terms of economy and its currency due to the fact that Rwanda made a significant progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy

My inspirational story

Once upon a time , a man found a butterfly that was starting to hatch from its cocoon .He sat down and watched the butterfly for hours as it struggled to force itself through a tiny hole .Then , it suddenly stopped making progress and looked like it was stuck .Therefore, the man decided to help the butterfly out.

He carefully approached the hole and , with a gentle touch , he scooped up the butterfly and placed it on a nearby leaf .The butterfly was so grateful to be free once again , and it fluttered its wings in thanks.

A man smiled and said, "You are welcome, little one.I am here to help those in need , just as I am sure you are here to help the world with your beauty and grace.

The butterfly flew off , and a man continued on his way .But he never forgot the lesson he learned that day , that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a big difference.
