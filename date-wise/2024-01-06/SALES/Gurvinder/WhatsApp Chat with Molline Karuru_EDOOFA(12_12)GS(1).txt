12/12/23, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Molline, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Resistance, is that correct?

12/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 698 8605: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 698 8605: Providing Higher education quality and enabling a student to be a critical thinker and have responcsebility skills
12/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me also brief you about the program.
12/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: But first I want to ask you that you reply through text only.
12/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 698 8605: Ohhhhh okay sorry
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Yes it is
12/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Molline, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Definitely l think so
12/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Now Molline, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 910 0332: Agreed
12/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Okay Noted
12/12/23, 6:27 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
12/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 698 8605: I am really sorry for the late response  due to some network problems
13/12/23, 7:43 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 698 8605: My name is Molline Karuru and aged 19 l am a Zimbabwean and live in Harare l am a former student at FD Roosevelt Girls High at which l was currently doing my A level studies and now waiting for my final results.There l was the senior prefect and led various formal clubs as the president which includes ZUNA ,debate and public speaking which have been a driving force in which l would love to indulge in the faculty of law.Besides being in these formal clubs l was and also a volleyball player.The school is located in Harare Eastlea and my per-term A level fees amounted to USD 300.My mom is an accountant and has attained a Bachelor in Business Management and Accounting she is the one who takes care and is responsible for my education fees.My father is decreased and l am the only child my mother has.Be that as it may,l am a student who is highly devoted to her education and career and takes full responsibility of that.
13/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Once again I am sorry for the late replies
13/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: I am so sorry to hear about your father.
13/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 698 8605: It's fine
13/12/23, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
13/12/23, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?

13/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Thank you
13/12/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Law, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
13/12/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Well l feel like a lot of innocent souls ended up in jail not because they were guilty enough or couldn't defend themselves but they lacked people who could have defended them better in the eyes of law only because they had insufficient funds they couldn't get the lawyers they wanted .So if the current system is failing to provide and bring Justice to the people and us having millions of people who are eager and would love to change that and me being one of them then I must say what is needed is an opportunity for that change to take place
13/12/23, 5:03 pm - Gurvinder: Molline, your motivation to pursue Law is truly admirable. Your insight into the shortcomings of the legal system regarding access to justice due to financial limitations is profound. Your desire to be a part of a change that ensures everyone has fair and adequate legal representation speaks volumes about your commitment to justice and equality. Your aspiration to bridge this gap and empower those who lack resources to seek rightful justice is commendable. Your passion for creating a more equitable legal system is a testament to your dedication and vision for a better society.
13/12/23, 5:03 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
13/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 698 8605: No
13/12/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 698 8605: And that's why l am inspired to be the  first
13/12/23, 5:10 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
13/12/23, 5:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?

14/12/23, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
14/12/23, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

14/12/23, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

16/12/23, 8:30 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
18/12/23, 8:21 am - +263 78 698 8605: Morning how are you
18/12/23, 8:21 am - +263 78 698 8605: Yes yes
18/12/23, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
18/12/23, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 698 8605: So five years from now l am seeing myself being ready to be  one of the effective and well known lawyers who would use the opportunity wisely to change many lives bridging the gap between the poor and the rich interms of getting lawyers of their choice inorder to attain the justice they deserve.So sometimes rather than waiting for a change to take place you have to be the change yourself so in five years from now l would have acted as a change myself not waiting upon the active system or the government as they say if you want a miracle be the miracle yourself.And as for Edoofa program it is going to enable me to receive higher quality education which is of higher standard in making me a better lawyer by providing me with a fifty percent scholarship offer working hand in hand with my guardian for me to be a responsible and goal oriented student.
18/12/23, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Molline I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
18/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Definitely l am ready to give my all
18/12/23, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 698 8605: I guess due to the economy instability in my country there is a high rise of sky rocketing of prices and fees and also strikes are taking place in both lecturers and students
18/12/23, 4:56 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
18/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 698 8605: As l have mentioned before if you sometimes wait for a change it might not take place but if you yourself become the change then a problem is solved so the education in my country is not poor or bad but it is filled with the negativity in both teachers and learners when it comes to putting their best efforts in education so if l get this opportunity l will be the change in transforming the minds of both students and teachers as l would have been exposed to other ways and skills in which other nations tackle their problems and handling the education sector
18/12/23, 5:23 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Molline, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
18/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 698 8605: I do agree
18/12/23, 5:29 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
18/12/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Yes yes
18/12/23, 5:31 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Gurvinder: So now Molline, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
18/12/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 698 8605: No.... so far so good
18/12/23, 5:39 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
18/12/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Not really
18/12/23, 5:56 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
18/12/23, 5:56 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 5:56 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 5:56 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 5:57 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Okay okay Understood
18/12/23, 6:27 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Yes sure
18/12/23, 6:34 pm - Gurvinder: Molline, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/12/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Okay alright
18/12/23, 6:55 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
18/12/23, 6:55 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
18/12/23, 6:55 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

18/12/23, 6:55 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
18/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Yes for sure
18/12/23, 6:59 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Molline, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 7:00 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Okay noted
18/12/23, 7:02 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/12/23, 7:02 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
18/12/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Okay okay
18/12/23, 7:26 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Thank you l am inspired
19/12/23, 8:33 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
19/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Good morning how are you
19/12/23, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Molline, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
19/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Yes yes
19/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
19/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 698 8605: Yes l have
19/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/12/23, 8:32 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
20/12/23, 8:39 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
20/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 698 8605: Morning
20/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 698 8605: Yes sure
20/12/23, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: Are you ready?
20/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 698 8605: Yes
20/12/23, 9:43 am - Gurvinder: Molline, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 698 8605: Ohhhhh okay
20/12/23, 9:45 am - Gurvinder: Please answer the exact figure.
20/12/23, 9:45 am - +263 78 698 8605: 1500-1650
20/12/23, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Molline, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/12/23, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 698 8605: Okay okay
20/12/23, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 698 8605: Yes yes
20/12/23, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Molline basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
20/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
20/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 698 8605: Okay thank you
20/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 698 8605: Okay okay
20/12/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
20/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 698 8605: No enlighten me
20/12/23, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Alright Molline, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
20/12/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 698 8605: Yes l do
20/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
20/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
20/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
20/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 698 8605: No l have understood
20/12/23, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
20/12/23, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
20/12/23, 11:35 am - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

20/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 698 8605: Okay noted
21/12/23, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: Hello @263786988605 @263779100332 .

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
21/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 910 0332: Absolutely!
21/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 698 8605: Yes
21/12/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
21/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 910 0332: Yes how much should we budget for starting in 2024
21/12/23, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Please, right now you only have to worry about the enrollment fee, as the session starts in August, and until then if we assume that Molline's fee is $2200 per year, and through EWYL program she earns $100 per month, she would have collected $700 even before she starts going to the University.
21/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 910 0332: That’s amazing. So what are my next steps as the guardian
21/12/23, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: So @263779100332 , before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @263786988605 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
21/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 910 0332: 1. She wants to study for her Law degree
21/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 910 0332: 2. India
21/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 910 0332: 3.  6000-8000 USD
21/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 910 0332: 4. 2000-3000 USD
21/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 910 0332: 5. 350 usd

21/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 910 0332: 6. Earn while you learn allows Molline to earn credits in order to reduce her fees and expenses so for examples $2000 fees and she gets 500 credits worth it means it reduces the amount to 1500

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
