22/11/23, 11:15 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 274 4769: Yes is it
22/11/23, 11:42 am - Tushti: Alright so Carlos, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 3:11 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 3:12 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:12 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 3:12 pm - Tushti: In simple words Carlos, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.* <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 3:12 pm - Tushti: Kindly ask your parent to come online and share their understanding of the costs in the form of a voice note now <This message was edited>

18/12/23, 3:31 pm - Tushti: May I know how long this will take?

18/12/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 804 7815: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 9:40 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
19/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Afternoon
How do you do?
19/12/23, 1:53 pm - Tushti: In answer to your parent's question, we shall be sending the application to multiple universities
19/12/23, 1:53 pm - Tushti: Now let me brief you about the EWYL Program
19/12/23, 1:53 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
19/12/23, 1:53 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/12/23, 1:53 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/12/23, 1:54 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
19/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 274 4769: I will go through it now
The network had been hectic lately
Sorry for that
19/12/23, 3:24 pm - Tushti: Kindly let me know if you have any questions
19/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Okay that will be great
19/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Okay 
By partaking many projects I. The EWYL program
Does it mean that you could also be interrupting your studies in any way?
19/12/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Is there limit to projects a student can take in EWYL
19/12/23, 3:31 pm - Tushti: No, we ensure that the projects do not hinder studies
19/12/23, 3:31 pm - Tushti: The sky is the limit!
19/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Okay thanks
19/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Okay 
Nice to know
19/12/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
19/12/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: Carlos, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Between $1500- $2250
19/12/23, 3:47 pm - Tushti: Exactly Carlos, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/12/23, 3:47 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 3:47 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/12/23, 3:48 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 274 4769: The network connection here is kinda bad
So let me check with mom if she can come online
19/12/23, 3:56 pm - Tushti: Do answer
19/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 274 4769: The revolutionary is quite fair and helpful 
That I guarantee
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 274 4769: So does this mean that I should be a passport holder
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: Absolutely, how would you travel to India without a passport, dear?
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: Carlos, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Tushti: Are you able to understand?
19/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Okay
I was just trying to understand perfectly well
19/12/23, 4:03 pm - Tushti: Noted
19/12/23, 4:03 pm - Tushti: If you don't have any questions, we shall proceed further
19/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Yes I totally do
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: Alright Carlos, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
19/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Okay 
I would kindly ask if we can continue tomorrow
The phone is running low on battery now
19/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 274 4769: Thank you for your understanding
19/12/23, 4:15 pm - Tushti: Noted
19/12/23, 4:15 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
19/12/23, 4:15 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
19/12/23, 4:15 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE

TOPIC: Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient?

To begin with ,without the exposure of crop caring chemicals such as pesticides and disfectants , I support that there is not enough yield to sustain the efficiency needed for African diets. Not enough rain could manage the growth of crops alone ,so the irrigation programs of African farms are equiped well to maintain such yeilds that a good diet looks up to, for the good health of Africans . Well without the support of government officials on farming nationally. Most farms strive to feed the family and in addition not any income could be gained from it. With inflation upon the currency and few NGOs providing the seed to farm . The income generated from farming is really not enough to support the needs of the families in Zimbabwe as part of the African countries with the low economy of the countries depreciating at a rate increasing each year.

However most farms are able to provide on a national basis, supply in markets and meet the demands of the countries and even bring foreign currency to the country.
To end with it is true to a greater extent that Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient because of lack of sponsorship in the farming business .

"My Inspirational Story"
Growing up as the only boy in a family of 5 , strained my back and still does for the 19 years of my entire life since I was born. Not knowing what the world hold to me as I first took my breath into teenage hood. It came as a suprise that it was struggle after struggle as an extra hand was demanded for , the moment it became conscious that I could understand the way of money . My father took me out to his flea market on the holiday of my final year in grade 3 . He was happy to know that I had made sales and could calculate exchange rates of the different currencies we used in the period of inflation in Zimbabwe , the year 2013. 

Years passed , and my holidays became occupied with the hustle my father did . I soon become an extra and special hand that buying and selling was now my specialty. 

I became a young entrepreneur, and I was able to make monetary decisions on my own. 
The flea market business crushed later in the coming two years . Making a living became almost unbearable. 
In a family full of business minded people, an opportunity rose to surface as basic commodities were insufficient for the country as a whole. My mother saw the opportunity to get commodities out of the country and started the grocery business with as little as a box of frying oil. And with me in sight. I knew how she did it and became in line with selling it to the residents nearby . With that 
 A success story grew and my parents and my siblings would never sleep on an empty stomach
