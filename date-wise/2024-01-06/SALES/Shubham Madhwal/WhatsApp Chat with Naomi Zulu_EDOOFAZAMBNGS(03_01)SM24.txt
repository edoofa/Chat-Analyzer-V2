We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..

I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
05/01/24, 5:18 pm - +260 97 4615605: Diploma holder a nurse by profession
05/01/24, 5:22 pm - +260 97 4615605: What motivates  me to push her to be part of this program  is because my daughter is a very hard working girl and I really want her to go higher than I did in the levels of education
05/01/24, 5:23 pm - +260 97 4615605: I want her to become someone better than I am
05/01/24, 5:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mr Zulu*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

I believe that is exactly what you are looking forward to from the program for *Naomi*, right?
