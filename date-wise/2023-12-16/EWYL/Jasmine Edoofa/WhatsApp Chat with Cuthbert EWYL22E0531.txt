1. What are the benefits of the EDOOFA scholarship program
 • Students are able access high quality education at the top universities in India.
•students have a life long alumni membership and opportunities for employment.
•the students are put through a program known as earn while you learn ( EWYL). This program has given students an opportunity to reduce their fees as well as financial problems.

2. What is the EWYL program?
• a program which students undergo and get internship opportunities from influential organizations. This helps them gain valuable skills while studying. It also helps in self financing through earning scholarship credits. This program develops the students in their key areas which contribute to their success.
15/08/23, 8:47 am - +265 984 66 48 02: 3. How does a student's journey look like with the EDOOFA scholarship program?
Most of the students who have embarked upon the program are grateful for the conducive environment India is providing
•in terms of racism. India does not really care about racism and because of this, it is one of the most racial friendly countries in the world.
•in terms of cooperation, the students admire they never ending work that their mentors have put in and the strong groups formed among themselves.
•in terms of exposition the adult program has given a chance to students so that they may explore the white cultural diversity and which heritage India has. Most students are able to observe and appreciate the lifestyle of the local people.
15/08/23, 8:47 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Number 4. Write in detail about one of the students testimonials.

 In my view regarding the student testimonial in detail, here is my presentation.

In this case l will talk about Idowu Ruth Damilola.
Ruth is originally from Nigeria and she was a 2019 candidate who enrolled with the EDOOFA scholarship program. She is a master in chemistry student. She began her journey with EDOOFA when she received a 100% scholarship on tuition free and this helped most of her financial problems.
Back in Nigeria was not really exposed to practical work during her time in school. Most of the lectures never taught the students but only give them handouts to work on.
After going to India, Ruth began to experience hardworking lectures who don't miss their classes, expose their students to a lot of practical works and are always early in terms of punctuality.
Ruth has been enlightened by India's teaching methods and these methods were not available in her country. She has a good feeling that her dreams as a chemist would become reality.

In conclusion, Ruth is grateful for the experience she has gained from the  EDOOFA scholarship program.

3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
29/08/23, 8:49 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Ok
29/08/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
29/08/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
29/08/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 9:02 am - +265 984 66 48 02: What's going to happen to the people who have applied for the program
29/08/23, 9:03 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Will I still add them for more clarification
29/08/23, 9:03 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Or this the group will only have new members
29/08/23, 9:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You can keep on adding the students Cuthbert and educate them about the Edoofa Schoalrship Program.
29/08/23, 9:11 am - +265 984 66 48 02: This question still remains
29/08/23, 9:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You will share their forms with me and I will send the forms to the counselling team and our experienced counsellors will reach out to those students.
29/08/23, 9:12 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Ok understood
29/08/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
29/08/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
29/08/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 9:24 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Ok sure thing
29/08/23, 9:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
29/08/23, 9:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 9:28 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Ok that's great
29/08/23, 9:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

Q3. Lilongwe north west, Mpingu (kunyerere)
04/09/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
04/09/23, 9:08 am - +265 984 66 48 02: I got the Edoofa scholarship information from them. Itwas already in contact with EDOOFA mangers/team

04/09/23, 12:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am delighted to share some exciting news with you. Tomorrow, we embark on a journey to visit our esteemed universities for the orientation event, a momentous occasion that fills me with great anticipation. 

As we prepare for this enriching experience, *I want to inform you that our regular sessions for the next two days will be temporarily suspended.* However, fret not; we shall resume our engaging discussions and learning on *_Thursday, the 7th of September, 2023._*
During our visit, I promise to capture moments to share with you through pictures and updates. Until then, have a splendid and productive time, dear student!
04/09/23, 5:01 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: I hope you have a wonderful time and I will be waiting for the updates.
07/09/23, 8:14 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Good morning Ms. Jasmine.
How are you this morning
08/09/23, 8:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good morning*
I hope this message finds you in high spirits. I want to begin by sharing my excitement about the recent orientation program we organised. Meeting all the students in person was a truly delightful experience. It's been a journey of 7-8 months of staying in touch, and finally having the opportunity to meet face-to-face added a whole new dimension to our connection.
_*I can't express how much I'm looking forward to the day when we can meet in person as well. That moment will surely be something special.*_

Now, let's seize the day and dive into our session. Are you all ready?
08/09/23, 8:32 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Yes I am
08/09/23, 8:33 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Good morning to you too Ms Jasmine
08/09/23, 8:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I start, Let me give you a glimpse of the event
08/09/23, 8:34 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Alright
08/09/23, 8:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This message was deleted
08/09/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 8:41 am - +265 984 66 48 02: These are lovely Ms Jasmine. You really had a great time
08/09/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Indeed Cuthbert.
08/09/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we discussed Project 3.  So when the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
08/09/23, 8:48 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Oh ok
08/09/23, 8:49 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Most secondary schools in Malawi now are higher than $100 I believe
08/09/23, 8:51 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great. Let me share the reason with you.
08/09/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
08/09/23, 8:54 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Ok
08/09/23, 8:56 am - +265 984 66 48 02: I had a question. Are there any other projects apart from those which I have been introduced to?
08/09/23, 8:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Cuthbert- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
08/09/23, 8:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, there are other projects as well. But, In order to be eligible for those you have to perform well in our three basic projects that have been shared with you.
08/09/23, 9:00 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Oh ok
08/09/23, 9:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Do you have any other questions?
08/09/23, 9:02 am - +265 984 66 48 02: I think project 1 is still difficult for me to fully understand and complete
08/09/23, 9:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Corporate Alliance?
08/09/23, 9:03 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Yes
08/09/23, 9:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, But I hope you know that Project 1 is on hold right now. Are you aware of that?
08/09/23, 9:05 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Oh no I didn't know anything
08/09/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
08/09/23, 9:07 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Ok understood
08/09/23, 9:09 am - +265 984 66 48 02: One of the s students was telling me that he was not contacted Paul katayeni

08/09/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Job, now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- From now onwards, you will have your sessions on 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
08/09/23, 9:34 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Noted
08/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
08/09/23, 9:38 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Noted
08/09/23, 9:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
08/09/23, 9:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
08/09/23, 9:40 am - +265 984 66 48 02: So is this group over now or still useful for project 3
08/09/23, 9:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This group is very crucial as you will get all the important information in this group. Only your sessions will be conducted on the EWYL LINE
08/09/23, 9:45 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Okay understood
08/09/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Jasmine, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
08/09/23, 9:47 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Alright
08/09/23, 9:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
08/09/23, 9:50 am - +265 984 66 48 02: 😂😂ok I understand clearly
08/09/23, 9:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you know the reason?
08/09/23, 9:55 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Because have I been blessed with the opportunity to study abroad and fulfill my dreams
08/09/23, 9:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
08/09/23, 10:00 am - +265 984 66 48 02: Okay. Got it
08/09/23, 10:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, you can drop a message on the Line and I will get back to you there.
11/09/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon dear student*
I would like to tell you that I am back from the orientation program and we will be meeting tomorrow for our session. Also, I have shared your last week's newsletter on the EWYL LINE. 
If you have not received it, then quickly come on the EWYL LINE and write *NEWSLETTER*. Kindly acknowledge this message as well. 
Happy Reading!⭐
11/09/23, 3:02 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: I believe in being therapy. The fact about of becoming a therapist always gave me some kind of relief. Most youths nowadays are going through a lot of anxiety, stress, depression and much more. I really believe that these people are not so interested in talking to someone who they know but someone outside there circle
12/09/23, 12:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It's truly commendable that you have a strong belief in the power of therapy and a deep understanding of the challenges that many individuals, particularly young people, are facing today. Your aspiration to become a therapist and provide support to those who may prefer speaking with someone outside their immediate circle is both noble and impactful.
12/09/23, 12:49 pm - +265 984 66 48 02: Thanks it's just a thought which is mostly on my mind 😊
12/09/23, 12:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is good Cuthbert. Now, in order to avoid confusion, let us communicate on only one platform i.e. EWYL LINE

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday.
