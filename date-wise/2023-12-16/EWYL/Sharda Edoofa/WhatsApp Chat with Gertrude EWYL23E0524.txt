23/08/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Question 4 
According to Kurainashe Mumaniki
He said that It is an Edoofa initiative which helps students to earn scholarship credits through undertaking tasks with the Earn While You Learn Program run by SEELs which is an abbreviation for Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success. These are online tasks and they include social media marketing, market research, blogging, article writing, and online projects as well. This has helped me in improving my article writing skills and marketing skills. It has even enlarged my knowledge of the business world. The online tasks don’t even affect my learning because I just have to spare like 1-2 hours a day for the tasks. The SEELs program has helped me in paying my fees as I earn monthly credits, so it has helped me financially. Entrepreneurship is the core of today’s business and the SEELs program has helped me understand that investment is better than a salary because with a salary you can purchase goodies but with an investment, you build a fortune."
23/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It's time to wrap up today's session

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

17/10/23, 1:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon dear parent
I hope you are doing well

I am doing good. Thank you so much for asking. 
I am aware about examination getting started. Please do not worry at all, everything will be good.
Also, do convey my wishes to Gertrude for the examinations.
17/10/23, 1:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you can go through the newsletter and share your understanding of the same. This will ensure that we are on the same page.
17/10/23, 2:51 pm - +44 7385 872436: Good afternoon Ms Sharda.
I have gone through the Newsletter  
It's really rich with inspiring message from the creator of Edoofa Scholarship program. 
His opening remarks encourages students that the Willpower is the initial spark they they need to be motivated and Routine serves as the discipline that allow people to maintain it in the long run. It is crucial for students to set these essential guidelines. 
1. Clear goals should be in place
2. Clear path to attain these goals to be well defined. 
There were also 3 quotes for students, and the one by Oprah Winfrey spoke significantly to me : *Don't worry about being successful but work towards  being significant and success will naturally follow*
The creator went ahead and posed 2 questions to students,, . A book talking about Henry Ford's life was a recommended reading if a copy is available.  From this book Henry believed that providing value before seeking value is a wise approach. 
1. Do you align with Henry Ford 's belief that providing value before seeking it is a wise approach?
2. What kind of results or outcomes do you envision experiencing if you successfully apply this principle in your life?
Students are urged to reflect on these questions and how these can influence their professional pathways?

Lastly was the reflection of what transpired at the Capital Markets Quiz, High school competition, where a science student had taken part in this competition despite the fact that it was mainly for business studies students.  Indeed this made the student realise she can be anything in this world and can achieve anything.  What an inspiring lesson learnt there. 
In a nutshell that is what l understood from the Newsletter. 
Good day Ms Sharda
26/10/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Gertrude
I hope you are doing well

Kindly excuse me for the delay in reply. There has been some technical discrepancy at my end. 

Your understanding of the newsletter is outstanding. You've effectively summarized the key points, emphasizing the importance of willpower, clear goals, and the impact of Oprah Winfrey's quote. Your insight into the provided questions and the reflection on the Capital Markets Quiz is commendable. Well done!
26/10/23, 3:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Gertrude and parents! 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

I have noticed your unresponsiveness in the group. I would like to understand if everything is alright at your end. 

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

07/11/23, 12:28 am - +44 7385 872436: Good evening Ms Sharda.
So sorry for late responses.
I didn't know about this hindu festival,,, but from my research it is very important and is commemorated very much in the Hindu culture.
07/11/23, 12:34 am - +44 7385 872436: I am also very excited to hear that extracurricular activities are offered to students.  This is very good for them to socialise and keep physically fit.
I think Gertrude would enjoy regular gatherings and singing.
She also used to participate in tennis at school and also was keen to participate in volleyball. 
I definitely has always noticed her to be a social person who enjoys other people 's company,,, hence these extracurricular activities will make her life easier in India.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
04/12/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
05/12/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Ma'am so I should create a group and add these students
05/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Am I suppose to add you as well in the group
05/12/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes you can add me in the group. But, I will say anything in the group. I will be silently observing all your conversation.
05/12/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
*1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled*
*2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not*
05/12/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
05/12/23, 2:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.

07/12/23, 2:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.

Q2. A Good day to you Mrs Dzairo . My name is Gertrude Mbofana . Am a student who was enrolled by Edoofa . As a student it will be my honour to work with you to enlighten other students who would want to study abroad about Edoofa
This is a scholarship that's helps students to achieve their dreams of studying abroad

Q3 located in Matebeleland
07/12/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
07/12/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
07/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 687 6578: I agree ma'am
07/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Am ready ma'am

Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
07/12/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Gertrude, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
07/12/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will help you out.

07/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 687 6578: Well explained ma'am
I will do as you have said
07/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
07/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
07/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 687 6578: I will do that ma'am
