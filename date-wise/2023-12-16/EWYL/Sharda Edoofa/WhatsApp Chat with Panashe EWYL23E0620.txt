07/12/23, 8:30 am - Sharda Edoofa: *As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:*
*_Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room_*

Now, what does this mean to you?

Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.
So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.
Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
07/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 070 9740: To me it means you have to pose an impact on other people's lives so that you can be a successful brand
07/12/23, 8:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: our interpretation of the quote is spot on! The essence of "Your brand is what sets you apart, even when you're not in the room" indeed lies in the impact you make on others. Your personal brand is not just about how you see yourself but, more importantly, about the impression you leave on those around you.

By actively working to create a positive impact on people's lives, you are, in essence, building a successful personal brand. The way you contribute, connect, and make a difference leaves a lasting mark on others' perceptions of you. It's about consistently demonstrating your values, skills, and unique qualities in a way that resonates with those you interact with.
07/12/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 070 9740: Thanks for explaining more
07/12/23, 8:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: You are most welcome Panashe.
07/12/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now I want you to share your understanding of the audio so that we can move ahead with our project discussion.
07/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 070 9740: It is about how skills of networking helps students to achieve a future goal, it also creates a mindset in students so that they will be able to identify opportunities of creating an impact in life of others
07/12/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: That’s awesome-, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
07/12/23, 9:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
07/12/23, 9:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

07/12/23, 9:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
07/12/23, 9:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
07/12/23, 10:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: Are you there in the session?

14/12/23, 8:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
14/12/23, 8:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
14/12/23, 8:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
