16/08/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 869 0211: I am doing just fine
16/08/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 869 0211: Sure ma'am
16/08/23, 10:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning, champion! I am delighted to present you with the grant, and I want to express that your dedication and effort have yielded remarkable results. Your hard work has truly been rewarded, and I am thrilled to acknowledge your achievement in winning the 21-day grant challenge.
16/08/23, 10:28 am - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following?
16/08/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 869 0211: Thank you very much
16/08/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 869 0211: Yes l am
16/08/23, 10:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: Wonderful that is
16/08/23, 10:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 10:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 10:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 10:32 am - Sharda Edoofa: Are you there *Ruvimbo*?
16/08/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 869 0211: I am ma'am
16/08/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 869 0211: Just had a network problem but now it's okay
16/08/23, 12:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Ohh the networks were the concern.
16/08/23, 12:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for informing.
16/08/23, 12:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If you are ready, should we continue now?
16/08/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 869 0211: We can continue
16/08/23, 1:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright!

16/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 869 0211: Yes l did

15/09/23, 5:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/09/23, 5:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Evening , Ruvimbo
I hope that you are doing well. It has been a while since we last connected. 
I have been reminding you to message on the EWYL Line so that we can proceed with our scheduled sessions so that you don't miss out on the opportunities to earn scholarship credits and learn from the industrial academia that has been specifically curated for our Edoofians.

May I know what exactly is the challenge?
15/09/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 869 0211: Evening
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: How are you doing?
15/09/23, 8:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that I have noticed your unavailability in the EWYL Line, I want to know what problem you are facing?
15/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 869 0211: Due to the fact that l was not able to gather the fee  ....had decided to let go of the scholarship
15/09/23, 8:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Ruvimbo. What is your new plan now?
15/09/23, 8:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: And have you informed the admission team about it?
15/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 869 0211: Not sure yet
15/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 869 0211: Not yet still deciding
15/09/23, 9:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Ruvimbo. I understand there are times when such situations arise. During these we can focus on what is in our control. According to me, you should shift your focus on earning as much scholarship credits as you can.

Students from your batch have earned around 900$ to 1000$ of scholarship credits. All these people did is they worked on their projects very seriously. I am sharing this with you because I know you are equally capable of achieving what they did.
14/10/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 869 0211: Good morning
14/10/23, 11:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Ruvimbo
How are you doing?
14/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 869 0211: I am dng just fine and you
15/12/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Ruvimbo!

I hope this message finds you well. As *your exams are presumably completed,* I would like to discuss when you plans to return and *resume our EWYL sessions.* Your progress is important, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.

Please let me know your availability.
15/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 869 0211: Greetings mame....will resume with the EWYL sessions soon
15/12/23, 3:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Ruvimbo do let me know the exact date, we are already lagging behind in terms of learnings and earnings from our other peers.
