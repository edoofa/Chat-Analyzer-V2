23/11/23, 12:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Comfort!

I have noticed a consistent delay in our conversations due to your lack of punctuality. I hope you understand that you have committed to being available for your orientation sessions by signing a document. We won't be able to complete our orientation session on time if you continue to arrive so late.
23/11/23, 12:55 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes ma'am

Did you know that Africa is the second-largest continent, covering over 30 million square kilometers? Now, let's begin our session and explore the rich and diverse tapestry of knowledge awaiting us today!
23/11/23, 1:34 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Lets get started🥲
23/11/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes i understand it will be long and exciting at the same time..
Can i know more about these two key objectives?
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/11/23, 1:42 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright,,got that.
23/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: That sounds great
23/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes very🤭
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: I've noted
23/11/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
23/11/23, 2:21 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: I liked The debate part most
23/11/23, 2:22 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: And I've seen capability with Edoofians as they were on position 5
23/11/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As today wraps up, get excited for tomorrow, it's full of possibilities! 

We'll catch up at 1:30 pm to kickstart a new day of enthusiasm.
23/11/23, 2:28 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright ma'am
24/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Comfort!

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: Do you know that butterflies taste with their feet! They have special sensors on their tiny footpads that help them 'taste' their surroundings. It's like having a built-in flavor detector on their feet! 🦋👣
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Good afternoon,Ma'am🙂
24/11/23, 3:19 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Hello
24/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your session is just an hour long. I hope you understand that if you are going to be late, then we won't be able to have a fruitful discussion, and how will you earn credits? Therefore, it is suggested that from tomorrow, be on time.

27/11/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Comfort!

Did you know that India and Africa share a rich history of diplomatic and trade relations that dates back centuries? The strong bond between these two regions has been further strengthened in recent years through collaborative efforts in various sectors, including trade, infrastructure, and technology.

Let us cherish this amazing bond, and start our session !
27/11/23, 1:39 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Lets start😊
27/11/23, 1:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Comfort?
27/11/23, 1:44 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Sounds great!
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 1:48 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes it is clear
27/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
27/11/23, 1:50 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Im going through it right now....give me some minutes
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Are you done, Comfort?
27/11/23, 2:16 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Not yet
27/11/23, 2:18 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Should i explain about all the projects?or the first one?
27/11/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: All of them in brief!
27/11/23, 2:24 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright fine
27/11/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:30 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright Ma'am.... I'll share my understanding soon ...i am going through it
27/11/23, 3:28 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: The pdf is explaining more about job losses due to covid 19,,at the beginning..I have quoted that we have to be aware of how future jobs will look like and we also have to acquire skills that will be required to perform these jobs.
Some skills are enduring (they will always be there)and some are merging.
Skills that are merging can be acquired from online/digital skills and literacy,social media,data analytics,remote team work and many more while Emerging skills include networking,decision making and empathy just to mention a few. 
The first project is Corporate alliances.
In the first project,,students use skills to network with companies and potential employers.
Students connect with the decision makers of a local company in their country with Edoofa..But before that,a student gives Edoofa's message to the decision makers.. a student arranges for the signing of a contract and a video call at the decision makers free time..In the fifth activity  which is also the final stage,Students are required to report the entire activity ,what she/he has researched in a statistical way..
Project 2 is about community building..in this project,a student has to visit local schools and find senior high school students to help them get enrolled with the Edoofa scholarship program and for every activity from the beginning, a student gets credits,,,for example,when the group has been created,a student gets $2,,when he/she pays the first enrollment fee,$10 will be rewarded to the student...the credits go on to $35 according to how far they have gone with the process.
28/11/23, 12:15 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Good afternoon ma'am
28/11/23, 1:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, COmfort!

*_Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:_*

 The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.🤯🗼
28/11/23, 1:28 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Lets start🥳
28/11/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
28/11/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 1:43 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright ma'am
28/11/23, 2:39 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: I have understood
28/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly share your understanding in the next session since our session time i over now. 

Let us connect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I am sharing an important document, you have to read that too.
28/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright ma'am
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Have a good day.
29/11/23, 9:35 am - +265 996 02 44 72: My understanding from the audio is that...
The aim of the first project which is Corporate alliance is to understand the markets where we are to work in,in the future and start preparing ourselves for it at an early stage. I understand people are now working online due to the pandemic so we have to look for technologically driven companies that are digital in nature in our home country. I have to identify the people that are close to me that work in such companies and explain to them about my objectives,how im enrolled with Edoofa programme and how it is helping me acquire employability skills. So i have to create a LinkedIn account,a platform where I can look for those companies and employees working there & connect with the decision makers so that we talk to different managers and arrange a meeting with them and  Edoofa through a video call..depending on the agreed time.
29/11/23, 1:29 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Good afternoon🥲M.s Ananya
29/11/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Comfort!

As we embark on our session, here's another intriguing fact about India: The country is not only known for its diverse cultures but also for being home to the *world's highest cricket ground*.

29/11/23, 1:36 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Interesting
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Comfort, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

30/11/23, 1:46 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Noted
30/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, you must maintain regular communication with the students and address any queries they may have.
30/11/23, 1:50 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright
30/11/23, 1:51 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: so once they fill the form,,i can share the form on this group ?or with my counselor?
30/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You have to share the forms with me here!
30/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
30/11/23, 1:56 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright ma'am🥲
30/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
30/11/23, 1:56 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Go on
30/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
30/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
30/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
30/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
30/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
30/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

30/11/23, 2:10 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright,i got it.
30/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
30/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
30/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
30/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
30/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
30/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
30/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
30/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

30/11/23, 2:13 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Pardon me ma'am, but im from Malawi
30/11/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the same, actually, I have another student from Zimbabwe named as Comfort!
30/11/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Malawi*, where tuition fees range from K650,000 to K1,000,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K450,000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K800,000.↗

On average, parents in Malawi spend between K1,900,000 and K2,250,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.💥

*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Malawi, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.*

01/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
01/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 1:49 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright fine ill go through it 😊😊
01/12/23, 2:23 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: The third project is" African schools education reformation".
In this project,we have to reach out to schools and arrange meetings between the Edoofa program directors and the headmaster of any school in my region..First of all,i have to find a school in my area and talk to the headmaster/principle on how lucky i am to qualify for Edoofa program ,why i joined Edoofa and how i have planned my future..I also have to share Edoofa program details with them..i can use the cover letter from Edoofa to initiate conversations with the Headmaster...Im required to later on arrange a meeting with the headmaster and the Edoofa program director.
01/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations . However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
01/12/23, 2:27 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Not really...i understood them very well....however i can always get back to you for clarification.
01/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude our session today, reflect on the progress you've made and the insights gained. If there's anything specific you'd like to focus on in our future sessions, feel free to share. I wish you continued success and looking forward to our next session on Monday! 🌟
01/12/23, 2:38 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Have a great weekend😊
04/12/23, 8:06 am - +265 996 02 44 72: Good morning Miss Ananya😊...
Pardon me this week and the other,i am writing my end of semester examinations...So what time do you suggest that we can be having our sessions ?
04/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Comfort!

Let's start our session with an interesting tidbit about India. Did you know that the concept of 'zero' (0) as a mathematical digit was invented by Indian mathematician Aryabhata?

It's a remarkable contribution that has had a profound impact on mathematics and science globally. 🤯 <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 4:52 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Good afternoon ma'am
05/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Comfort!

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"🐝
05/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I was looking forward to a wonderful session today. Unfortunately, we couldn't connect. Now, I am expecting our session tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. to be fruitful., and I hope to see you there!

In the meantime, I would appreciate an explanation for why you were unable to attend our scheduled session. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
05/12/23, 5:25 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Im sorry madam....
As i said earlier.. We are writing end of semester examinations hence my absence
05/12/23, 5:25 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: I also stated it here🥲
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Comfort! So may I ask if you are  available now?
06/12/23, 3:13 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes i am right now
07/12/23, 1:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Comfort!

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
07/12/23, 5:54 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Good Afternoon ma'am
08/12/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Comfort!

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. However, I had a plan for our session, which I am stating now.

With years of experience, I want you to accumulate some credits before you come here to India. Students who have already earned some credits are living much better lives as they can help their parents with travel costs and even semester fees. I am sure you have also signed up for EWYL, so that you can do the same. As your mentor, I want to ensure that you utilize our services and earn for yourself. Now, have some faith in me and start working.

As a starting point, I have a small target for you for the day! Connect with at least *2 students* today under your community building project and submit the application forms to me by tomorrow. By tomorrow, you will either be successful with the two students or may face some challenges, on which we will work together!

All the best!
08/12/23, 8:41 am - +265 996 02 44 72: Good morning miss Ananya
11/12/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Comfort!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 3:40 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Good Afternoon ma'am😊
11/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: How are you doing, comfort?
11/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
11/12/23, 3:48 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Some ups and downs but im fine anyways😌
11/12/23, 3:48 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: How are you?
11/12/23, 3:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you fro asking, I am doing great! <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 3:50 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Pardon madam,,but here you are asking for details for which school?
Is it the school that i received the offer letter from?
11/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: No, the one you are doing your A-level from.
11/12/23, 4:02 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: It was a boarding school.... So far away from my home...
Its in another city and region
11/12/23, 4:03 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Usually it would take us a very long journey on the bus probably the whole day traveling
11/12/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, do you have the contact number of your school head?
11/12/23, 4:06 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: I should ask for it from my old schoolmates then i'll  give it to you
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Later on
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: I lost it
11/12/23, 4:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
11/12/23, 4:24 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: My question is in community building..
As a student, do i start earning the credits right after finding other students to join Edoofa?..Or after the pay the first enrollment fee?
11/12/23, 4:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You will start earning credits once they pay the first enrollment fee.
11/12/23, 4:26 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright
11/12/23, 4:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday  and Friday-  12:00 pm to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/12/23, 4:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
11/12/23, 4:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Good afternoon ma'am
I would like share my understanding on today's Wednesday wisdom.
Starting with Honesty,as a pillar of success,i understand is all about being truthful and sincere in your words and actions.one should first of all be true with oneself then others because it builds trust,strengthens relationships and promotes integrity..College students need this virtue..One has to be true to oneself first in order to set realistic goals,discover strengths and weaknesses.
Honesty is also important in the academic realm to professors and fellow students in order to succeed.
13/12/23, 1:59 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Another pillar of success is hard work.
