11/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
11/09/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes l'm ready
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

11/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I am available
11/09/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/09/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
11/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Noted
11/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 133 8660: It is clear
11/09/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
11/09/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
11/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay
11/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes I understand
11/09/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/09/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
11/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 71 133 8660: It is very clear
11/09/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
11/09/23, 8:35 pm - +263 71 133 8660: We can proceed
11/09/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
11/09/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
11/09/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
11/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I'm ready
11/09/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
11/09/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

11/09/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
11/09/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
11/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Internet connection is poor here. I'll be done tomorrow by 12:00 pm
11/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand in that case, Let us reconnect tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
12/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 133 8660: How are you Mrs Kirti l did go through the videos. I was about to tell you.
12/09/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. That is good to know, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
12/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 71 133 8660: The first video
Important Message for Enrolled Students. Students should be teachable and open minded hence you can reach far with the help of Edoofa. Students should also follow instructions. Second video Edoofa vision for you. It focuses on what we will be after being part of Edoofa. On videon 3 schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa. Edoofa is associated with a lot of universities which they know they can offer the best accommodation, education and many more. So Edoofa chooses the best universities for us.  For over 10 years Edoofa have identified the best universities. Video 4 preparation for lnteractive sessions with schools. 
Statement of purpose is an important document. Students should be prompt in taking action and diligent in filling the form
12/09/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/09/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/09/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
12/09/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Thank you for clarifying further
12/09/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*

14/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Is there such a thing as a social structure that constrains individual action or is society nothing more than a figment of our imagination?

Soxial structure os a concept in sociology that refers to the distinctive, stable arrangement of institutions whereby human beings in a society interact and live together. It is often treated together with the concept of social change, which deals with the forces that change the social structure and the organization of society. Social structure is a patterned social relation that selects only certain elements from ongoing social activities. It is not a figment of our imaginations but rather a real phenomenon that shapes our lives and constrains individual action.
Social structures constrain individual action but shaping the opportunities and resources available to individuals and groups to engage in competition, cooperation or conflict. People who take part in a social structure become elements of that structure. Social structures can be seen as a set of rules or norms that govern behavior within a society. These rules can be formal or informal, explicit or implicit, and they can be enforced by various means such as lwas, customs, traditions or social pressure.
In conclusion, social structure is not a figment of our imagination but rather a real phenomenon that shapes our lives and constrains individual action. It is a patterned social relation that selects only certain elements from ongoing social activities. Social structures can be seen as a set of rules and norms that govern behavior within a society. They shape the opportunities and resources available to individuals and groups to engage in competition, cooperation  and conflict.

3. Please explain the realtion between sociology and economics

Sociology amd and economics are two social sciences that have a close relationship. The two fields are so closely related that one is often treated as a branch of the other. Society is greatly influenced by economic factors and economic processes are largely determined by the environment of the society. Economics deals with the economic activities of man, including production, consumption and distribution of wealth. The economic factors play a vital role in the very aspect of our social life. Total development of an individual depends very much on economic factors. Without economic conditions, the study of society is quite impossible. All the social problems are directly connected with the economic conditions of the people. Sociology on the other hand is concerned with studying human society  and social behavior. It examines how people interact with each other and how they form groups and societies. Sociologists have contributed to the study  of different aspects of  economic organizations such as property system, division of labour , occupation etc, which are provided to economists.

4. What is the role of institution in society - do they perform positive functions or simply work in the powerful and against the powerless? Elaborate with example.

Institutions are a part of the social order of society and they govern behaviour and expectations of individuals, while at the same time they regulate business operations and ethics. In fact, the morality of institutions is guaranteed by process of social evolution. Institutions also have an important redistributive role to play in the economy. They make sure that resources are properly allocated and ensure that the poor or those with fewer economic resources are protected. The positive funstions of institutions in the society is that they provide moral ideas, knowledge and modes of behavior are transferred from one generation to another through the medium of institution. This helps younger generation in the solution of the problems confronting it. Institutions also control human behavior. 
Institutions do not work in the powerful and against the powerless society. Actually they work as the backbone of a society. Without the social institutions, a society cannot achieve fulfillment in terms of economy, academy or relationships for examples schools, religion, hospital and prisons
14/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 133 8660: 5. Explain primary amd secondary groups as the two sociological groups and elaborate with examples about in groups as subtypes of primary and secondary groups.

Primary groups are small, intimate groups with close, personal relationships that last a long time. They are typically based on shared values, norms, and experiences. Examples of primary include family, close friends, religious groups, sports team, neighborhood groups. Primary groups are small,  close - knit groups with strong emotional bonds between members. They are typically characterized by face to face interaction, intimacy, and shared values. Primary groups play an important role in socialization, providing individuals with a sense of belonging and support. Secondary groups are larger, more impersonal groups that are typically formed for specific purposes, such as work or education. Relationships in secondary groups are often more formal and task - oriented than in primary groups. Examples of secondary groups include school classes, sports teams, and work teams. Secondary groups are larger, more impersonal groups that are often formed to achieve a specific goal. They are typically less emotional intense than primary groups and may be more temporary.

14/09/23, 6:56 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes that's true
14/09/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay
14/09/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 240 6132: Is it August 2024?

15/09/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Rufaro.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, as I was going through your counseling conversation, I am sure that you are aware that you can arrive in India by January 2024, however, for that to happen you would require to complete all the formalities by 15th of October 2023.
15/09/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you must be aware the academic session in India commences in August only, however, if you wish to arrive in India by January 2024, you would need to register yourself with the university with this year's intake which will be by 15th of October 2023, along with the 1st-semester fee, for that your year of intake will be considered for October 2023, so considering all that, may I know if you are ready to arrive in January 2024 mentally and financially as we would need to be proactive in these months for your registration also?
15/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes I am ready
15/09/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263711338660 I am sure you as a student is excited to start with higher education however, please let us wait for your parents to acknowledge the message as well, and once they confirm the same then let us move on with the admission process.
15/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay

16/09/23, 7:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Rufaro.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move forward with the admission process without any delays?
16/09/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 240 6132: Sorry for l late response, am not always networked due to my type of work, sometime will in a lecture
16/09/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 240 6132: Am connected now
16/09/23, 11:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand completely, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/09/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 240 6132: Yes madam, let's proceed
16/09/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Sociology, for your higher education in India as per the October 2023 intake and arrive in India in January 2024?
16/09/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 240 6132: Yes madam, correct
16/09/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
16/09/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 240 6132: Am ready
16/09/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
16/09/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
16/09/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
16/09/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 240 6132: Sure the student has to choose one
16/09/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
16/09/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
16/09/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
16/09/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes
16/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I'm ready
16/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I would like Chandigarh University or Lovely Professional University
16/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes that's true
16/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 78 240 6132: Following
19/09/23, 8:46 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Hello Ms Kirti
20/09/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rufaro.

I hope you are doing well, Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.
20/09/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Wow l can't wait to come
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I understand
20/09/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that and even I can not wait to meet you in person. May I know if you are available to connect with us now
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes I am
20/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, may I know if you are clear here?
20/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I went to same school with Lisa the one in pink top
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I'm clear
20/09/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know @263711338660, I had a great time connecting with Lisa in person, she is just a great girl, and we clicked so many pictures together too.
20/09/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 133 8660: That's great
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I understand
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
20/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Oh okay okay
20/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I understand
20/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Is it possible for student to be a non resident of the school and rent somewhere near the school
20/09/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263711338660 yes Off-campus accommodation is also provided, and many Edoofains are already staying off- campus, however I would like you be be patient here please as each and everything will be discussed in detail as be move ahead.
20/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
20/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay understood
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay
20/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 133 8660: It is c
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 133 8660: It is clear
20/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 240 6132: I think it's clear currently we should focus on paying the usd750 within 2 weeks, isn't it
20/09/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263782406132 thank you for your query, let me tell you that you are absolutely correct.
20/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Noted with thanks
20/09/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
20/09/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay thank Ms Kirti.
20/09/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 240 6132: Thank you so much dear

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 133 8660: 1. 900 USD
2.3 years ( 6 semesters)
3. 300 USD
4.750 USD
27/09/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Sorry for late replies Mr Milan
28/09/23, 10:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rufaro!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
28/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 240 6132: Good morning sir. Rufaro once suggested Chardigan university  not with at current. She said she has familiar students at that university
28/09/23, 2:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I have taken a note of what you have mentioned here and we will discuss it towards the end of our discussion. For now, let us move ahead. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
28/09/23, 2:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
28/09/23, 2:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
28/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay
28/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Noted
28/09/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
28/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes we are together
28/09/23, 3:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
28/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 133 8660: It's clear
28/09/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
28/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 133 8660: It is clear
28/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
28/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
28/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
28/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 133 8660: It is clear
28/09/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/09/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I'm in Harare
28/09/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/09/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/09/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay noted
28/09/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
28/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes sir
28/09/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
28/09/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Thank you
28/09/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
28/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 133 8660: It is clear
28/09/23, 4:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/09/23, 4:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 133 8660: It is clear
28/09/23, 4:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 133 8660: It is clear
28/09/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Everything is clear Mr Milan and l'm going to work hard in the EWYL program to reduce my cost of education
28/09/23, 4:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
28/09/23, 4:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

28/09/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
28/09/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay Mr Milan
28/09/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, have a good day ahead.

2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?

4. 700 USD
29/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Rufaro, in point number one, please go through it again and then let me know of that.
29/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay

29/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 133 8660: 975 USD
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. To provide you with a better understanding of the offer letter, I would like to assist you in breaking down the fee structure of Lovely Professional University.
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $3825.
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $3150.
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Compared to the on-campus accommodation, if you prefer more affordable housing and don't want to stay on campus, you can choose off-campus accommodation. The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.
29/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay it is clear
29/09/23, 2:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
29/09/23, 2:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

29/09/23, 8:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Rufaro,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Vilsha, the Head of Admissions* at Edoofa. I have been trying to get in touch with you over the calls to help and guide you with your offer letter from Lovely Professional University. Unfortunately, it seems that our call attempts have not been successful.
29/09/23, 8:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Could you kindly reach out to me at your earliest convenience?
29/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Evening Mr Milan , my sencere apologies for being late
I am facing network problems.
29/09/23, 8:42 pm - +263 71 133 8660: How are you Ms Vilsha?
29/09/23, 9:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am doing well Rufaro, thank you for asking. Is the network stable for the call tomorrow?
29/09/23, 9:26 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes it is stable.
29/09/23, 9:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Okay Rufaro, please give me a call.
29/09/23, 9:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Rufaro,

As we discussed during our recent call, you now have two offer letters in hand, one from Lovely Professional University and another from Galgotias University, both offering opportunities for your higher education. It's time to make a crucial decision regarding which university you'd like to enroll in. Depending on your choice, you'll need to complete the necessary admission formalities and secure your scholarship seat with the chosen university.
29/09/23, 9:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: If you decide to pursue your education at Lovely Professional University starting in January 2024, please note that you will be considered for the academic intake of August 2023. This means you would take a term off for the first semester. To initiate your admission process, you are required to make a registration fee payment of $700, which must be completed by tomorrow, 12:00 PM, on September 30, 2023, as it's the last date for admission for the 2023 intake.
29/09/23, 9:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, if you feel you need more time to decide, the next available intake for Lovely Professional University is in August 2024, and you can opt for that. It's important that you have a conversation with your parents as soon as possible to discuss your options and provide us with an update. This will allow us to assist you in making the right decision and guide you accordingly. Your education is a significant step, and we want to ensure it aligns with your preferences and goals.
29/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Mrs Vilsha we will come back to you tomorrow with the final answer. My parents are not sure yet.
29/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay noted
29/09/23, 10:59 pm - +263 78 240 6132: Evening Ms Vilsha what about deadline for payment at Galgotias university.
The sudden deadline hit us unexpectedly
30/09/23, 9:33 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning to the parents and Rufaro,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to clarify that the deadlines for your university admissions are contingent upon the academic intake you intend to pursue. Here are the specifics:
30/09/23, 9:34 am - Vilsha Edoofa: 1. *For the 2023 Batch:*
   - *Lovely Professional University:* To secure your admission for the 2023 intake at LPU, you are required to complete the university admission process and make a registration fee payment of $700 by today, before 12:00 PM.
   - *Galgotias University:* If you prefer Galgotias University for the 2023 intake, you have a bit more time, with a payment deadline of $750 by the 10th of October.

2. *For the 2024 Intake:*
   - If you are inclined towards the 2024 intake, as discussed with Mr. Milan, we can work out a payment plan that provides you with more time, given the extended timeline for the academic intake of 2024.
30/09/23, 9:34 am - Vilsha Edoofa: The reason for the relatively sudden deadline for the 2023 intake is that the academic intake for August 2023 is closing today at LPU and on the 10th at Galgotias University. This necessitates us to make well-informed and quick decisions to secure your place. 

Your educational journey is important to us, and we want to ensure you have the necessary information to make the right choice.
30/09/23, 9:35 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With that being said, I would like to inquire whether you've had the opportunity to discuss your options as a family and determine the best course of action for your university admission? 

This will allow me to assist you effectively in securing your scholarship seat, considering the limited time available. Your decision is crucial, and we are here to support you every step of the way.
30/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 133 8660: Good morning Ms Vilsha. I'm on my way to the bank to pay the registration fee 700USD
30/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 240 6132: Is it the same account that we use for fees
30/09/23, 10:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Parents and Rufaro. It is the same account. If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

04/10/23, 6:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Rufaro,

I trust this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. Firstly, I would like to extend my apologies for not being able to connect with you earlier.
04/10/23, 6:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It was a long weekend here in India, which was followed by a national holiday on Monday, for Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. I hope you must have had the opportunity to learn about him and the principles he abided by.
04/10/23, 6:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Gandhi Ji was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a staunch advocate of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change. Because of all his contributions, Gandhi Jayanti holds significant importance to us as an annual national holiday in India.
04/10/23, 6:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that we're back to our regular operations today, I am delighted to let you know that I am available for our daily sessions. Hence, could you please confirm your availability at this moment so that we can proceed further with our discussion and move forward with your university admisison journey?
04/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I'm ready
04/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay
04/10/23, 6:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, Rufaro. I would like to inform you that the $700 payment you made on Saturday has been confirmed by our accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials about it. The university has processed your admission acceptance letter, which we expect to receive tomorrow morning.
04/10/23, 6:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Once we receive the acceptance letter, we will immediately share it with you here in your admission group. In the meantime, I would like to inquire about the status of the remaining balance amount of $77, which constitutes the 11% International Transfer Charges. Have you and your family decided on a date for making this payment, as it is a crucial step in completing your admission formalities?
04/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I'll inform my parents about it
04/10/23, 7:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely, Rufaro, that works well. Could you please let me know when you anticipate having a discussion with your parents about the same and by when will you be able to provide me with feedback? This information will help me schedule my conversation with the university to keep them updated.
04/10/23, 7:06 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Tomorrow by 12:00 pm
04/10/23, 7:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, Rufaro, that is perfectly fine, in that case, let us conclude our conversation for today and we can reconnect with each other tomorrow in the afternoon.
04/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay Ms Vilsha
05/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Greetings
My parents said they will pay the remaining balance in 2 weeks time.
05/10/23, 1:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Rufaro,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. Thank you for sharing this update with me, I have duly noted it and can convey it to the university as well. However, Rufaro, given that your admission is for the 2023 intake, and you plan to take the first semester off and join the university in January 2024, there are some time-sensitive formalities to complete.
05/10/23, 1:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Specifically, it's crucial that you settle the balance charges of $77 before October 15th, and your first-semester fee balance should be paid by October 30th. To ensure you meet these deadlines, I would strongly recommend having a conversation with your parents to help them better understand these requirements.
05/10/23, 1:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Once you've taken note of this update and discussed it with your family, please let me know, and I'll be more than happy to assist you with your acceptance letter from the university.
05/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I thought the fee would be paid once I join the university
05/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I'll inform my parents
05/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 78 240 6132: Evening madam, am lost a bit, l seek clarity on first semester fees, do you mean the 77 remaining or there's another fee.

To my understanding the usd700 wash the one which was supposed to be paid by 30th October but the date shifted because the  LPU has a deadline of earlier for intake.
Which is which

Please expatiate am getting confused
06/10/23, 1:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Rufaro,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to extend my apologies for not being able to continue our conversation regarding your university admission the other day. Unfortunately, I was unavailable when you replied to my messages.
06/10/23, 1:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Nonetheless, I am pleased to see that you made the most of the time and had a discussion with your parents regarding your higher educational plans and the remaining fee formalities for the January 2024 intake. Rest assured, @263773204218, I will provide you with the further clarity you need and ensure that you have a thorough understanding to complete the formalities in a timely manner.
06/10/23, 1:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, before we get into that, as promised earlier, I wanted to share your admission acceptance letter. Please take the time to review the letter, and once you have done so, kindly let me know. I will then reconnect with you for further discussions.
06/10/23, 1:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 5:27 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I have gone through the document
07/10/23, 7:06 am - +263 78 240 6132: Thank you Ms Vilsha,
Have gone through the document but will you breakdown the key issues in this Doc for better understanding.
Points that needs attention and with deadline, it's really a lot of stuuff in the document,
As a family this is our 1st engagement to such programs.
07/10/23, 7:07 am - +263 78 240 6132: Please do so in time to clarify about financial issues
07/10/23, 8:32 am - +263 71 133 8660: Hello Ms Vilsha my offer letter states that my intake is 2nd week of August and here you states that January 2024 intake. I'm not understanding
09/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 133 8660: How are you Ms Vilsha
10/10/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 240 6132: Will try best to be available, will in lectures though
10/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Greetings Ms Vilsha
10/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 133 8660: May you please tell us the fees which needs to be paid and the due date and highlight the major points which needs attention
10/10/23, 2:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon to you as well Rufaro,

I am pleased to see that you are available for our discussion, and I am more than willing to assist you with any queries you may have. However, to ensure that I can provide you with the right guidance, let me begin by clarifying the details regarding the academic intake.
10/10/23, 2:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Each year, there is only one academic intake, which is scheduled for the month of August. As a student, you have the option to join either the August 2023 intake or the August 2024 intake. Given that you needed some additional time to prepare for your arrival in India, you were not in a position to join the August 2023 intake. However, you also didn't want to wait until the August 2024 intake.
10/10/23, 2:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In such a scenario, there is a provision that allows students to enroll in the August 2023 batch and take a term off for the first semester, spanning from August to December. Following this term off, you will arrive in India in January 2024 and commence your second semester.
10/10/23, 2:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This provision was specifically offered to you, which is why your admission process was prioritized, and you were given a brief window to complete it. Hence, the intake mentioned in your academic letter is August 2023. 

Please let me know if this explanation clarifies your understanding of the academic intake process, I would be happy to provide more information regarding the term off and the formalities that need to be addressed for the same.
10/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I understood the intake process
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you're interested in learning more, Rufaro. Let me provide you with a detailed explanation of how the term off application process works:
10/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay
10/10/23, 2:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Once you arrive in India in January 2024, your academic journey will kick off with Semester 2 of your degree program. This is where your formal coursework will begin.

On that note, let us also get into the term off, which is essentially a structured break during the academic year. This period coincides with the summer vacation and offers you a unique opportunity. 

During the term off, you will focus on catching up with the material from Semester 1. The primary aim here is to ensure that you are in sync with your fellow students and won't fall behind in your studies. Typically, term off classes are scheduled from May to July.
10/10/23, 2:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: After this dedicated period of study during the summer vacation, you will be well-prepared to resume your regular academic schedule. You will seamlessly transition into Semester 3, continuing your education alongside the classmates who initially started their studies in August 2023.

This approach allows you to strike a balance between your academic progress and the need for additional preparation time, making sure you're fully equipped to excel in your degree program. I hope this gives you a bit more insight?
10/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 133 8660: So I will catch up the 1 semester material in May to July right?
10/10/23, 2:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct Rufaro. I am pleased that we are in sync. Now, let's also get into how a student manages his/her tuition fees during term offs. As you are already aware, your tuition fee per semester stands at $975. Given that you will be covering two semesters (Semester 1 and Semester 2) during your term off, the total tuition fee due for your first year will amount to $1950.
10/10/23, 2:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In addition to the tuition fees, there are a couple of essential charges to consider. The per annum examination fee comes to $150, and the health insurance fee amounts to $50. When you combine these fees, the total amount payable to the university for your first year of education totals $2150.
10/10/23, 2:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that we are in agreement with this breakdown of fees?
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I understand
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes we are together
10/10/23, 2:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you have a clear understanding of the term off procedures, Rufaro. Now, let's discuss the payment of the fees. The total fee of $2150 that we just discussed does not need to be paid all at once.

As you have already paid a registration fee of $700, this amount will be adjusted against your total fees. Therefore, the remaining balance is $1450, which can be conveniently disbursed throughout the year according to the following schedule:

1. $450 in the month of October 2023.
2. $450 in the month of January 2024.
3. $550 in the month of April 2024.

This payment plan allows you to spread out the financial commitment over several months, making it more manageable and accommodating your financial needs. I hope you are clear with this as well?
10/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Yes it is clear
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Rufaro. Now that we are on the same page, it is important for you to start with the formalities of the admisison. Hence, it's essential to inform the academic board about your decision. You can do this by sending an email to academicboard@edoofa.com. This helps us ensure that your academic records are updated correctly.

I hope this explanation clarifies what taking a term off means and how it can be a beneficial option for students who need to catch up on their coursework. At the same time, you would have to fill in the below term off form and submit the same to us at your earliest so that we can update the university and get the formalities done.
10/10/23, 3:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 133 8660: What exactly am I informing the academic board?
10/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 133 8660: I will fill the form and send tomorrow
10/10/23, 3:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: When informing the academic board, you should provide them with a clear and concise message about your intention to take a term off and your plan to join the academic program in January 2024. In the same mail, you can attach the filled-in term-off application form as well. Here is what you should include in your communication to the academic board:

1. Your Intention: Begin by stating your intention to take a term off from the academic program. Be clear that you will not be attending classes for the first semester, which is typically from August to December.

2. Term Off Plan: Explain that you will use this term off to prepare for your arrival in India and to catch up on Semester 1 coursework during the summer vacation (May to July). At the same time, you will abide by the fee commitments for the same process.

3. Joining Date: Mention that you plan to join the academic program in January 2024, specifically for Semester 2.

4. Request for Confirmation: Politely request confirmation from the academic board regarding the acceptance of your plan and any specific steps or formalities you need to complete for the term off and rejoining in January 2024.

5. Contact Information: Provide your contact information (admission group name and phone number) so that the academic board can easily reach out to you for any further details or clarification.

10/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Okay thank you
10/10/23, 3:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Rufaro. Before we conclude our conversation for today, may I know if you have any queries that you would like to ask so far?

10/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 133 8660: Oh okay okay
12/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 133 8660: How are you Ms Vilsha ?
What should l write on the reason for the Term Off
12/10/23, 4:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon to both the parents and Rufaro,

I am doing well, thank you for asking and I hope you are doing well too. 

Regarding the term off request, you can mention that you need additional time to adequately prepare for your arrival in India. To make sure you don't miss out on your academic progress, you are willing to commence your studies with the second semester in January. This way, you can better align your schedule with your preparations and ensure a smooth transition to your higher education journey. <This message was edited>

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to begin by offering my apologies for not being able to reconnect with you over the past couple of days. 

The universities have officially commenced the preparations for the August 2024 intake, and as a result, I had some crucial meetings with our affiliated universities, including Lovely Professional University.
17/10/23, 8:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: These meetings were centered around discussions regarding the endowment benefits for the 2024 academic year, and they were regrettably unavoidable. Due to these unforeseen commitments, we were unable to connect with you earlier, and we are truly grateful for your patience during this time.
17/10/23, 8:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, I have an important update to share. As you may recall, Ms. Ashi from our team was scheduled to assist you with your visa application process. I am pleased to inform you that she has recovered well and will be able to connect with you tomorrow before 9:00 AM to guide you through the remaining procedures.

Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you the past couple of days, we were celebrating a major Indian festival - "Festival of Lights" which is also known as Diwali. 

It is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
14/11/23, 3:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The significance of Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil.
