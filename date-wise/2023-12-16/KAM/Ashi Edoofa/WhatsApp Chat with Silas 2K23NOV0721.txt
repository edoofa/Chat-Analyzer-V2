20/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
20/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/11/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

20/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes

20/11/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
20/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes
20/11/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
20/11/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/11/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

20/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 717 9272: How long does you need to pay for the registration fee
20/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 717 9272: So this fee is in-line with your first year fee or it is on its own
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your concern regarding the registration fee payment. Let me help you understand that you don't need to pay the registration fee charges now, as you will receive multiple offers from the Universities and once you make your final decision regarding the university choice then we will apply for your admission at that time you need to pay the registration charges. 

Regarding your concern with first year fees, you will get more clarity on this as we move forward with the admission journey. However, Let me share an insight with you that the registration fees is indeed included in your first year fees. I hope your doubt is clear, Kindly don't worry as we will guide you at every step and make sure that your admission journey is smooth.

23/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Let discuss them maybe I will understand more
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes
23/11/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
23/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
23/11/23, 3:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you share your response for these documents and complete the SOP form that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
24/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Silas, I hope you are doing well.

With reference to my previous message, I believe you had a chance to go through them however we have not received your response. Considering the same, I would like to know if you are facing any challenges, I am genuinely concerned and would appreciate it if you could share any issues or concerns that might be hindering our sessions.

Additionally, I would like to arrange a suitable time for us to reconnect and continue our session. Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.
24/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 717 9272: After noon sir how are you
24/11/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine dear, thank you for asking.
24/11/23, 5:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you were having any challenges as we were waiting for your response?
24/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 717 9272: They is a problem with Electricity here sir
24/11/23, 5:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know that you were having challenges with electricity, However I am glad to know that you are able now for the session. On this note, May I know if you have taken a note of the documents shared with you the other day?
24/11/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I have completed this one
24/11/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263787179272, Please make sure to complete the rest of the document by today. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelors in Computer Application* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
24/11/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 717 9272: It's accurate sir
24/11/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
24/11/23, 5:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
24/11/23, 5:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
24/11/23, 5:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
24/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 717 9272: This message was deleted
24/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes
24/11/23, 5:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
24/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Noted sir
24/11/23, 5:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
24/11/23, 5:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
24/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes sir
24/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
24/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Does this cost include school fee
24/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 717 9272: University fee
24/11/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share an example for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
24/11/23, 5:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup and your query is assisted?*
24/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I get it sir
24/11/23, 5:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
24/11/23, 5:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
24/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
24/11/23, 5:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263787179272. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
24/11/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
24/11/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
24/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Noted sir
24/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 717 9272: No sir
24/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 881 1227 left

Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth.

24/11/23, 6:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

25/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
25/11/23, 12:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
25/11/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/11/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
25/11/23, 12:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your  as a frontier person in this endeavor.

25/11/23, 12:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/11/23, 12:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/11/23, 12:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you? <This message was edited>

25/11/23, 12:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
25/11/23, 12:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?

25/11/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/11/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/11/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

25/11/23, 12:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263787179272, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I would like to know it
25/11/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/11/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/11/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/11/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
25/11/23, 12:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes
25/11/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
25/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
25/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/11/23, 1:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?

25/11/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
25/11/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?

It breaks down communication into seven layers, each of which performs a specific function. The layers are, from top to bottom: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical. The OSI model is used as a reference for understanding the complex process of communication on a network. The Application layer is responsible for handling the user interface and business logic of applications. The Presentation layer is responsible for formatting data into a form that can be understood by the Application layer. The Session layer establishes and maintains connections between devices on a network. The Transport layer is responsible for reliable delivery of data over a network. The Network layer routes data between devices on a network. The Data Link layer is responsible for data encapsulation and addressing, as well as error detection and correction. The Physical layer deals with the physical transmission of data, including modulation and encoding. So, the Data Link layer provides error-free transfer of data frames between devices on a network, while the Physical layer ensures the reliable transmission of those data frames over a physical medium

A programming language is a set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute to perform a specific task. There are many different programming languages, each with its own unique syntax and set of features. Common programming languages include C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.There are many programming languages that are widely used today, but some of the most popular include Java, Python, and JavaScript. Java is widely used because it's a general-purpose language that's fast, secure, and easy to learn. Python is popular because it's easy to read and write, and it's widely used for web development and data science. JavaScript is the most popular language for web development, and it's also used for creating dynamic web content and mobile apps.

The main difference is that compilers translate code into machine language (code that can be directly executed by the computer) before the program runs, while interpreters translate code into machine language as the program is running. Compilers are typically faster than interpreters, but they can take longer to create the machine code. Interpreters are slower but are easier to debug and make changes to.

15/12/23, 5:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?

2:$0
3:1600
4:$250
5:$1000
15/12/23, 5:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 717 9272: It is sir
15/12/23, 5:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?

15/12/23, 5:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 717 9272: What about food sir
15/12/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I'm done
15/12/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I also want to know regarding the question I once asked about fee for reserving my seat
15/12/23, 6:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with the food here. The university will provide you with the opportunity to cook your own food at your accommodation, which means you have the liberty to eat your home-cooked meals. It will cost the students a monthly expense of $40 to $50 to gather groceries or even sometimes order food from outside the university, giving you affordability and convenience too. I hope I am clear on this?
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Okay so the University do not offer food
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding this please don't worry as we have detailed about the registration fees later in our sessio.
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Okay
15/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1850, let me also guide you on how we can make your  education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?

15/12/23, 6:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1850. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1850- $1000 = $850, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/12/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
15/12/23, 6:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/12/23, 6:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
15/12/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I can say you are saying it is in-line with the 1850 and after paying it I will have 850 as remaining fee
15/12/23, 6:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263787179272, After paying your registration fees which is $1000 you will have a remaining balance of $850 please. With this, I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
15/12/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
15/12/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
15/12/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I understand
15/12/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
15/12/23, 7:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
15/12/23, 7:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
15/12/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 717 9272: No sir
15/12/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 717 9272: But my question is the registration fee is supposed to be paid at once
15/12/23, 7:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, we have a flexible payment plan which we will share with you, however could you please share your response for my above question please?
15/12/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I'm okay with this one sir and also I researched somehow about the University so I'm quite interested in this offer
15/12/23, 7:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see that @263787179272 . Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1850- $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
15/12/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
15/12/23, 7:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 28th, 2023*.
15/12/23, 7:47 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes sir
15/12/23, 7:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 717 9272: You may explain sir
15/12/23, 8:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$450 before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 8:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before December 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
15/12/23, 8:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/12/23, 8:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/12/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I stay in Kadoma
15/12/23, 8:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/12/23, 8:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/12/23, 8:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/12/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
15/12/23, 8:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
15/12/23, 8:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/12/23, 8:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/12/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
15/12/23, 8:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
