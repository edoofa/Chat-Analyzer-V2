For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 056 8487: We are ready.
27/09/23, 8:17 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you, yes you may start.
27/09/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/09/23, 8:37 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you
27/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
27/09/23, 8:51 pm - +27 78 844 5287: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 8:51 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you for the clarification
27/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 056 8487: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 056 8487: They are clear.
27/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/09/23, 9:02 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted with thanks.
27/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Noted.
27/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 056 8487: All clear sir.
27/09/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/09/23, 9:06 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Much appreciated it's very clear.
27/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Yes.
27/09/23, 9:07 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes
27/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/09/23, 9:08 pm - +27 78 844 5287: You may move on
27/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 056 8487: You may send sir.
27/09/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
27/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to schedule our session for Friday at 8:30 PM. I hope by that time you might be able to watch the videos.
27/09/23, 9:24 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 👏👏
27/09/23, 9:24 pm - +27 78 844 5287: We will watch them, thank you
27/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Aww
27/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Thank you sir.
29/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Nicole

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you were able to watch the videos so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
29/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Good evening sir. We are all fine thanks and how are you?
29/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Yes we can proceed.
29/09/23, 8:32 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Good evening! We are all fine thank you.
29/09/23, 8:32 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes you may proceed
29/09/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 056 8487: From this video I was inspired by the story of the Billionaire Founder of Computer Systems. It motivated me to try my best in the course I've chosen so that you as my experts will put in a good word for me when the time comes. But the main points were that an Edoofian should be open minded, willing to learn and willing to go the extra mile. And the most important one being to follow instructions.
29/09/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 056 8487: The second video showed me that the Edoofa program is not only aiming to get me in a good university. But to build me into an independent and responsible person. With these qualities, one will have an easy path to success.
29/09/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. Please carry on with the explanation of the videos.
29/09/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 056 8487: The third video is the best. It's not every day you find a scholarship program that puts in so much efforts to secure the future of students. The fact that the Edoofa program took time to walk around schools and find the ones fitting and good enough for their students is not something you hear everyday. This has made me even more excited and proud to be an Edoofian. Even my trust to the program has increased. I've learnt that the program is aiming to prepare it's students both mentally and physically. To have skills of independence. The most important rule to us Edoofians is following instructions.
29/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 056 8487: The the last video is about the Statement of Purpose. From the way I've understood, it's a program that I and any other student that just got enrolled to fill in. The Statement of purpose is given for us to fill out so that we can convince any university or college why we are worthy of admission. The rule when filling it is to trying not to waste time and to be accurate when filling it out.
29/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/09/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
29/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Yes we are on the same page.
29/09/23, 9:01 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes we are still together.
29/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Aren't these the videos you have already sent?
29/09/23, 9:05 pm - +27 78 844 5287: We went through them, u sent these video that Wednesday 27 September 2023
29/09/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the errors; there was a technical error on our end. May I know if you are clear so that we can further proceed with the session?
29/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Yes we can continue.
29/09/23, 9:10 pm - +27 78 844 5287: No problem, thank you
29/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
29/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tuesday 5:30 PM.
29/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

29/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with the SOP, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
29/09/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 056 8487: So I have to submit the Statement of Purpose and the documents required for my university application by Tuesday 5:30pm?
29/09/23, 9:17 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes, that's why they gave you more time to prepare for it.
29/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct. Once you share these documents and complete the tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
29/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 056 8487: I'll be done by Monday.
29/09/23, 9:44 pm - +27 78 844 5287: I support Tuesday before 5.30
29/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In that case, shall we proceed with our session on Tuesday at 5:00 PM, as we have the weekend and Monday marked as a holiday for us?
29/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Okay thank you sir.
29/09/23, 9:47 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much sir.
29/09/23, 9:48 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Enjoy your long weekend.
29/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that we shall connect at the said time. Have a great weekend and my warm regards to your family as well.
29/09/23, 10:05 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 👏👏

03/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 056 8487: I sincerely apologize for the delay.

04/10/23, 5:41 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes you are welcome
04/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/10/23, 5:51 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Very correct information
04/10/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
04/10/23, 6:19 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes you may proceed.
04/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/10/23, 6:22 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you
04/10/23, 6:22 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted
04/10/23, 6:23 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted
04/10/23, 6:26 pm - +27 78 844 5287: It's true, you may kindly please help us to choose since you have a better knowledge of the unniversity.
04/10/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We will absolutely do that for sure.
04/10/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/10/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/10/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/10/23, 6:33 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much.
04/10/23, 6:34 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted
04/10/23, 6:35 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted, will do that sir.
04/10/23, 6:38 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you, Yes it's correct the counsel did explain about it.
04/10/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/10/23, 8:26 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much, We are on the same page.
04/10/23, 8:27 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted with thanks
04/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
04/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
04/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
04/10/23, 8:31 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted, we are together.
04/10/23, 8:32 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 📒
04/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
04/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
04/10/23, 9:21 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted
04/10/23, 9:21 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 👏👏
04/10/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sorry to say that I will not be further available to proceed with our session for now, as unforeseen work has come up that requires my assistance. Let us connect tomorrow evening at 5:00 PM. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/10/23, 9:53 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much. Yes 5pm will be fine for tommorow.
Enjoy your day.
04/10/23, 11:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

I will assist.
09/10/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/10/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
09/10/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/10/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 6:31 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted with thanks
09/10/23, 6:32 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Will do that sir, thank you.
09/10/23, 6:32 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you
09/10/23, 6:34 pm - +27 78 844 5287: I do understood very well with outmost respect, no queries you may proceed sir.
09/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
09/10/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

09/10/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Good evening sir.

I sincerely apologize for not being available. I'm starting my exams next week Tuesday so there's a lot of pressure.
09/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Noted and understood.
09/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 056 8487: I can't wait for my journey as well. This is exciting!
09/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 7:54 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 👏👏
09/10/23, 7:55 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you
09/10/23, 7:56 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted with thanks, yes sir
09/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 8:00 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted
09/10/23, 8:01 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Good news indeed
09/10/23, 8:02 pm - +27 78 844 5287: You may proceed sir, thank you.
09/10/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 8:05 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Great
09/10/23, 8:06 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Good news that's great, we are following.
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 👏👏
09/10/23, 8:08 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 📒
09/10/23, 8:09 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted
09/10/23, 8:10 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted I do understood, the explanation is clearly so
09/10/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 8:22 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted sir
09/10/23, 8:23 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Well understood
09/10/23, 8:24 pm - +27 78 844 5287: But I do have 1 question concerning $150 is that balance from $350 for registration or separate
09/10/23, 8:25 pm - +27 78 844 5287: If says is the balance $150  I will deposit before the 24 th of October sir, I need clarity sir.
09/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is a separate grant that will be provided by Edoofa, applicable only to your registration fees, and it cannot be utilized for other fee structures, please.
09/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 056 8487: So just to make sure I've understood. If the intuition fee is $750. $150 will be paid by the Edoofa grant. So we will pay $600 and Edoofa will pay $150 to make it $750. And this $750 will cover my first semester.

Is it correct?
09/10/23, 8:42 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Clearly understood thank you for that Edoofa
09/10/23, 8:43 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Correct noted sir
09/10/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is partially correct. It will be included in your first year's tuition fees.

For example, if your fees for your first year are $1200, you will be able to reduce $750 (with the Edoofa grant of $150).

Giving you a final total of $450, for your first year. May I know if you are clear here?
09/10/23, 8:46 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Very clearly sir now, noted with thanks.
09/10/23, 8:47 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much sir, now nomore turning back trying to do the outmost to my daughter iwill try all my best for her studies sir.
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You're most welcome! I can sense your dedication and determination to provide the best for your daughter, and that is truly admirable. We're here to support and guide you both every step of the way.
09/10/23, 9:02 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Much appreciated sir for your guidance and supportive.
09/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. and with further continusation.  In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted sir, it's transparency
09/10/23, 9:06 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Ok
09/10/23, 9:09 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Looks like I do understood before 24 oct I will settle the outstanding balance for registration $350 left 150.
So after this I don't mind to pay again 300 for university and 300 out standing to be paid the next month, if it correct we are together sir.
09/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You have grasped the process perfectly! I appreciate your clarity and proactive approach in planning the payments.
09/10/23, 9:13 pm - +27 78 844 5287: No problem I will try to do my best forward we go.
09/10/23, 9:13 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes sir
09/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 9:18 pm - +27 78 844 5287: You may provide with the information sir, thank you
09/10/23, 9:19 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes we don't have the Alevel results yet, they start exams   next Tuesday going forward till November
09/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/10/23, 9:25 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you
09/10/23, 9:26 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 📒
09/10/23, 9:27 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Following
09/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 9:28 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Wishing her best results in Alevel, Noted sir.
09/10/23, 9:29 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Clearly understood
09/10/23, 9:30 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted sir, mouthful words
09/10/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 9:40 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 👏👏
09/10/23, 9:41 pm - +27 78 844 5287: It's clearly said sir.
09/10/23, 9:42 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Very clear with the solution, that's I am wishing her to pass once and for all, but understood very well, in life there is another chance.
09/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes it's clear sir.
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 🗒
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 👏👏
09/10/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 9:50 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted sir
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much for your standard explanation much appreciated sir.
09/10/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 10:01 pm - +27 78 844 5287: It's very clearly sir, no queries with respect sir.
09/10/23, 10:02 pm - +27 78 844 5287: 📒
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - +27 78 844 5287: It's very clearly understandable sir, no queries with respect.
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Nicole's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Nicole is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 10:05 pm - +27 78 844 5287: I am glad to hear that, I am looking forward to the next step to receive an offer letter.
09/10/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Nicole's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
09/10/23, 10:09 pm - +27 78 844 5287: I thank you so much sir, We will patiently waiting for you sir.
09/10/23, 10:10 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you
09/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Thank you sir. We will be waiting to hear from you again.
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nicole.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive.

16/10/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 3:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 3:50 pm - +27 78 844 5287: I can I follow this 1, it's understandable, then  before 28 oct I will deposit 300 and before Nov 300
16/10/23, 3:51 pm - +27 78 844 5287: I'm I right, sorry to bother you but need to understand the right thing iam suppose to do
16/10/23, 4:02 pm - +27 78 844 5287: My apology to my understanding I have to pay 150 before 24 October.
300 before 28 October
300 before 28 November.
If this correct we are on the same page I will do that.
16/10/23, 4:28 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Are we still together my leaders
16/10/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is very correct! Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 4:31 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted with thanks, be blessed for your patience.
16/10/23, 4:32 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes I need your help interms of paying the money.
My daughter stays in Zimbabwe in Harare capital city.
16/10/23, 4:33 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Myself in South Africa Northwest province in Mafikeng 187 Lonely park
16/10/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 4:35 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much will do so before the end of this month.
16/10/23, 4:35 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes I know the place
16/10/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
16/10/23, 4:37 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Is it fine to use Mr Rajan s account for the outstanding 150 and 300 for  University
16/10/23, 4:39 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Also do you have another Alternatively account if I want to deposit the money in South Africa, if you have just give I will choose the easiest
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 056 8487: I'm so happy. Thank you so much for all the hard work you have put to get me in such a good university!
16/10/23, 6:04 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Are we still together
17/10/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, if you wish to make the payment from South Africa, you can make it through Mama Money as well, may I know if you are aware of the same?
17/10/23, 3:01 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Good afternoon, May you please assist me how do I use mama money I do have that account
17/10/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, once you are ready to make the payment of the registration fee, you can let us know and I will get the Mama Money Order generated for you to be able to make the payment. Is that clear?
17/10/23, 3:10 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much iwill do that next week.
17/10/23, 3:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
17/10/23, 3:19 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Great, it's very Clear.
I thank you.
17/10/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/10/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/10/23, 3:21 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you that's good.
17/10/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
17/10/23, 3:21 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Yes very clear
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Noted with thanks.
17/10/23, 3:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - +27 78 844 5287: I thank you very well, now it's very clearly though yesterday I was struggling to understand but now clearly, I thank you for the communication and clarity.
I will do the payments before the 28 oct and the last one November.
I appreciate your patience.
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

22/10/23, 12:32 am - +263 78 056 8487: Good morning sir. I hope you are doing well. My mother is currently having finance issues. Things are really tough. And unfortunately she won't be able to pay the enrollment fee of $300 in time. As of now we are in a crisis and can't raise the money as of now.

23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note Nicole, I wanted to discuss the same with your mother here during our discussion that. However, at that time, your mother has mentioned that she will manage to raise the fee in time and complete the admission process. Now, about that, can you please let me know if your mother is also available to discuss the same with me here?
23/10/23, 10:26 am - +27 78 844 5287: Good morning sir, Hope you are all doing well.

What you are saying is true but the grace of time it's short, truely for now I don't have money, that's why we requested to you to give more time  to find money.

Also you promised that you will help but you never tell us how still pending, myself I tried to be onest with you.
I was thinking that registration it's for next year like as many universities I know.

My sincerely apology for misunderstanding but for now I don't have I tried to be transparency to you but still looks like it's not working for us.

If you may give us end Nov the last balance first January truely  and to be onest I don't have money.

Hope this find you inorder.
23/10/23, 11:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. However, I'd like to bring up that we have previously discussed this matter, and during our earlier conversation, there was an indication that you would manage to raise the fee in time. However, it's clear that the timeline has become a concern now, and I appreciate you letting us know about your current situation.

But on that note, I would require you to be more clear on the matter of preparations and the plans to complete the admission process, only then will I be able to help you please.
23/10/23, 11:07 am - +27 78 844 5287: Noted,I will try my best only that for now I don't have.
Yes for admission I said it but I thought it's early next year not this yr due for 15 day.
I am trying my best to Pay as I promise but for now still  not sleeping thinking whom can help to pay the Registration.
23/10/23, 11:13 am - Milan Edoofa: I truly appreciate your honesty and your commitment to providing the best opportunities for Nicole's education. While the timeline is indeed approaching quickly, rest assured that we're here to support you in finding a solution.

Since you have mentioned you don't have the funds available at the moment, I'd like to explore some potential options that may help us work through this situation together.
23/10/23, 11:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Firstly, could you let me know if there are any friends or family members who may be in a position to provide some temporary assistance in raising the required funds for Nicole's registration? Sometimes, a collective effort can go a long way.
23/10/23, 11:52 am - +27 78 844 5287: Unfortunately I don't have both parents since 2003.
I father was the only son and had four girls and I am the second 1 others  they are also struggling with the money too.
And on side of Nicole s father apparently they never  took took of herself and it's only the grandfather and he is not working he aged.
So  our family never grew because we are only girls and my father was the only 1.
First born and third there are not working it's me and the last 1 but you no Zimbabwe she is the 1 paying Nicole fees so she was promising to buy her few clothes for next year
23/10/23, 11:53 am - +27 78 844 5287: Truely said 🥲
23/10/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about your family's financial challenges, and I understand that this situation is complex. Given the circumstances, we need to consider all possible options to help Nicole secure her future. On that note, I would also like to mention that if you are finding it hard to pay all the registration fee at once, we can also discuss an alternate payment plan, do you wish to do that?
23/10/23, 1:05 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much for that
23/10/23, 1:05 pm - +27 78 844 5287: I think it's better to make a alternate payment and I will try best.
23/10/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: You're welcome, and I appreciate your willingness to explore alternative options. Let's discuss an alternate payment plan. To make it more manageable, we can break down the $300 registration fee into smaller installments. What amount do you think you can comfortably pay within the next few days before the deadline please?
23/10/23, 1:32 pm - +27 78 844 5287: I think 150 it's fine, I will try the best I can

I truly understand the strain you're under, especially with the responsibilities you're shouldering. It's commendable how much you're doing for your family despite the financial challenges. Your commitment to your child's education is truly admirable. How ever paying the university by us will not be possible and  hence I would like to ask how much were able to gather for the second payment?

I hope this message finds you well. Your commitment to supporting Nicole's education is truly commendable, and I understand the financial challenges you're facing.

Your dedication to making payments towards Nicole's university education is sincerely appreciated. However, considering the time frame, it will be very tight, and you might end up losing out on your offer letter. To avoid that, shall we discuss a payment plan for the month of December?

My finances they are not meeting my points, Nicole she is not the only child, so hey its tough it's about paying fees but now it's a problem to pay monthly fee for Nicole because my money is little.

09/12/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nicole.

I hope this message reaches you in good health. *I am Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Please excuse Mr. Shivjeet for his unavailability this week, as he is engaged in meetings with university officials. He will be available again after the 15th of December. In the meantime, I am here to assist you with any concerns or questions you may have.
09/12/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Regarding your request for a refund, I regret to inform you that a refund is not feasible. Let me explain the policy for clarity: a refund is only possible if we, as an organization, fail to provide Nicole with an offer letter. Since this condition does not apply in this case, a refund cannot be issued.

However, I noticed that you mentioned an inability to make the payment for Nicole's fees, leading to your request for a refund. Could you please share about the particular challenges you faced in this regard? Understanding your situation better would allow me to provide the most appropriate assistance.
09/12/23, 1:11 pm - +27 78 844 5287: My problem is financial, I can't afford to pay it, yes for registration you may take the money, what about the for university iam really struggling may you please return atlist some funds😭😭😭
09/12/23, 1:12 pm - +27 78 844 5287: For me not to continue to pay is that I am struggling with money.
09/12/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern with me, I understand. However, let me help you understand that the registration fee is to reserve a scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.
09/12/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The payment you've made is towards the university fee only to secure Nicole's seat. I understand you're facing financial difficulties, so could you please provide more details about your specific financial challenges? This information is crucial for me to offer you the most suitable solution. As per the refund policy, you are not eligible for a refund, hence understanding your situation in more detail will help me explore how best to support Nicole's higher education aspirations. For this, a transparent discussion about your challenges is necessary.
09/12/23, 3:09 pm - +27 78 844 5287: For now iam speechless my problem is finances I thought I will try but failing, and I was thinking that Edoofa is a scholarship not knowing I pay more on that money, I was wishing Nicole to study but iam failing true
10/12/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Good evening Ms. Kirti. 

So is the registration fee for the university not refundable?
11/12/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Nicole.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded on Saturday, it was past my working hours, so I was unable to respond to you. However, I was able to go through the message you shared above, and I completely understand that you have financial challenges rest assured I am here to help you walk through that same challenge. If you are facing any concerns there would obviously be a solution to it as well. But before we discuss this solution you know you mentioned that you were looking forward to the Edoofa Scholarship program but now you feel that you are supposed to make the payment hence I would like you to please elaborate a bit. May I also know when you enrolled in the Edoofa scholarship program were you not aware of the cost involved for Nicole's higher education abroad?
11/12/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can respond to the same by tomorrow since my available hours are almost over so I will not be able to continue with our discussion hence let us reconnect tomorrow after you have shared your thoughts on the above message. Have a great night ahead. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 11:53 am - +27 78 844 5287: Good morning? Hope you are doing well.

I was so willing Nicole to proceed with her studies but I am failing to pay because of money.

When Nicole explained at first I thought Edoofa is a scholarship helping with the University fees only that is a certain amount.

I was only aware when you were explaining but looks like the whole amount it's me paying it, so problem is the money, I would love her to study but money is a problem to me, for me to pay registration and University I struggle for it sir,
12/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 056 8487: My mother wants to proceed but she doesn't have the money currently.

And yes she knew about the about the costs involved with the higher education. She was willing and eager to meet the demands but unfortunately it didn't go well.
12/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Good afternoon Ms. Kirti. 

So is the registration fee for the university not refundable?
12/12/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening and Nicole,

I hope this message finds you all in good health. Thank you for your kind inquiries; I'm doing well, and I appreciate you sharing the challenges you're facing.

I'd like to gently remind you that when Nicole's counseling sessions began, our counselors provided a comprehensive breakdown of all the costs involved. This is why we emphasize the importance of parents being added to our group, to ensure they are fully informed about the expenses. I recall that you were present in the group discussions, and at that time, you indicated your understanding of the financial requirements before we initiated Nicole's application process. There were no concerns raised by you at that stage.
12/12/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Similarly, when we presented the offer letter, there was no mention of financial concerns during our conversations, and you proceeded with paying Nicole's registration fee some part. While I completely empathize with financial constraints, I'm trying to understand what has changed suddenly. As mentioned above by @263780568487 you seemed prepared and willing to meet the financial requirements earlier. Could you please share what unexpected challenges have arisen now that are impacting your ability to fulfill these commitments? Your insights will help me understand your situation better and explore how we might be able to assist further.
12/12/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 056 8487: My mother is a teacher. She's currently the only working parent. And she was willing and eager to meet the higher education's demands. But along the way my mother neglected a few of her duties while trying to put me first. She even went to the extent of borrowing money from family and friends which needs to be returned. I'm not happy about the stress my mother is facing so I just decided to pull out from the scholarship program. Not because I don't want it anymore but because it's not worth seeing my mother under so much stress. Because currently she only has R500 in her bank and she's currently at home since schools closed. And yes, when we started the program everything was clearly explained and we clearly understood. We just didn't expect things to not go our way. We sincerely apologies.

From a professional level I know my reason is not convincing enough. But that's the truth.
12/12/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your particular concern with me Nicole, I have taken note of it as well however, as it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
12/12/23, 10:13 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Alright. We will try to be available tomorrow.
13/12/23, 8:49 am - +27 78 844 5287: 👏👏
13/12/23, 8:49 am - +27 78 844 5287: Morning
13/12/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Nicole,

I hope this message finds you in good health. I wanted to follow up on the message I sent earlier. With that in mind, I am reaching out to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us, so we can proceed with our ongoing discussion?
13/12/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Good evening ma'am. Yes we are available.
13/12/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Thank you for sharing your situation so openly. It's evident that your mother, as a teacher and the sole working parent, has been incredibly dedicated to supporting your higher education aspirations. Her willingness to prioritize your needs is commendable and I understand your concerns and the pressure you're feeling regarding the scholarship process. It's important to recognize that this is something many parents experience, as scholarship seats and opportunities are highly competitive. Currently, 304 students from Zimbabwe have already secured their seats. If we wait until all results are out, there's a risk that no seats will be available, potentially affecting your opportunity for higher education.
13/12/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the current economic situation in Zimbabwe, the challenges your parents are experiencing now could be a part of your life in the next 10 years if you stay there. On the other hand, if you secure your admission, perform consistently in the EWYL program, and complete your education in India, your future could be considerably brighter.
13/12/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: India is renowned for its education and specifically health sector and upon returning to Zimbabwe, you could easily find a job earning $1000 to $1500 per month. However, if you decide to work in India, your growth potential is even greater. In India, a fresher's basic salary is typically $5000 to $6000 per year, and this presents a significant opportunity for your career to flourish. With such an opportunity, you will not only be in a better position but also in a position to support your family effectively.
13/12/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I suggest you consider the long-term perspective and not just the immediate challenges as your admission officer. While the next 5-6 months might be challenging, it's a small sacrifice for your future growth and the opportunity to provide a better life for your family challenges are part of a life Nicole, however, have you considered that investing in Education will never go wrong, I would love to share you my experience as well, however, you can share your thought process of the above messages and we will connect tomorrow and I would love to share my experience as well with you. I hope you will be available, have a great night, and do convey my regards to your family rest assured we will figure out a solution with the regular and transparent discussions.
13/12/23, 10:14 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Yes. I know that the scholarship will be of great help for my future.

But how do we solve the financial issue we are currently facing. Because I think it was somehow mentioned that delaying the registration fee might make me risk my seat in the university.
13/12/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I understand that financial challenges can be a concern and as I mentioned rest assured being your admission officer I am committed to assisting you. And after our discussion tomorrow, we will figure out a solution for your challenges as well. I hope you will be available, have a great night, and do convey my regards to your family.
13/12/23, 10:29 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Okay thank you.
14/12/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nicole. 

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, I wanted to reach out and check if you are available to connect with us so that we can continue with our discussion?
14/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Good afternoon ma'am. 

Yes we are available.
14/12/23, 3:58 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Good afternoon ma'am, yes we are available
14/12/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings kindly excuse me for not connecting at that time, I was occupied with a meeting which was then accompanied by my dinner break, hence I was not able to get back to you, may I know if we can connect now?
14/12/23, 6:09 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Afternoon ma'am, yes you may start
14/12/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm pleased that we can resume our discussion. Reflecting on our conversation from yesterday, I hope the significance of Nicole registering with the university is clearer now. While I fully acknowledge that financial challenges can be daunting, there are always ways to overcome these obstacles.
14/12/23, 6:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Like many, I didn't come from an affluent background. My parents, understanding the value of education, faced their own financial struggles to ensure I could pursue higher education. They took out an educational loan for my graduation, a decision that has paid off as I am now in a stable position, able to support them and provide the lifestyle they had hoped for. It brings me immense joy to be able to give back to my parents, who made investment for my education.
14/12/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe Nicole likely shares a similar aspiration – to create a better future for herself and eventually give back to those who supported her journey. Education is a powerful tool for change and progress, and it's heartening to see you are willing to invest in your children's future, despite the challenges.
14/12/23, 6:29 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much for the word of encouragement, yes Educational is the key to open everything and Noone will take it from you.

But the problem iam working in South Africa at private school and they don't allow loan because  I am using passport not ID that my stress like others they do have opportunity unfortunately truely speaking I don't qualify for loan
14/12/23, 6:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that these challenges can be a hurdle because I went through the same once, and being your admission officer I am committed to assisting you in all the challenges that you have and guide throughout the process. I will have a discussion with the academic board personally and present a strong case for you since I understand your concern and to help you here by discussing your case with them as well, to do that could you help me understand how much will you be able to raise before 30th of December, this will help me to understand your situation?
14/12/23, 6:36 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Iam trying my best for Nicole but to be onest I failed that's why I don't want promises, I know it's pains her but money it's a problem I am working at private school
14/12/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that @27788445287 however, for me to assist you and to have a discussion regarding Nicole's case I would need to present a strong case as well, to do that you would need to help me understand how much will be you be able to raise before or by 30th of December. I am here willing to take a extra step for her and I will need your support as well.
14/12/23, 6:42 pm - +27 78 844 5287: For now it's too much for me ma'am, if you may help I will try to return it small small, May you please assist Nicole, I am humbling saying
14/12/23, 6:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now I understand the challenges that you as a parent are facing and for me to help you here by discussing your case with the academic board as well, I suggest here you make the deposit of $147 before or by the 30th of December and pay the next $147 on the 30th of January 2024, and the remaining $147 on the 30th February 2024.

May I know if this will help you to ease your burden?

14/12/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely you can take your time to discuss this with the family and you can update me tomorrow, I shall wait for your update.
