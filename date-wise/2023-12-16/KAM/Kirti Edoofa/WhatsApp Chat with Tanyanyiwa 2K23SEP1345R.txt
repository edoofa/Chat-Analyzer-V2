I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
21/09/23, 10:25 pm - +263 77 634 0475: We are ready
21/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 634 0475: I am done.You can. explain
21/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
21/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 634 0475: The steps are clear
21/09/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
21/09/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
21/09/23, 10:43 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Yes  l am following
21/09/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
21/09/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?

26/09/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanyanyiwa.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, I am doing great and I am glad to know that you have successfully gone through the videos, could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos with us?
26/09/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 344 2930: We understood that the Edoofa program is genuine and that students should be cooperative and try to meet the deadlines.We also understood that a form is going to be sent to us which we will fill as soon as we receive it.Students who are enrolled through the program will receive quality education in India and chances of them getting employed in India are very high.The Earn While You Learn imparts a lot of skills in the students.We also learnt about schools,colleges and universities under the Edoofa program.The student is also supposed to prepare a Statement of Purpose to convince the admission officials why he or she should be enrolled
26/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 344 2930: We also learnt that step5 is the university interaction
26/09/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
26/09/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
26/09/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
26/09/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
26/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you very much for the clarifications
26/09/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
26/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you so much.Yes we are on the same page
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
26/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

26/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 344 2930: My question is that Tariro is in boarding school and has no access to a cell phone.Can we do it on her behalf
26/09/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For this Step, we would require Tariro's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
26/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 344 2930: It's fine thank you
26/09/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So can I anticipate that you will be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by tomorrow at 01.30 pm as per Tariro's input?
26/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Yes we will do so

26/09/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is ____ and he/she has scheduled my session for ___ *(mention the date)
26/09/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Noted thank you
26/09/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Thanx will definately do that
26/09/23, 5:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

27/09/23, 3:27 am - +263 77 344 2930: 2.Diping vibrations are defined as movement that occurs as a result of fluid passing through the piping system.The first cause of gas pipeline vibration 20 carbon steel lime is high frequency vibrations due to high pressure.This excitation at a point on surface produces waves that propagate laterally throughout the material.Secondly motion characterised by chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity in short turbulences and pressure fluctuations.The third cause are external factors that include nearby construction, wind and earthquakes.Improperly done installations or maintenance of pipelines and the flow of gas itself leads to vibrations.Another cause is heavy pressure drop leading to Cavitation.Equipment that is part of the piping like compressor and pumps as they rotate and reciprocate produce mechanical forces or excitation forces.Lastly corrosion and damage to the pipeline lead to gas pipeline vibration 20 carbon steel lines.Internal corrosion occurs when there is an electrolyte to make the corrosion cell complete.In gas pipelines natural gas may contain tiny amounts of contaminants.For example carbon, water and hydrogen sulphide.Given that water condenses there is a formation of acid with hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide leading to corrosion.

27/09/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I shall wait for your response.

27/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 634 0475: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate Tanyanyiwa's response and will be proceeding to work on them so that her university application is well prepared.
27/09/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
27/09/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before moving ahead I would like to enquire if you were able to join the EWYL group and connect with the EWYL mentor?
27/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Good afternoon.We were able to join the EWYL group
27/09/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is ____ and he/she has scheduled my session for ___ *(mention the date)
27/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you.We will do so
27/09/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe Tanyanyiwa wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Technology in Chemical Engineering for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
27/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Yes that is correct
27/09/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Definitely we are ready to start that
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/09/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 634 0475: We able to join the group but not connected with the mentor
27/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Yes we understand that
27/09/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you very much.Yes our counselor told us about the registration fee during our counseling sessions
27/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2700 to $3700 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
27/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you.We are on the same page
27/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
27/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you we have  taken note of the fee break up
27/09/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $3600 as per the above example.
27/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $3600 - $750 = $2850. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1425 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1425 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you so much
27/09/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/09/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/09/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Noted thank you very much
27/09/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 344 2930: My question is at which stage is the registration fee which ranges from $500 to $750 supposed to be paid?
27/09/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand, the registration fee is required to be paid when the university has generated the offer letter, and let me also tell you that the fee of $500 to $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first tear cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
27/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you very much.I am clear now
28/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Hello Admission Officer, l am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor.The name of my mentor is Ms Anya and she has scheduled my session for 29 September 2023

28/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 344 2930: We have reviewed the benefits thank you
28/09/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with our discussion ahead, however, it is past our available working hours, so let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm to continue with the discussion.
28/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 634 0475: It's ok
30/09/23, 11:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tanyanyiwa.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Afternoon.we are now available
05/10/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tanyanyiwa.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence and not connecting with you, as I have been under the weather though I look forward to connecting with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Good afternoon we are available
05/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 344 2930: We hope you are feeling better now
05/10/23, 2:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, I am doing better now. It is great to know you are available. So may I know if you are ready to start with the discussion?
05/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Yes we are ready
05/10/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263773442930 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 344 2930: This is amazing thank you
05/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Yes it resonates with us
05/10/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you we appreciate it
05/10/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you
05/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 344 2930: May you kindly explain the process
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
05/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you we have understood that
05/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Yes that's right
05/10/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Yes I agree
05/10/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 344 2930: I have got a question.After receiving the offer letter how many days are we given to make the payment
05/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 344 2930: I am clear with this one
05/10/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After receiving the offer letter 15 days time is given to pay the first half of the registration fee as explained above. 

I hope we are clear here?
05/10/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Ok I understand now
05/10/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you I am clear on this one
05/10/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Yes it's clear
05/10/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Giving up on education is not an option
05/10/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 344 2930: I don't have any queries  I now understand everything
05/10/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Tanyanyiwa's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Tanyanyiwa is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Yes definitely I am excited as a parent and raring to go
05/10/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Do the universities send the offer letters directly to us or they are sent to you and then you forward them to us?
05/10/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: They will be sharing a mail as well, however, if we receive the letter first we shall share it with you here.
05/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 344 2930: That is wonderful thank you very much.We want our daughter Tariro to succeed academically and try her luck abroad.Here in Zimbabwe we are stuck in an economic crisis of unprecedented levels
05/10/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, please do not worry we want the best for Tariro too.
05/10/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 344 2930: All your efforts are greatly appreciated
05/10/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words @263773442930
05/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 344 2930: You are welcome
02/11/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tanyanyiwa,

03/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you very much
03/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you again.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Yes we have gone through the letter
03/11/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University. I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well.
03/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the registration fee?
03/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 634 0475: 1.$1225
2.4years
3.$200
3.$700
03/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. I hope you are clear about this?
03/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 634 0475: We are clear about that
03/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, now, let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation available at LPU.
03/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
03/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
03/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 634 0475: So  the off campus accommodation is affordable provided it's safe for the  students
03/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Off campus accommodations are they closer to the university so that no transport fee is required
03/11/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
03/11/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options. Most of the off-campus accommodations are within walking distance of the university. 

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
03/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 634 0475: As for you which one is the bset
03/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Accommodation is payable monthly or per semester or annually?
03/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, and I will get back to it please do not worry, however, I want you to note all your queries so that we can discuss them at the end after we are done with the letter discussion so that we do not mix our concerns.
03/11/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 634 0475: This message was deleted
03/11/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Thank you

I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 08:30 a.m. I hope you will be available. Wish you a blessed night ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!

04/11/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 344 2930: Our calculations show that it is convenient for us to pay the amount using Mr Charles account.So we will do so early this week and send you the proof of payment
04/11/23, 11:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.
04/11/23, 11:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
04/11/23, 11:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
04/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Yes we are very clear.Thank you very much.EWYL is good for the student
04/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
04/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 344 2930: We do not have any queries.Everything is clear to us now
04/11/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -

LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
04/11/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

04/11/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them on Monday and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
04/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 344 2930: Thank you so much

06/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Lovely Professional University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from LPU as a collective?
06/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Definately .we had an opportunity to discuss as a family.
06/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
06/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 634 0475: They were very happy about Tariro's great opportunity to study in lndia.As a family we were delighted on seeing our daughter's dreams come true.They also give thumbs up to Edoofa for that great opportunity.Thanx to you our counsellorsfor the great guidance towards Tariro 's success.
06/11/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and thank you for your kind words. I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
06/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 634 0475: I have a question on  On Campus Accommodation.It said per annum accommodation for standard  4 seater air cooler is 1125.ls it the maximum price or we can  get something less depending on the size of accommodation
06/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, let me help you understand. Yes, please it will be the maximum price and this price is the annual price which includes food as well. However, since this is expensive for most of our students almost all of the students chose to stay off campus, since it is more affordable, the student has the freedom to cook for themselves as well. In on-campus accommodation you will not have the freedom to cook all your meals since there will be a university mess that provides food.
06/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 634 0475: Thanx for the clarification
06/11/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome,  may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
06/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 634 0475: We managed to research about it.We were happy to find out it is the best I India and also globally recogised due its excellency
06/11/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed LPU is one of the best universities which is globally recognized. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
06/11/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
