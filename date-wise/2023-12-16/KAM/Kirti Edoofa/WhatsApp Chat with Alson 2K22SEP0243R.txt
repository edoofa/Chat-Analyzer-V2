12/09/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Alson,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Alson’s higher education?
11/10/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Alson.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to get in touch with you and express my understanding regarding the difficulties you've been facing recently, which have led to your absence.

Over the last few months, I've been anticipating your response and observed that you haven't been able to engage with us. May I know if you are facing any challenges @263780145427 ?
14/10/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alson.

I trust you are doing well. I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but unfortunately, I didn't hear back. I did, however, notice that you had the opportunity to review my message. Could you please confirm if we are still connected?
18/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alson

I hope this message finds you well. I am Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa. In the past few days, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end.

We acknowledge that you have been able to notice the messages that we share however, I think there might be underlying reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing your absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.
18/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program in 20222, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024. Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage.
18/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged us to reach out once more, extending an opportunity for you to openly discuss your concerns, which have been hindering your communication with the team. Our aim is to address these issues and provide you with the necessary guidance and solutions. Your participation is vital in ensuring your continued progress in this journey @263780145427.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
28/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes l am available

28/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes l do
28/11/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?

28/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is  B.Sc (Chemistry) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 014 5427: correct
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 014 5427: noted
28/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes that $200 right
28/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 014 5427: so am l going to pay for  the rest  when lm in India since l paid the 200 ?
28/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Please clarify for me
28/11/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780145427 I believe you are confused right now and what you are referring to is the Edoofa program fee of $350, this $750 is the registration fee, it is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
28/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Clear now so l will also have to finish the edoofa program fee
28/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 014 5427: right
28/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780145427 yes please that is something your counselor will be able to help you understand better, however, the $750 is the registration fee which will ensure your seat with the university.
28/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay madam noted
28/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now since we will not be available to continue with our discussion let us reconnect tomorrow during the day time which is at 12:30 pm. Have a great evening ahead.
28/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 014 5427: thank you good night
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alson.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 014 5427: l am available now
29/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 014 5427: good afternoon
29/11/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
29/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes indeed
29/11/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes
29/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
29/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 014 5427: What about the 750 its not in the total
29/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 014 5427: you said its not an additional fee if lm got right . so is it in the tuition fee of 1800 or ………….?
29/11/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let me help you understand. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
29/11/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 014 5427: understood now
29/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay okay
29/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 014 5427: how much roughly can the visas and flight cost
29/11/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself. The tickets are to be booked after one gets their visa from the embassy and the visa cost will be $83.
29/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay thank you
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes indeed
29/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 014 5427: wooooow nice
29/11/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It was a pleasure to meet them in person, I hope you are excited to be in this picture for next batch?
29/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 014 5427: looking forward to it
29/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me it was my dinner break so I was not able to get back to you. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
29/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes thank you
29/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
29/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

29/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
29/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 014 5427: am finished
29/11/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/11/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
29/11/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
29/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 014 5427: that's great
29/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you earlier, as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over let us reconnect tomorrow for our discussion, please. Have  a blessed night.
29/11/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 014 5427: thank you blessed night to you too
30/11/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 014 5427: GOOD MORNING
30/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alson.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 375 1826: Afternoon yes we can thank you
30/11/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
30/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes we can connect
30/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 014 5427: clear
30/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yees
30/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
30/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes yes
30/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 10, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 014 5427: no all clear
30/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 014 5427: please  do provide me with more
30/11/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
30/11/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
30/11/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/11/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
30/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes clear
30/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 014 5427: right so inorder to have a 50% or more scholarship I should have 6 and above points right or....
30/11/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780145427 to have a 50% scholarship you should have at least 2E passing points. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
30/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay clear
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please now, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 014 5427: I agree
30/11/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/11/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 014 5427: clear
30/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
30/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes
30/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay
30/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 345 2107: Okay
30/11/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 014 5427: no l don't
30/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
30/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 014 5427: yes maam
30/11/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
30/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay good day Ms Kirti thank you
30/11/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great day to you too!
30/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 014 5427: NAMASTEY 😁
30/11/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Namastey and I am so happy to see you learning new words. 🙏🏻
01/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 014 5427: yes GOOD MORNING

07/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 014 5427: how much roughly must we arrange for that amount for the university  you said must be paid whilst lm in zim
07/12/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand since your registration fee ranges from $500-$750, I would suggest you prepare for the higher amount which is $750, so that even if the full amount is not utilized it can be used in your process ahead or you can safe from the same right?
07/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay thank you
07/12/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great day ahead!

I hope you are doing well and had a fruitful weekend, may I know if you wish to share any thoughts of concerns with me?
11/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 014 5427: how long does it normally take for the universities
11/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 014 5427: to reply
11/12/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern. It depends upon the number of applications the university is evaluating. The universities are taking time and the delay is from their end since more than 300 students have submitted their applications for the Endowment as you recall only 37 seats were left, so the university Is taking time to evaluate the applciation.
11/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 014 5427: okay
11/12/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Have a great day ahead!

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

15/12/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Alson,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/12/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 375 1826: Okay yes
15/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Okay
15/12/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/12/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Noted with thanks
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Yes it does
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 014 5427: 1) 900
2)3 years (6 semesters)
3)300
4) 750
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Yes clear
15/12/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/12/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/12/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/12/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 014 5427: By going independently you mean look for accommodation on my own or .,...?
15/12/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Allow me to clarify for you, Alson. When I mention going independently, I'm referring to the option, like other Edoofians, of choosing to live off-campus. But rest assured, you won't be left to find accommodation by yourself. We will provide assistance here as well once you arrive in India.
15/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Okay
15/12/23, 6:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
15/12/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Yes it does
15/12/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Clear
15/12/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/12/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/12/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 014 5427: So when is the 300 due
15/12/23, 7:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780145427 the $300 which is the admission process fee has been waived off. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Yes please do
15/12/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Yes yes just to be clear this amount will be part of the fees right if l got it right ?
15/12/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes you are correct here Alson. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/12/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/12/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Yes l do stay in zimbabwe
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/12/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 014 5427: What about the mode  l used to pay for that Edoofa fee , we transfered into the given account is it still valid
15/12/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

15/12/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/12/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Okay so 4000 when on campus
15/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Per year
15/12/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please which is very expensive for our students, and hence our students prefer the off-campus since it has all the facilities of an on-campus accommodation along with the freedom to cook for themselves as well if you want. I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
15/12/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
15/12/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Yes very safe
15/12/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/12/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/12/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/12/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Yes understood
15/12/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/12/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/12/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/12/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Yes very advantageous
15/12/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/12/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/12/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/12/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 014 5427: Yeah as of now you left no stone unturned maybe with time l will be asking but now no
15/12/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
