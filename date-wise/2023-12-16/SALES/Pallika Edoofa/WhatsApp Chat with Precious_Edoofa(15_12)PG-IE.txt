15/12/23, 12:54 pm - +265 999 18 10 62: Thank you very much
15/12/23, 12:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is a pleasure connecting with you, Mrs. Phiri.
15/12/23, 12:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Phiri, Please note that I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
15/12/23, 1:11 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: I purposely picked Edoofa Scholarship to pursue my bachelor’s degree in medical Laboratory Sciences/Technology because I found it to be one of the best  in that field after my own research. I am also attracted by the diversity as the program draws students from different countries and backgrounds across the globe hence this would enrich and widen my view of life and help me gain skills and knowledge that are not available in my country.This would also improve my academic and career network as I would interact with so many different people. I am also attracted by the programs *earn while you learn* strategy through international internships which would also boost my skills and knowledge and experience in my field study and would put me at an advantage in the work sector. Edoofa’s vision of affordability accessibility and employability of education also motivates to be able to give back to my country through the skills and knowledge I will acquire through my education. Lastly I am highly motivated to apply for edoofa scholarship due to the financial difficulties that my family has been facing which has left my parents in a state of despair for my tertiary studies hence being awarded this scholarship would help reduce the financial burden on my family.
15/12/23, 1:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Precious, Thank you for sharing about this thoroughly, and also I can see you are well-motivated. Please let me add more information to it.
15/12/23, 1:19 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: My understanding of the program as per the discussion I had with Jonathan is that firstly, this is a program aims at helping capable students overcome financial and academic barriers that prevent them from achieving their goals in life . Secondly the program has so many benefits as it is a work-study program and does on largely focus on theoretical aspects rather it follows practical approach .I also learned that the earn-while you learn program offered by edoofa helps students to also reduce their academic costs. Edoofa also enrolls students from over 50 countries hence students are exposed to diversity hence everyone interested should feel free to apply for the program. Thank you
15/12/23, 1:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/12/23, 1:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, several schools, educators, and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.


*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*
15/12/23, 1:33 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: It is my pleasure
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - +265 999 18 10 62: First of all  I would like to express my gratitude for consideration my son, Precious for this scholarship program. As a family we are very grateful for this and hope for nothing but success.
As I believe you are already aware, my name is Mrs Phiri. As Precious’ mother I am self employed as a second-hand clothing salesperson at Nsungwi market in Lilongwe. Unfortunately I did not go that far with my studies as I dropped out after completing my high school with a Malawi School Certificate of Education (MSCE) due to financial and other issues within my family that were beyond my control. Despite not completing my studies I am well aware that as parents, it is our responsibility to provide the best support for our child’s academic journey hence we have worked our best throughout his journey to this stage. But it pains us that our current financial status has left us disadvantaged in meeting our child’s academic costs. We fully respect the fact that education is key in shaping one’s career hence we  do not want our child to stop where we stopped but they should rather be able to do better than us. However it breaks our hearts that we could be hindering his education.
15/12/23, 1:36 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Yes . I am highly looking forward to such an opportunity
15/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Phiri, Thank you for your heartfelt message and for entrusting us with Precious's scholarship application. We understand and appreciate the sacrifices you've made to support his academic journey. Your dedication to providing the best for Precious despite financial challenges is commendable. We acknowledge your aspirations for his education and share your commitment to ensuring he can pursue his studies without hindrance.
15/12/23, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!

15/12/23, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Phiri, As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
15/12/23, 2:23 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: I am an 18 year old high school graduate born in a family of  two boys and a girl in which I am the first born child.I have spent most part of my childhood life in Dowa, T/A Dzoole where my parents were mostly living on farming and selling of Kachasu( locally brewed beer). As a child, life was miserable in Dowa as my parents were at their lowest financially hence we could go a day without a meal and sometimes just have a single day’s meal. Despite being at their low, my parents always tried their best not to expose their insecurities and burdens to us by making sure we still accessed some of the basic needs fellow kids had though as a first born child I could see it clearly that things were not in place. During this time I  was not going to school rather helping out with the work. Things went on like this until 2012 when life took a different path when my father secured a job as a Chauffeur in the ministry of foreign affairs. This meant that we had to move to Lilongwe, the capital city where I got the privilege of high quality education as I started my primary school education at Cherub Private School. After my Primary School Leaving examination in which I manage to get 5 distinctions and one B, I was selected to go to Marist Secondary School for my high school education. Things were moving fine until my father was switched from ministry of foreign affairs to Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DODMA) where he got a very low salary compared to the one in his previous job. This made it difficult to pay for my school fees as I now also had two siblings in primary school. However with the support of my mother’s business they managed to support my high school studies until I wrote my final high school examinations, the Malawi School Certificate of Education in which I managed to score 7 distinctions. Therefore I can say with much delight that my family has been the number one force of my motivation to aim higher in life. Thank you.

I can say that I have so many strengths but the most notable ones include that firstly, once given a task, I focus on completing that task. Secondly, I am a good team worker with good leadership and communication skills which is evident by my roles in high school. However I believe no man is flawless hence some of my weaknesses are that once given a group task and my teammates are not cooperating while we have approached the deadline I tend to finish the task on my own and I am not tolerant to noisy environment when studying.

During my free time I enjoy playing soccer, watching movies , reading fictional true stories and lastly listening to music .
15/12/23, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Precious, Thank you for sharing your remarkable journey and the resilience demonstrated by your family. Your perseverance and dedication to education, despite facing significant challenges, are truly inspiring. We acknowledge the role your family has played as a driving force in your motivation to achieve academic success. Your story reflects strength, determination, and the transformative power of education.

So do you have any past experiences or learnings in this field specifically?
15/12/23, 2:44 pm - +265 999 18 10 62: As parents, we have put in place so many plans for our child to access the best opportunities. For instance we have tried contacting some institutions that offer student loans so that our child can get a loan to complete his studies since being the first born child , all his siblings look up to him hence it would motivate them too to see their big brother excel. Unfortunately we missed the application window for this years student loans by the HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT LOANS AND GRANTS BOARD, as we got the information late which has left us stressed on the next step to take since our jobs can not fully cover the tuition fees . The country’s devaluation of currency has also added to the burden as school fees has been raised in all the universities in the country . But we are still putting in effort by saving up our earnings to support our child
15/12/23, 2:45 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: No I do not have any past experiences or learnings in this field except that due to my passion I sometimes get to watch some YouTube videos to do with this field and read some books
15/12/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Phiri, I appreciate your efforts that you are putting for you child's education.

15/12/23, 4:10 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Yes it does align with what I am aiming for
15/12/23, 4:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
15/12/23, 4:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course If you are provided with this career option how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?

I also see myself applying the improved healthcare systems that I would observe in India and other countries in my country as a Medical Laboratory Technician in any post of employment related to my studies at a public or private hospital or other institutions . I also see myself expanding my professional and academic network by pursuing higher education in this case a Master’s degree .
15/12/23, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Precious, Thank you for sharing your inspiring vision for the next five years. It's wonderful to hear about your aspirations to graduate as a Medical Laboratory Technician/Scientist and contribute significantly to your country's healthcare sector. Your commitment to applying the knowledge gained from Edoofa and implementing improved healthcare systems in your home country is truly commendable.
15/12/23, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I appreciate and admire your insight.

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

Proceeding further, you might be aware of that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education destination

I would be interested to hear your perspective on why you believe studying in India and within the Indian Education System would be instrumental in achieving your dreams.
15/12/23, 4:33 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: I have observed through my online research that India is ranked as one of the best offering medical studies which suits my goals. And I have also observed that in my country when one is critically sick and the Malawian health sector has failed to treat the patient, they usually refer them to India to get treated and to my surprise most of the people come back cured. This has taught me that India has one of the best healthcare services and if it is so it can only mean that the medical schools there are also top notch. Hence I am fully interested to study there.
15/12/23, 4:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Precious, Thank you for sharing your insights and observations regarding India's reputation for offering excellent medical studies. Your online research and awareness of India's healthcare services align with the country's recognized standing in the medical field. It's encouraging to see your keen interest in pursuing your studies there, and we appreciate your thorough consideration of the quality of education and healthcare in India.

I would also be exposed to the healthcare facilities that make my country refer patients to India instead of treating them here in Malawi hence will acquire foreign skills and ideas through diversity. Also the fact that the universities are globally approved would put me at an advantage in my career in the employment market. Therefore studying in India will have a huge positive impact on my career
15/12/23, 4:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Process, Thank you for expressing your thoughtful insights on the positive impact of studying in India. Your motivation to be the first in your family/village to seize such an opportunity is commendable. The exposure to diverse healthcare facilities and the acquisition of foreign skills and ideas highlight the enriching experience you anticipate. Your awareness of the global approval of Indian universities and the advantage it brings to your future career is well-noted. We appreciate your understanding of the significant positive impact studying in India can have on your personal and professional growth.
15/12/23, 4:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
15/12/23, 4:56 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Yes we are well aware that the expense of higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India is high. Hence one of the reasons we were interest in edoofa as it offers a more affordable education for international students compared to other universities/ institutions   through its Scholarship program
15/12/23, 4:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright,  Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/12/23, 4:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 4:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
15/12/23, 5:10 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: First of all thank you for the insight on the fees structure. However the fees is not affordable to my family considering that our monthly income is around $270-$300 which annually is around $3000-$4000 and this has to cover for several bills and other costs within the family not only education.
15/12/23, 5:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that Precious!

let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
15/12/23, 5:16 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Through the earn-while you learn program right ?
15/12/23, 5:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Exactly!
15/12/23, 5:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/12/23, 5:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/12/23, 5:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
15/12/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/12/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
15/12/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
15/12/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
15/12/23, 5:21 pm - +265 999 18 10 62: In the earn while you learn program, are the students allocated to work fields in line with their program of study or not ?
15/12/23, 5:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Phiri, Please note that the EWYL projects are online. In India, international student isn't permitted to do part-time to ensure they focus on education completely. The same is ensured in the Earn While You Learn Program. Just imagine, you having a physical job. You have to travel from your residence and prepare your routine accordingly which would affect your study hours, especially during exams. Now, the Earn While You Lear Program offers projects that are online which you can perform at your residence itself with flexibility in working hours which allows a complete balance between the program and education!
15/12/23, 5:27 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Well explained 👏🏾
15/12/23, 5:28 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Yes upon reading these I see that I can benefit from the earth while you learn program as it would indeed help reduce my costs
15/12/23, 5:29 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Alright thank you for clarifying
15/12/23, 5:29 pm - +265 999 18 10 62: Thank well explained
15/12/23, 5:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are most welcome!
15/12/23, 5:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
15/12/23, 5:43 pm - +265 999 18 10 62: in this case we can manage to source the costs as a family it sounds more affordable considering the EWYL program. So what is the next step if I may ask ?
15/12/23, 5:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you further, Mrs. Phiri
15/12/23, 5:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
15/12/23, 5:48 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: That is a tight one all the points are good . Let’s go for point 3 especially that first statement
15/12/23, 5:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on Earn While You Learn

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

15/12/23, 5:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
15/12/23, 5:53 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: My parents will be helping me out with the remaining fee
15/12/23, 5:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
15/12/23, 5:54 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Thank you for this proof of how genuine the EWYL is <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 5:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are most welcome!
15/12/23, 5:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
15/12/23, 5:59 pm - +265 999 18 10 62: As I said earlier, we are very grateful as a family that our child has been offered such an opportunity and we would like you and him too to know that we fully support him in this matter and look forward to a successful process to study abroad. Thank you
15/12/23, 6:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Phiri, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at an even greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help him in uplifting his family there by himself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to his parents.
15/12/23, 6:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
15/12/23, 6:07 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Yes I believe it is that and also transcripts which I believe I have sent
15/12/23, 6:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
15/12/23, 6:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
15/12/23, 6:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 6:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
15/12/23, 6:22 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Yes go on please
15/12/23, 6:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
15/12/23, 6:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/12/23, 6:29 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Alright understood
15/12/23, 6:40 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: So you have to apply to multiple universities after applying to you ?
15/12/23, 6:43 pm - +265 999 18 10 62: When is the session ending if I may ask
15/12/23, 6:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay as I was having my dinner.
15/12/23, 6:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It will be ending in 5 minutes, Mrs. Phiri
15/12/23, 6:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To us only, Precious, Please go through once again!
15/12/23, 6:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 7:01 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: As I’ve obseverved, this was more of a personalized counseling session (1)
15/12/23, 7:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is right!!
15/12/23, 7:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
15/12/23, 7:05 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Yes explain
15/12/23, 7:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
15/12/23, 7:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
15/12/23, 7:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
15/12/23, 7:08 pm - +265 981 74 12 53: Well articulated. You have explained in a way that makes us feel the process is not that much complicated
15/12/23, 7:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words!!!
15/12/23, 7:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
