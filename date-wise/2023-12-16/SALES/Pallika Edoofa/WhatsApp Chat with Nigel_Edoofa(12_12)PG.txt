12/12/23, 6:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, Kindly excuse me for the delay as I was having my dinner.
12/12/23, 6:48 pm - +263 71 939 3473: No problem

12/12/23, 6:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
12/12/23, 6:50 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Yes, they know
12/12/23, 6:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 6:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Yes
12/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 939 3473: They will try to afford
12/12/23, 6:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
12/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Yes tell me
12/12/23, 6:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
12/12/23, 6:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/12/23, 6:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

13/12/23, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
13/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Sorry i am late
13/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Yes shall we begin the proceedings
13/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Good afternoon everyone
13/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 525 3378: Good afternoon
13/12/23, 3:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good evening Nigel and Ms Tanyaradzwa,
I hope that you both are doing well.
13/12/23, 3:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


Continuing the discussion, If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
13/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Wow, this is really interesting! The Earn While You Learn Program seems like a great way to make higher education more affordable and accessible. I love the idea of students being able to earn scholarship credits by working hard and contributing to their community. This also teaches them the value of hard work and responsibility. It's amazing to see how this program is able to reduce the cost of education for students and their families. I'm curious - how does the program determine how many scholarship credits a student can earn? Is it based on the number of hours worked, or the quality of work?
13/12/23, 3:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, I'm delighted to hear that you find the Earn While You Learn Program intriguing! Indeed, the program aims to make higher education more accessible and instill a sense of responsibility and hard work in students. The number of scholarship credits a student can earn is typically determined by factors such as the number of hours worked and the quality of their contributions.
13/12/23, 3:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
13/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Number 1 and 4
13/12/23, 3:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Expert Career Counseling* and *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

13/12/23, 3:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
13/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 939 3473: I guess my parents will take over
13/12/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
13/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 939 3473: My parents think positively about me studying abroad, they feel a sense of pride in their child's independence and courage. They also feel excited about the new opportunities and experiences that their child will have while living in a different country. They also feel a sense of hope and optimism about their child's future, knowing that studying abroad can open doors and lead to new opportunities. Thay may also feel grateful that their child has the chance to experience a different culture and gain a new perspective on the world.
13/12/23, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
13/12/23, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
13/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Yes i also think thats all
13/12/23, 4:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
13/12/23, 4:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
13/12/23, 4:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 4:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
13/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Understood
13/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Yes please
13/12/23, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
13/12/23, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
13/12/23, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/12/23, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
13/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 939 3473: So how does one qualify for the Edoofa programme
13/12/23, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, I will be letting you know about this further.
13/12/23, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Thats fine
13/12/23, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
13/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 939 3473: We were at stage one since we were still at peronalised counseling session
13/12/23, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
13/12/23, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
13/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Yes please go on
13/12/23, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright
13/12/23, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
13/12/23, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
13/12/23, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
13/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Yes clear
13/12/23, 4:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

15/12/23, 3:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
15/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Absolutely! Here is a summary of the discussions I've had with my family about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. My family was initially skeptical of the program, as they had not heard of it before and were unsure of its legitimacy. However, after learning more about the program and its benefits, they became more open to the idea of me applying for the scholarship. They were especially impressed by the Earn While You Learn Program, which they felt would be a great way for me to gain real-world experience and build my resume. Overall, they were supportive of my decision to apply for the scholarship and wished me luck.
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
15/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 939 3473: For the moment they dont have
15/12/23, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
15/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 939 3473: Sure, I'd be happy to share my family's thoughts on the financial aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. My parents were curious about the enrollment fees and cost of education, and were reassured to learn that the program is free to join and that Edoofa will cover up to $20,000 in tuition and fees. They were impressed by the fact that the program provides financial assistance to help cover other expenses like books, transportation, and food. Overall, they felt that the program is a great opportunity to receive a high-quality education at an affordable cost.
15/12/23, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, It's good to see but I see there are misunderstandings, May I know at which part it is mentioned that Edoofa will cover up to 20,000 tuition fees?
