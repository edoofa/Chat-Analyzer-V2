06/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 914 3495: I am Tadiwa Hove ,a girl aged nineteen .As a Zimbabwean,I am originated from Midlands Province in Mberengwa District.I obtained six ordinary level subjects including English, Mathematics and Combined Science as I was studying at Makwau Secondary school in Masvingo Province then went for my Advanced level attending Arts and I obtained 11 points at Masvingo Christian Secondary.Our fees at Masvingo Christian was charged by RTGS but if we rate it to USD it would be more than $100 but less than $200 . Beside an Art student,I also like book writers ,the philosophers because my dream is to do Law as it will give me an opportunity to be a great thinker, because it requires critical thinking,and it will be a great program for me to take because my hobby are reading,debate challenges and I was also an expert in Public Speaking at school ,so I am confident that Law will go well with me
06/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 914 3495: I am from the Hove family as my father is Simbarashe Mareza Hove  .He is a Civil servant as a Healthy Information Officer at Mberengwa District Hospital and my mother is Rumbidzai Moyo  .She lives in South Africa ,as she doesn't have a professional job ,she had to go to work there inorder to get money to pay school fees , food,and others for my little brother and I . It wasn't easy for me to grow up to where I am now as my parents never got married,I had to live with my mother's relatives and she was struggling to send me to school as a single mother .My father has a family so he wasn't able to balance my lil brother and I as well as his family because with that little money he gets as a civil servant wasn't enough for him to balance his family as he has 7 children including me  but sometimes he would help financially to our lives.My father's highest education level was Ordinary level as well as my mother's,but I am glad that even though they  separated they both encourage me to do the best in life ,. With the status of my family, the difficulties that I went through while growing with one parent,I found my strength from that experience as it gives me the power to focus on my studies until I finished Advanced level
06/12/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Well received Tadiwa, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

06/12/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.* <This message was edited>

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

06/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Thank you
06/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

You can have a thorough reading and inform me once done.
06/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 914 3495: I am done going through and I had to note that India is the best
06/12/23, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Tadiwa

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
06/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 914 3495: I had once go through an Edoofian document and I learnt that an international students ' fee without schoolarships in India can range from six thousand to eight thousand
06/12/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
06/12/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/12/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/12/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Ok I understand
06/12/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Tadiwa, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
06/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 914 3495: I thought that it is a very great program which gives opportunity for everyone who is willing to fulfill his or her dream in India
06/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 914 3495: It is a great opportunity for the ideal students to get into such a program and I am sure I can be one of those ideal students
06/12/23, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: That's a great spirit, Tadiwa!
06/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwa, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
06/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 914 3495: It is affordable for studying in India than other countries through this Edoofa program unlike other scholarship,and that Earn While Learning program teaches and gives skills and experience to the Edoofian students
06/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Tadiwa!

That's correct.
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 914 3495: I do agree with that, moreover Zimbabwe is being affected by inflation everyday which is another factor which makes it even more tougher
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Tadiwa.

So now, are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tadiwa?
06/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Yes ,I do agree it is helping the students to fulfill their dreams and I hope it will continue to help them,all I can say Edoofa is like a saviour for many students who are studying abroad with it's help
06/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
06/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

06/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 914 3495: I got it
06/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Understandable and helpful
06/12/23, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
06/12/23, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Thank you for giving me more detailed information
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Tadiwa.
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Yes I do understand how Edoofa stand out from other programs
06/12/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Sure, Tadiwa.

You can follow the shared pictures and video.
06/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Ok
06/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 914 3495: I go through everything,and its wonderful and I learnt that hard work,and focus do pay
06/12/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: That is great, I am glad you are thoroughly following.

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
06/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Yes I am
06/12/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
06/12/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 914 3495: $1500 -$2250
06/12/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/12/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/12/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Ok
06/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Okay I understand
06/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 914 3495: I do agree
06/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Okay
06/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
06/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 914 3495: I understand
06/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Yes I'm following
06/12/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/12/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
06/12/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

06/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Am I not deniable to ask questions
06/12/23, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/12/23, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

06/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Ok thank you
06/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Go ahead?
06/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 914 3495: At which stage will I be asked to pay application fee
06/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 914 3495: It motivates me more
06/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 914 3495: What are the intakes for next year
06/12/23, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: Stage 4

Once you are found eligible for the program and you receive the acceptance letter.
06/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Thank you now I understand
06/12/23, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: August 2024
06/12/23, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: That's great
06/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Ok
06/12/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: Anything else that you would like to ask?
06/12/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 914 3495: For now nothing, I'm satisfied with the answers you gave me
06/12/23, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Tadiwa
06/12/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
06/12/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/12/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.

Section 5

It is true that many Africans have a poor diet because their farms stagnant and inefficient  to a lesser extent.However ,there are other factors that contribute to the Africa's poor diets to a greater extent such as lack of farming knowledge,climate changes to mention just a few.

African countries have poor diets because of lack of knowledge in the farming activities. Farmers to grow same crops season after season as they don't have the knowledge about the crops which will provide a balanced diet to the people.However,farmers in Africa do try to balance people's diet as in their farms they keep livestock as to sustain people's diets because we get meet, chicken,pock and others from livestock.Thus, Africa have poor diets because of lack of farming knowledge, however they do try to balance diet.

Apart from that, Africa is experiencing climate changes as there is no rainfall to make plants grow,there is too much sun which is also a factor which is worsening the situation in Africa and it's farming activities.At the end of the day Africa is not able to produce good crops to balance it's people's diets because of climate changes Therefore Africans have poor diets because of climate changes.

Further more, Africa have poor diets because most African farmers consider farming an activity to earn money rather than farming variety of crops for their diets  .Most African farmers grow cash crops so that they can sell to get money to satisfy their lifestyles because they are poor .By so doing they will concentrate on money making forgetting thing that balance their diets .So poverty is also affecting the diets of Africans.

However,Africans are having poor diets because of their farms are stagnant and inefficient to some extent because in Africa not every farmer uses his or her farms well , some of them do not have farming equipment to run their farms well so that they can produce good harvests for Africans to have good diets.Also some farms are no functioning at all so thus few farms are functioning and as an outcome the products from those few farms are insufficient to sustain Africa's diets.Therefore , stagnant and inefficient farms affect the diets of Africans.

Section 6
 
Sometimes people are inspired by other people's stories to fulfill their own desires and dreams ,but If it comes to me it's different. 

In  two thousand and four  ,I was born into this world out off wedlock ,but my mother doesn't consider me as a curse but she welcomes me with love .

In today's work if a child is born out off wedlock it is considered a curse because that child will live his or her life being named 
 eligitimate ,but with me it was a bit different.I was able to get the surname of my original clan and get to know my father, which is a blessing to know your family.

As a girl,I was raised by my mother as a single mom.It wasn't easy for her to tolerate all the taunts of the world because she had a child out of wedlock,but she was sacrificing everything for me to grow up and be a human being.

Besides all the   difficulties,I managed to grow up,go to school until I reached Advanced level and passed as I made myself a promise since I was a kid that I won't let my mother's sacrifices went in vain so I had to work hard in my studies.

Sometimes,I would think that I'm a curse ,but in the end I would always remember my mother's encouraging words as she always say,"Nothing is Impossible in Life,"these words would keep me going until now.

At school,I was an expert in Public Speaking which made me more confident about myself that I can archive something big in my life,so I have told myself that one day I can be a Lawyer as I'm very creative,and I like situations that deals with facts .Thatbis when I became confident to attend Arts at Advanced level so that I would fulfill my dream one day.

Living  and with a single mother isn't a curse ,to me it made me who I am today because it makes me want to attain my dreams so that one day I can become someone more valuable not for the world to see me as an eligitimate child.Also my mother's sacrifices encourages me the most,her tears ,her hard work  and her efforts to my life until today keeps me going.

My background,how I grew up until now is,"My Inspirational Story."

08/12/23, 11:55 am - Harmehak: You can share the voice note after your meeting in that case please.
08/12/23, 11:55 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
08/12/23, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th  or 15th December 2023.

11/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Thank you and have a good evening Sir
12/12/23, 11:53 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
12/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 914 3495: Fine thanks and how are you
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - +27 78 327 2010: Thank you very much Edoofa for accepting our daughter in this helpful program
12/12/23, 1:41 pm - +27 78 327 2010: Hope it will help her in her studies of her dreams,we are happy for her👏👏
12/12/23, 1:42 pm - +27 78 327 2010: We are trying to put our effort to pay that fee to secure her seat
12/12/23, 1:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you have any question for me from the acceptance letter ?
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - +27 78 327 2010: For now we dont have but if we have chalenges in the payments whom can we talk to
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - +27 78 327 2010: Yes
12/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
12/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828
