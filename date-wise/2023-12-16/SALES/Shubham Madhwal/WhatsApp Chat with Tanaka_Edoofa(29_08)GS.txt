A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

16/10/23, 7:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Yes
16/10/23, 8:06 pm - Gurvinder: Tanaka, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/10/23, 10:53 pm - Gurvinder: @263781962672 are we connected?
16/10/23, 11:34 pm - Gurvinder: I was expecting your response but it's been quite a day, and my work hours have come to a close. Let's pick up where we left off tomorrow at 10 AM CAT with fresh energy and ideas.

Have a restful night,
Blessings to you!

17/10/23, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals"*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
29/11/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 196 2672: Hello Mr Gurvinder
29/11/23, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: Hello Tanaka, how are you?
29/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 196 2672: I'm good and you
29/11/23, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: I am fine too.
29/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 196 2672: That's good
29/11/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: What is the concern?
29/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 196 2672: I wanted to know more about the Edoofa program and how to apply
29/11/23, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Do you recall the last counselling session?
29/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Yes we were talking about costs of applying in a university whereby you said 1 university ranges between $300-$450
29/11/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Alright let us continue the session then.
29/11/23, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Tanaka as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/11/23, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Tanaka_Edoofa(29/08)SM" to "Tanaka_Edoofa(29/08)GS"
29/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 196 2672: $1500-$2250
29/11/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Tanaka, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/11/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Okay I understand
29/11/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Yes I think so
29/11/23, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Okay, but may I ask something what are the 5'S of Edoofa??
29/11/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Tanaka basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
29/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Okay
29/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 196 2672: So which phase am I in
29/11/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Right now you are in phase 1.
29/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Okay
29/11/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: However Tanaka, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Okay I understand
29/11/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
29/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 196 2672: No
29/11/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tanaka, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
29/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Yes
29/11/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
29/11/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
29/11/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
29/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Let us proceed to stage 2
29/11/23, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
29/11/23, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
29/11/23, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You can simply understand the financial part of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc. A part of this fee would be due 7 days from getting the Letter of Acceptance.

2. Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).

3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include Accommodation, Food Expenses and Basic University Expenses such as exam fee, Library Fee, Lab Fee
30/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 196 2672: Okay

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Sixteen years after the genocide, the people of Rwanda have made significant strides in rebuilding their lives and their country. The following essay will seek to present a discussion on the economy and also the changes that have happened in Rwanda after genocide. It will state that the economy has grown, education and healthcare have improved, and poverty levels have decreased. However, challenges remain, including high unemployment, gender inequality, and ethnic tensions. Despite these challenges, there is hope for a brighter future for the people of Rwanda.

To begin with, Rwanda has made significant economic progress after genocide, that is the country has made remarkable strides in rebuilding its economy. GDP per capita has more than doubled, and the country's growth rate has consistently been one of the highest in Africa. This growth has been fueled by a number of factors, including the expansion of the services sector, investments in infrastructure, and the government's focus on promoting trade and investment. There have also been efforts to diversify the economy away from its traditional reliance on agriculture. However, despite this progress, there are still challenges that need to be addressed, such as high unemployment.

 Continuing with the education sector. After the genocide, the education system in Rwanda was in disarray. Schools were destroyed, teachers were killed, and there was a shortage of qualified educators. However, the government has made significant investments in education, and as a result, enrollment rates have increased, literacy rates have improved, and the number of children attending school has grown. While there has been progress, there are still challenges, such as the need for more qualified teachers and the lack of resources in rural areas.

Moving on to the healthcare situation in Rwanda. Before the genocide, the country's healthcare system was in a state of crisis, with high rates of preventable diseases and a lack of access to basic services. Since then, the government has made significant investments in healthcare, and as a result, life expectancy has increased, child mortality has decreased, and the rate of HIV/AIDS has been reduced. However, there are still challenges, such as a shortage of doctors and nurses, and the lack of access to healthcare in remote areas.One area that has seen significant progress is the fight against HIV/AIDS. The government has implemented a number of programs to prevent the spread of the disease and to support those who are living with it. These programs have been successful in reducing the rate of HIV/AIDS and improving the quality of life for those who are affected by the disease.

One area that has seen improvement is maternal health. The government has invested in training midwives and improving access to prenatal care. This has helped to reduce the rate of maternal mortality and improve the health of mothers and babies. Another area of progress has been in the fight against malaria. The government has implemented programs to distribute mosquito nets and provide treatment for those who are infected. These efforts have reduced the number of deaths from malaria by a significant amount.

One of the biggest challenges is the lack of access to healthcare in rural areas. This is due to a number of factors, including the lack of infrastructure and the shortage of qualified healthcare workers. In addition, there is a lack of resources for mental health care. Many people in Rwanda have experienced trauma, and there is a need for more mental health professionals to help them heal.
