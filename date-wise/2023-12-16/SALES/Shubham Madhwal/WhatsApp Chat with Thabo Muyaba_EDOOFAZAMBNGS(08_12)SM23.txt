08/12/23, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Greetings Thabo and Ms Mdeya! 
 
I am Mr Shubham, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa. 

I am here to discuss the application of Thabo 

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
08/12/23, 12:08 pm - +260 96 5754444: Am the mother to Thabo. My understanding is that you give scholarship to students who are willing to study abroad to be specific in India.
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

12/12/23, 10:12 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
12/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
12/12/23, 7:14 pm - +260 96 5754444: Good evening sir and deep apologies for the delay in response,  I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach out.
12/12/23, 7:17 pm - +260 96 5754444: My concerns mainly are about what it takes to qualify and how many seats to be specific are needed. And if one is selected, what are the services offered and how much effort is the institution putting in in order to help the students. And also the degree of involvement of both the students and the institution. Thank you
13/12/23, 9:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
13/12/23, 6:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
13/12/23, 7:21 pm - +260 96 5754444: Good evening sir I shared my concerns last night. Was hoping for feedback from there.
13/12/23, 7:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please for the same you will have to attend th session to understand
13/12/23, 7:29 pm - +260 96 5754444: Understood 
When next can we have the session?
15/12/23, 5:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hi, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application.
15/12/23, 7:38 pm - +260 96 5754444: Good evening sir deepest apologies for the inconsistencies. Could we please have another chance
