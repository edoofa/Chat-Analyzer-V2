*"Education is the foundation upon which we build our future." - Christine Gregoire*

With a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?
15/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 144 9309: Yeah sure go ahead
15/12/23, 12:53 pm - Kunal: It is a pleasure to connect with you
How are you?
15/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 144 9309: I'm fine thanks 
How are you
15/12/23, 1:00 pm - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
15/12/23, 1:00 pm - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*


In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
15/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 144 9309: They are not available at the moment
15/12/23, 1:07 pm - Kunal: Well
I would suggest that you can still add your family members because they can go through our conversations once available and it would help them understand the different aspects of the program. It would be easier to explain to them and to address their thoughts
Is that fine?
15/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 144 9309: Yes

I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
15/12/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 144 9309: Yes I am

15/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 426 4766: Chemistry has always been a challenge to me since O level ,I persued it because of my passion to be a doctor,but I hope for better grade when the results come
