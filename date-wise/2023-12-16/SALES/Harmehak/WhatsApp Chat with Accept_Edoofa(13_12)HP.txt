15/12/23, 11:18 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
15/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 699 1557: Yes I'm confident

15/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 699 1557: I can say during my last year doing my O level l used to sell sweets at school and teachers used to call me business man , later on in 2021 l was a shop sales representative dealing with clients in a good way and l was admiring my boss .l left the job and start my own small project almost similar to my boss in 2022 in February in my community which sustain my bus fare for 2 complete doing my Advanced level.I used to apply what l learn in economics and business Enterprise Skills putting it into practice in my own small business and it gives results.Thats why lm eager to study business administration
