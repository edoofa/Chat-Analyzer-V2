15/12/23, 10:02 am - Tushti: Adding to your knowledge you see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..
15/12/23, 10:02 am - Tushti: Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others.

I do siblings and they are both young one is in grade 6 who is a girl and the other grade one who is a boy
So far my parents have been supporting me from baby class untill grade 12
To my thinking. I thought adoofa was also sponsoring but later francisin a former njase girl told as that it's not a sponsor company  but currently I don't have any

15/12/23, 11:10 am - Tushti: Thank you, dear
15/12/23, 11:10 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
15/12/23, 11:14 am - +260 777828100: For my siblings not really they are not reason being is that my parents tries the best they can to make sure  that all my siblings go to school together with my cousin whom they are paying for

15/12/23, 11:54 am - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
15/12/23, 12:06 pm - +260 777828100: Knowing that my tuition fees are being paid I think my parents can try hard to make sure that I have everything I need I think they can give me of course not every thing but what they can manage
15/12/23, 12:17 pm - Tushti: I would like for them to come online and answer
15/12/23, 12:24 pm - +260 777828100: While my dad must be online
15/12/23, 12:26 pm - +260 777828100: Just wait a bit please

15/12/23, 12:35 pm - +260 97 9795286: It can be fine if my Child can be assisted with this program to study abroad if possible at 100% sponsorship however if I can be required to contribute something within my capabilities I am also ready.
15/12/23, 12:36 pm - Tushti: I am pleased to see that the family prioritizes Angela's education
15/12/23, 12:37 pm - Tushti: Mr Richard, the cost of education abroad without scholarship would be around $7000 per year, which Edoofa can help bring down to about $2000 per year
15/12/23, 12:37 pm - Tushti: Would that be affordable for the family?
15/12/23, 12:45 pm - +260 97 9795286: I can manage $1000 per year looking at the finances I receive and the people I'm looking after thanks
15/12/23, 12:46 pm - Tushti: Well, we do offer the Earn While You Learn Program via which students can self sponsor their higher education, do you believe Angela could benefit from that?

15/12/23, 4:55 pm - Tushti: Dear, how did you get the idea of studying Physiotherapy? It is not connected to agriculture at all, and is from the medical field
15/12/23, 5:02 pm - +260 777828100: Am actually I have various options I had said to my self in case this fails I have to have a second option because I can't completely depend on one but firstly agricultural engineering was at the top then my second was medicine
15/12/23, 6:07 pm - Tushti: I understand
15/12/23, 6:07 pm - Tushti: So now which out of these two do you wish to proceed with
15/12/23, 6:07 pm - Tushti: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day.
