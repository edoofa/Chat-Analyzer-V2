The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/11/23, 2:32 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Very interesting

30/11/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
30/11/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

30/11/23, 1:50 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Done Thanks
30/11/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
30/11/23, 1:53 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Second section
Questions for you
30/11/23, 1:54 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: It gives an insight of how  I should perceive life and challenges as an individual as well as a student.

30/11/23, 1:55 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: That every step taken is important in ones growth and towards reaching a certain goal
30/11/23, 1:56 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: It also gives the importance of cerebrating your wins and progress even if they're minimal.
One should always cerebrate their achievements as that can also help in building confidence of satisfying and accomplishing the main goal .
30/11/23, 1:58 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: The first section is also a good one as it simply explains the value of helping each other as individuals.
That as people we should be willing to help those in need with what we have and in whichever way we can.
30/11/23, 1:58 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: A candle does not lose its light by lighting another candle.
30/11/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing, I absolutely loved your thoughts🚀🫶🏻
30/11/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am impressed to a level infinity👏🏼🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!

4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance

06/12/23, 1:53 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: I haven't started yet 
As of now it's just theory perhaps questions will rise when I'm actually doing it
06/12/23, 1:53 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Welcome
06/12/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, of course you can connect with me anytime

06/12/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

06/12/23, 2:12 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: The project will require me to find students who have just finished their secondary school education or are in their final year and Inform them about Edoofa so that if interested they also enrol into the program
06/12/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Witness, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

06/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
06/12/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
06/12/23, 5:00 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Thanks Alot
Tomorrow it is
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Witness/Saloni/7DEC2023*
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Understood
07/12/23, 2:14 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: I see
07/12/23, 2:15 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Alright understood
07/12/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
07/12/23, 2:21 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Alright thanks
07/12/23, 2:21 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Noted
07/12/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Malawi*, where tuition fees range from K650,000 to K1,000,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K450,000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K800,000.↗
07/12/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: On average, parents in Malawi spend between K1,900,000 and K2,250,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.
07/12/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.💥
07/12/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Malawi, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.*

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

08/12/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Witness. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
08/12/23, 2:04 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: No I understand it
08/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter. <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)

11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
