15/09/23, 4:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
19/09/23, 12:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
19/09/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Friday, till then have a great day!
19/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 269 9037: Good day too
22/09/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 269 9037: Good afternoon ma'am
22/09/23, 12:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 269 9037: Its ok we can begin
22/09/23, 12:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Henriata can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
22/09/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 269 9037: Noted. Starting from next week I will be having less network challenges since I will be in Town. In rural areas network is bit challenging.
22/09/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 269 9037: I promise do my best.i will try to notify you in advance when I'm facing some challenges or when I will be in need of help
22/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I can completely understand that.
22/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
22/09/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 269 9037: As I told you before that Henriata won't be available until the 4th of November 2023.
22/09/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 269 9037: When I read the last part of your text I got confused where you mentioned that you don't usually recommend parents to proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. 

However, we are still in need of the program.
22/09/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 269 9037: Is it ok to wait for her
22/09/23, 1:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before she takes over her journey from 4 November onwards. I will not begin anything before she herself is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic requirements that need to be fulfilled.
22/09/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 269 9037: So we will wait for her?
22/09/23, 1:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Just complete these formalities and afterward, we will put the program on hold till she comes, please don't worry.
22/09/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
22/09/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
22/09/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
22/09/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
22/09/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
22/09/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
22/09/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
22/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 269 9037: I think we can proceed with the sessions. I will answer only what is required of me
22/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 269 9037: Whos EWYL group name I should write
22/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 269 9037: I think our sessions should be o Tuesdays and Fridays same time
22/09/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Write Henriata's EWYL Group
22/09/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, once you drop the message on the EWYL Line, we will discuss everything there.
22/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 269 9037: Thank you. Good day
26/09/23, 12:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How did your weekend go?
This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening on *TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳ this week.

16/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 269 9037: I have understood that   one need to work hard to be successful in life. You need to give to be the best in order to be recognized. I one wants to venture into any business one needs to start small and grow as profits are being realised.  As student you need to study hard now and enjoy the fruits of your results later.

12/12/23, 10:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
