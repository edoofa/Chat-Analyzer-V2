Hope you're doing well  please. 

I came across a challenge here,  one of the school heads I reached out to give me his back. I was not quite sure about his name so i made a mistake on tying his name. He saw the message, i  confirmed that through a blue tick but Sir didn't respond. 
I thought it's because he was not interested having his name misspelled.

Now I have the correct spelling can you assist me with a message to get back to him.
02/08/23, 3:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Pritchard let me frame a message for you.
02/08/23, 3:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: Greetings, sir,

I sincerely apologize for misspelling your name in my previous communication. It was not intentional, and I deeply regret the error. I have been making continuous efforts to reach out to you and connect.

Please accept my apologies and kindly respond at your earliest convenience. I value the opportunity to communicate with you and want to rectify any misunderstandings.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Ananya your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Ananya's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

09/11/23, 1:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *TUESDAY* once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 1:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

21/11/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 580 0065: A moment in life back during my high school, I was doing my  11th grade at one of the schools in Buhera, Makumbe High School. I used to study Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry with Mr Mushandu, Mr Rugare and Mr Natsira respectively lecturing the  subjects. I started my studies in the month of May 2021 as per the tentative opening date. Two months after our Physics teacher was transferred and the school find it harder to quickly replace him, it took almost a year without our Subject teacher. I have had nowhere to find my lectures which meant that I have to do it on my own . I was a newcomer,  I used to have a few friends especially on my subject area .
I told myself I have diligently work on my syllabus, it was hard to focus on the tasks I have scheduled on my own but there's nothing to do with it . 
I kept up with hard work until the school staff plans to present a teacher, by then it was 2 months before our final examinations. I was determined all along and at the end I came up with good results.

05/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 580 0065: Greetings of the day mentor,

Here's my  point of view regarding my session timings I think you have to reschedule my session timings you can schedule a convenient time for my sessions within the window from 7:00 am to 12: 30 pm, this period I can show my availability for the session and register the full attendance. This is so only because the network will be working efficiently within the range.After 12:30 pm I'm likely to be offline, I don't understand what's happening with our region currently.
05/12/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so shall we connect at 9:30 a.m.?
05/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 580 0065: We can connect at 9:30 am on Tuesdays and Fridays. Right?
05/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely!
06/12/23, 9:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Wednesday's Reminder_*

Wednesday is here, and this time our program director has added a personal touch to our lesson! ✨

So, don't miss out. If you haven't already, follow your *EWYL ritual*—do it now and get it!🤝🏽
06/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 580 0065: Good morning,
Hope you're doing well.
06/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 580 0065: I get it
08/12/23, 8:02 am - +263 78 580 0065: SATURDAY 'S ACTIVITY 

When doing my projects I am getting to know about each them, Paying much attention to my 2nd project ( Community building) I learnt a lot when trying to connect with students from different regions.  

 The skills i ensure should be mastered inorder to produce positive results: communication skills, persuasion skills etc. These skills are the most significant when connecting with students, in the event that you're somebody who's ignorant, you don't reply messages from other peers in time, you would not get it right you miss them students. They would be applying for other organizations. Students require someone who encourage them to take opportunities as they are, use them wisely and also frame ways to help their parents understand the same.Parents play a crucial role when it comes to the ongoing process of studying abroad, if they find this costy they would request their children to study locally. 

The other thing regarding the 2nd project is competition, there are many organizations outhere which are claiming to help students with opportunities to study Abroad in the same way as Edoofa do. So our students might end up having the idea that Edoofa is way  more expensive than others so as an individual I'm facing great challenges to persuade and cancel those with such point of view. 
For my 3rd project ( African Shoools Reform Mission) I'm eager to learn more when connecting with Headmasters.  I'm glad to sail through this project I will be learning ways on how to touch them professionally.  It is better if I develop this professional touch inside myself. However, even if some Headmasters aren't responding earlier, I learnt that Persistence is very important. 

So to improve on my respective projects, I am thinking of consistently connecting with each and every individual who has got interests to study Abroad alongside a scholarship.  More importantly, I'm planning reaching out  to students informing them about our EWYL program to factor out the the idea that higher education from is not affordable.
08/12/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: _*Session Postponed*_

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. Kindly submit your wednesday lesson on your EWYL Line so that I can assess it later in the day.

While we are not connecting today I want you to invest 1.5 hours more on your project. Looking at your progress I think you can submit two student application forms to me by tomorrow! So all the very best!🚀

15/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 580 0065: From the Wednesday lesson, I understood two timeless vurtues which stand out as pillars of success:  honesty and hardwork.

The Virtue of Honesty: 
Honesty plays a crucial role in Student's college life, it begins with being Honesty with oneself-- acknowledging  strengths and weaknesses, setting realistic goals  and understanding your limitations. 
It fosters a sense of pride in one's accomplishments, building a foundation of trust  with peers and Educationists. 

The Virtue Of Hardwork:
I learnt that, College life demands dedication, perseverance and strong work ethic.Embracing the Virtue of hard involves setting goals, managing time efficiently  and consistently put on the effort required to succeed. Also one of the  key aspects of hard work: commitment to continuous learning, is noted.
Furthermore i got to know about the habits cultivated through hardwork--- discipline, resilience and determination which extend  beyond the academic sphere preparing us  for the challenges of professional world. 

Happy Learning 💥
