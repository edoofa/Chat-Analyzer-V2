I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 896 1515: Please explain to me further on this one. Do you mean we have to do two session on Wednesday ,Tuesday/ Friday lesson for example then,  Monday/Thursday there are no session ? Then Saturday we do praticals?

29/11/23, 8:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/11/23, 8:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class ( L6/ U6/ A Level Appeared):

I will be appearing for my A Level (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
05/12/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.

3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
05/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 896 1515: Noted Ma'am.
05/12/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
05/12/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*TANATSWA/ADITI*
05/12/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
05/12/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
05/12/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

05/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 896 1515: Noted  with thanks .
05/12/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

08/12/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

08/12/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

My story is based on a street kid named Nhamoinesu .


Once upon a time in the bustling city of Harare , there lived a young boy named Nhamo. Nhamo was a street kid, born and raised on the unforgiving streets of the city. Despite his difficult circumstances, Nhamo possessed a heart full of determination and a spirit that refused to be broken.

Every day, Nhamo woke up with the rising sun, ready to face the challenges that lay ahead. He would scavenge for scraps of food, relying on his quick wit and nimble fingers to find his next meal. Nhamo knew the value of hard work, and he never shied away from any opportunity to make an honest living.

One fateful day, as Nhamo was rummaging through a garbage dump, he stumbled upon a worn-out leather jacket. Intrigued by its mysterious allure, Nhamo decided to investigate further. To his surprise, hidden inside one of the jacket's pockets was a crumpled piece of paper. It was a map—a map that promised untold riches buried deep within the heart of the city.

Driven by a newfound sense of hope, Nhamo set out on an adventure like no other. He followed the map's intricate paths, navigating through the bustling streets, dark alleys, and hidden corners of the city. Along the way, he encountered various obstacles and met a cast of colorful characters, each with their own stories of struggle and perseverance.

As Nhamo delved deeper into the heart of the city, he discovered that the treasure the map led him to wasn't material wealth, but something far more valuable—friendship, love, and a sense of belonging. Through his encounters, Nhamo learned the power of compassion, empathy, and the importance of standing up for what is right.

With every step he took, Nhamo's reputation as a street kid changed. People began to recognize his integrity, his diligence, and his unwavering honesty. Nhamo's journey not only transformed his own life, but it also inspired those around him to reevaluate their own values and priorities.

In the end, Nhamo's journey led him back to where he started—the streets of Harare. But this time, he wasn't alone. Nhamo had formed a tight-knit community of street kids, bound by their shared experiences and united in their pursuit of a better future. Together, they worked tirelessly to create a world where every child had a chance to thrive, regardless of their circumstances.

Nhamo's story became legendary, passed down through generations as a reminder of the power of honesty and hard work. His name became synonymous with integrity, and his legacy echoed through the city's streets.

And so, the tale of Nhamo, the street kid, serves as a timeless reminder that no matter where we come from or what challenges we face, with honesty, integrity, and diligence, we can overcome any obstacle and create a world where dreams become reality.

I'm doing well thanks you

Thanks for asking.
18/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Once upon a time, in a small village nestled among rolling hills, there lived a young orphan named Shupikai. Despite her circumstances, Shupikai possessed a heart full of kindness and a spirit that refused to be broken. Inspired by the timeless tales of honesty and hard work, she embarked on a journey that would change her life forever.

Shupikai was taken in by the village's kind-hearted baker, Mrs.Mutema. Under Mrs. Mutemas' loving care, Shupikai learned the art of baking and discovered a hidden talent for creating mouthwatering pastries and cakes. Every day, she would wake up before sunrise to assist in the bakery, kneading dough, icing cakes, and filling the air with the sweet aroma of freshly baked goods.

One day, news spread throughout the village that the King was searching for the most talented baker in the land to prepare a grand feast for a royal celebration. The prize? A lifetime supply of flour and sugar, enough to keep a bakery running for generations.

Shupikai's eyes sparkled with excitement as she dreamt of the possibilities. With unwavering determination, she set out to create a masterpiece that would surely catch the King's attention. Late into the night, she experimented with different flavors, combining ingredients in ways never seen before.

As the day of the competition drew near, Shupikai's creations became more daring and innovative. She mixed traditional recipes with exotic spices and infused her desserts with unexpected surprises. The villagers marveled at her creations, their taste buds dancing with delight.

Finally, the day of the competition arrived. The village square was transformed into a grand display of culinary artistry. Bakers from far and wide gathered, their eyes filled with anticipation. Among them stood Shupikai, a young orphan with a heart as pure as her passion for baking.

One by one, the bakers presented their masterpieces to the King and his royal judges. Each dessert showcased the bakers' skills and creativity, leaving the judges with a difficult decision to make. And then, it was Shupikai's turn.

She presented her creation, a towering cake adorned with delicate sugar flowers and filled with layers of unexpected flavors. With bated breath, she watched as the King took a bite. His face lit up with joy, and a smile spread across his lips.

"Young lady, this is the most extraordinary dessert I have ever tasted!" the King exclaimed. "You have combined tradition with innovation, and your hard work and dedication shine through in every bite."

Shupikai's heart swelled with pride as the King awarded her the grand prize. She had not only won a lifetime supply of flour and sugar but also the respect and admiration of the entire kingdom. From that day forward, Shupikai's bakery became renowned far and wide, and the village rejoiced in her success.

But amidst her newfound fame, Shupikai never forgot her humble beginnings. She continued to be guided by the virtues of integrity and diligence, always staying true to herself and her craft. And in the heart of the village, a small plaque was placed on the bakery's entrance, bearing the words, "Shupikai's Bakery: Where Dreams Rise with Every Slice."
