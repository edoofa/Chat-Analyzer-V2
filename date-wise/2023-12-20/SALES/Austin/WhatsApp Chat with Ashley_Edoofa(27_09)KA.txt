How are you doing?
13/10/23, 4:58 pm - Kunal: Hello Ashley, I hope you are doing well.
Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria.
In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.
Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
17/10/23, 9:03 am - Kunal: Good day to all,

I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal

I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
11/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Okay sir,,
11/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Okay sir,I think I may achieve better sir from my results

12/12/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:10 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?

This could aspire my career through better job opportunities as a student who studies in India is quietly extraordinary as compared to other students

As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Not that quite much sir
12/12/23, 1:24 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 1:25 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:25 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
12/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Okay sir, I have understood everything sir,I'll surely tell my parents about this information
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: Alright Ashley
Let me help you understand more on *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 656 7965: The EWYL i think i may benefit from it sir. According to the information I have red above,I think the programme is quite impressive. Sir if i may ask ,how does this progmme operates
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Kunal: Students are given real-time live online projects based on digital marketing, organization management to develop soft skills like communication skills, leadership, presentation skills, teamwork, etc.during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student's performance) which wouldn't be physical cash but they can contribute to a part of their higher education fees and make their university education even more affordable.
The working hours would be flexible and they would be able to make the free time productive.
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Kunal: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Okay sir,its clear now
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Okay sir,its clear now
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most

12/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 656 7965: This is quite impressive sir
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 656 7965: After the EDOOFA scholarship sir,both my parents will be funding my fee
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
12/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Okay thank you sir and I'll discuss everything with them sir.
12/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Sometimes they feel uncomfortable,due to the distance and the fact that I'm off the country. It's only because of this haven't happened in my family before so they fear a little bit but through all these explanations you gave me,they'll soon feel safe and comfortable
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - Kunal: I can understand
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - Kunal: Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

12/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Seeing another Zimbabwean being proudly happy about being an Edoofian,this will intrigue them.Thank you sir with the information,for this will make them feel comfortable with  me studying abroad
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Kunal: Glad to hear that
So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
12/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 656 7965: I suggest an application letter sir
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that these all are required
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
12/12/23, 2:30 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Noted sir
12/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
12/12/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Okay sir,if I may ask sir,the minimum requirement of A'level points is what sir.I know it is 2 A'level passes but how many points exactly
12/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Is it still above 6 points sir
12/12/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: As mentioned, the minimum requirement is two A-level passes
12/12/23, 2:56 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Noted
12/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 656 7965: We have discussed stage 01 sir
12/12/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
12/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Yes go ahead sir
12/12/23, 3:03 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
12/12/23, 3:04 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
12/12/23, 3:04 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
12/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Yes ,the process is now clear sir
12/12/23, 3:15 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
12/12/23, 3:15 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

They told me that they really need to know more about this programme as studying abroad is a serious issue

14/12/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 226 9119: I mean,do you really take into consideration O'level results that much as Ashley needs to rewrite his other 2 subjects in June and gets his results around the first week of August.This is because here in Zimbabwe most students may get to A'level with evenly subjects below five due to distractions they faced whilst writing O'level exams

For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc all you need to pay is $350


Cost of education
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc!
Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.


This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program.
15/12/23, 3:43 pm - Kunal: Ashley, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
15/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 656 7965: Yes iam clear with it sir
15/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 656 7965: The name of the course i would like to study with the EDOOFA program is Bachelor of business administration. With this scholarship program I will be studying in India. Without a scholarship, in India a student pays a fee of around $6000-$8000. If iam found Eligible for the program ,I will be paying an annual fee of $2000-$3000. If found eligible for the program, the total  enrollment fee paid is $350 whilst $200  is supposed to be paid in 7 day time and the remaining $150 in the following 30 days.                                           .                          .                                                               With reference to my understanding regarding the earn while you learn(EWYL)program,I have understood that it is a program which offers online projects to students who have been found eligible for the Edoofian scholarship program. The EWYL program helps students by getting to understand the real world through communication skills and others. This program allows students to gain credits through their hard work on the projects they are given <This message was edited>
