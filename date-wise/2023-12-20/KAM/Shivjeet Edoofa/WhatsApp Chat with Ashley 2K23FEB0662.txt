Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well.

04/10/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
04/10/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 006 4475: This is whereby you get offer letters from different universities and l get to choose the one which l seem suitable for me and commence with the university registration and admnistration
04/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
04/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
04/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Yes ma'am we on the same page
04/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Oky ma'am am glad to hear that
04/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
04/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

05/10/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student.

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
05/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Yes ma'am am ready for it
05/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Wow that's awesome
05/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
05/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 006 4475: I did review them ma'am we can proceed
05/10/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
05/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 006 4475: My Admission will help me process my visa
05/10/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes that is true we will help you process your VISA for arrival in India.
05/10/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Oky ma'am noted
05/10/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 7:34 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Ma'am you mean the fees will increase to approximately how much
05/10/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It will be a hike of arround hikes of around 20%-30%
05/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Around how much in cash
05/10/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The exact number will be mentioned in the offer letter shared by the universities for an example 

If your tuition fee for your one year in 2023 is $1800 it may be $2340 with the increment of 30%
05/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Oky ma'am I understand that thank you
05/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Yes ma'am its very clear
05/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 006 4475: No ma'am thank you
05/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 006 4475: You can provide me with the information
05/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
05/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Oky ma'am noted thank you for the enlightenment
05/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Yes I agree
05/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Yes ma'am I did understand
05/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Yes ma'am it's clear
05/10/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 006 4475: OK ma'am noted
05/10/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 006 4475: I have no queries regarding that matter
07/10/23, 11:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I hope this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that I was unable to proceed with our conversation recently due to unforeseen work commitments that required my immediate attention.

However, I am eager to catch up and continue our discussion. I propose that we reschedule and connect with each other at 3:00 PM on Monday. Your understanding and flexibility in this matter are highly appreciated.

Wishing you a great week ahead, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/10/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Good afternoon ma'am l understand that
09/10/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?

09/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 006 4475: No l don't have ma'am we can proceed
09/10/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Yes ma'am am ready for this
09/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
09/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 006 4475: Oky ma'am noted
09/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you have the statement of entry with you, dear.
09/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If yes I would be happy if you would share it with me @263780064475

19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Ashley!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
19/10/23, 8:48 pm - +27 84 355 4583: Yes
19/10/23, 8:49 pm - +27 84 355 4583: Yes please
19/10/23, 8:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
19/10/23, 8:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
19/10/23, 8:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
19/10/23, 9:06 pm - +27 84 355 4583: Oky thank you, l will come back to you tomorrow
19/10/23, 9:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
19/10/23, 9:14 pm - +27 84 355 4583: Glad to hear , thank you so much
19/10/23, 9:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
19/10/23, 9:18 pm - +27 84 355 4583: Yes its clear, you may procced
19/10/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
20/10/23, 10:51 am - +27 84 355 4583: Goodmorning Everyone 🙏🙏
20/10/23, 10:52 am - +27 84 355 4583: How is it paid do you give me a period of installments
20/10/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/10/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
20/10/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/10/23, 10:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: @27843554583 May I know if we are connected with each other here please?

20/10/23, 10:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask why is it that you wish to get the dates extended pleaes?
20/10/23, 10:47 pm - +27 84 355 4583: Am not yet financially stable since Ashley 's father passed away in May l have been looking after her . So l just need a few more time to raise the amount
20/10/23, 11:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about the challenging situation you're facing, and it's completely understandable that you may need some more time to raise the registration fee. Your commitment to looking after Ashley during this difficult time is commendable.
20/10/23, 11:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please also let me know by when would you be able to raise the required registration fee please?

I kindly request that you ensure your presence at the mentioned time to make the most of our session. Wishing you a good night, and I anticipate our conversation tomorrow.

23/10/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is why I have mentioned about completing the registration process in parts so that the $300 won't be a burden to you as well. Now, out of that $300, how much do you think you would be able to manage before the deadline?
23/10/23, 2:01 pm - +27 84 355 4583: $150 -$200
23/10/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. That's a good start, and I appreciate your commitment to making this work despite the challenges. Here's what we can do to ensure you can proceed with the admission process:

You can make the first payment of $150 as soon as possible to meet the initial deadline. This will secure Ashley's spot and allow us to complete the admission process. Then, for the remaining amount, we can set up a payment plan for the next month. Based on what you mentioned, you can pay the balance of $150 - $200 by the end of November along with the second part of the registration fee. This way, it won't be too burdensome for you. I hope you understand?

28/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley,

I trust this message finds you well. Over the past couple of days, our team has been eagerly awaiting a response from your end. Unfortunately, it seems we have not been able to get through.

We have been reaching out to you to get an update on the remaining admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of $507 towards your balance registration fee by today, 28th November 2023 However, it has been over fifteen days since we received any message from your end or any updates on your remaining registration formalities. This delay has hindered our ability to update the university on your scholarship status.
28/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we are approaching the closure of the current rounds of scholarship applications including your application today, it is important that we share an update with the university before the same deadline. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer. Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected.

I also noticed that you were able to review my previous messages, but unfortunately, you did not respond. This leads me to believe that you may be facing challenges preventing you from connecting with us. Am I correct in my understanding?
28/11/23, 1:29 pm - +27 84 355 4583: Good Afternoon everyone , lam blessed and alright thank you for asking. My apologise for late respond apperently am still working on the balance and l willbe able to pay soon
28/11/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's understandable that things can get busy, especially when handling the final details for university admissions. It's great to know that you're working on the remaining balance and planning to make the payment soon. As today marks the deadline, hence. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
28/11/23, 8:08 pm - +27 84 355 4583: Thank you for understanding and the major challenge l have right now is l get paid monthend only.

Thank you for getting back to us and sharing the situation regarding the pending payment for your university admission.

I completely understand that your payment schedule aligns with month-end earnings, creating a challenge in meeting the deadline. As it has been a while. May I know if you might be able to share me an update by now?
