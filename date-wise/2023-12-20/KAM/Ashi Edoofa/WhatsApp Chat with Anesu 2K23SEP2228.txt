29/09/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 876 2116: My network has dropped
29/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Done
29/09/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that, please. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/09/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
29/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes they are
29/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes am following
29/09/23, 3:41 pm - +27 84 923 8482: Yes
29/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 876 2116: On academic documents are you going  to wait for A level  certificate
30/09/23, 8:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not getting back to you. Let me help you understand, that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
30/09/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 876 2116: Clear. Good morning
30/09/23, 9:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/09/23, 9:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
30/09/23, 9:52 am - +263 71 876 2116: Very clear
30/09/23, 9:53 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 876 2116: Ok  lets start
30/09/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/09/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
30/09/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
30/09/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 876 2116: Ready
30/09/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

30/09/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
30/09/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

03/10/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Good afternoon. How are you today
03/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
03/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Am available anesu is in class
03/10/23, 12:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand that she must be busy with her lessons, and I am sure she will be able to catch up with our conversation once she is available.
03/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Ok
03/10/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. so may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
03/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes i watched them on friday
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
03/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 876 2116: I  first video talked about the important qualities of successful edoofians. These are good attitude and willing to learn
03/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for you response to the other videos as well.
03/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Founders talked about Edoofa vision finding quality education which is affordable
03/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 876 2116: On 3 they discussed on the universities they offer. They are accredited and give good quality education and affordable accommodation
03/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 876 2116: On 4 its about statement of purpose . This helps in acquiring a good scholarship. In the sop one states why choosing the university, why chosing the programme, and giving or considering th recomendations of counselors
03/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 876 2116: I just tried to summarise
03/10/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
03/10/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/10/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/10/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* I could see from your answer that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Ok thank i had forgotten some things
03/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
03/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes
03/10/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
03/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Noted
03/10/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
03/10/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

03/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Its ok
03/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So can I anticipate that Anesu will be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 pm?

03/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great day ahead, let us reconnect tomorrow.
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Ok
04/10/23, 6:53 am - +263 77 288 7407: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 876 2116: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 71 876 2116: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 11:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 876 2116: Apology accepted. How are you.  Wishing you well
05/10/23, 11:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your wishes, I am doing better now and Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
05/10/23, 11:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
05/10/23, 11:53 am - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe Anesu wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Planning, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
05/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 876 2116: Yes. Is the march intake
05/10/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263718762116 The academic intake in India commences in the month of August only every year.
05/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Noted thank you
05/10/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
05/10/23, 12:06 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes
05/10/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
05/10/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
05/10/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
05/10/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Noted
05/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes i agree
05/10/23, 12:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now @263718762116 among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
05/10/23, 12:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
05/10/23, 12:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
05/10/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Ok
05/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes they  have discussed about registration fee
05/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2700 to $3700 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes we are on the same page
05/10/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we are on the same page. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
05/10/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Noted
05/10/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $3600 as per the above example.
05/10/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $3600 - $750 = $2850. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1425 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1425 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
05/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Noted
05/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
05/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
05/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
05/10/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Noted
05/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Every thing is clear so far
05/10/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Alright please, Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
05/10/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
05/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
05/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Beautiful
05/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, it was lovely meeting them finally. I hope you are excited to see Anesu in this picture for next year?
05/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Ya will be expecting that
05/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Noted
05/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263718762116 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Thank you. This is good news
05/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, now moving ahead. 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes
05/10/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 876 2116: This will be appreciated
05/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Its clear for now
05/10/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 876 2116: May you provide this information
05/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
05/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Understood but if she get two passes will she up graded
05/10/23, 2:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as mentioned here, if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
05/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 876 2116: So what will we pay after  50%
05/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, and once the final results are out, the university shall re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
05/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Ok
05/10/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes
05/10/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Understood
05/10/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 876 2116: It is clear
05/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes its clear
05/10/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Understood
05/10/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 876 2116: So how much exactly would on expect to pay after beneffiting 50% scholarship
05/10/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263718762116 please do not worry once you receive an offer letter the exact cost will be mentioned, and will be discussed with you first in detail.

I hope we are clear?
05/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Clear
05/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now as Anesu's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Anesu is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Am   excited
05/10/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Thank you. Have a good day
05/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, and thank you.
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Anesu.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Lovely Professional University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 01.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 6:22 am - +263 71 876 2116: Good morning. Thank you for the news
16/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
16/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
16/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
16/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Noted
16/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
16/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Clear
16/10/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
16/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Clear
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $700 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$275 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$275 before 28th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $550 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Clear
16/10/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 71 876 2116: We stay in Chiredzi Zimbabwe
16/10/23, 5:11 pm - +27 84 923 8482: Good evening sir.Can I ask  a few questions.
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, what is it that you wish to ask please?
17/10/23, 3:25 pm - +27 84 923 8482: Afternoon sir.My first question is the name of your organization Edoofa or Anhad Education solutions
17/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask the reason that you wanted to ask this question dear, so that I can give you better clarity on the same?
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - +27 84 923 8482: Just to know how these two are connected
17/10/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate your curiosity. Edoofa and Anhad Edutrain Solutions are indeed connected. Anhad Edutrain Solutions is the parent company of Edoofa. It has been working in the field of education and training for more than 15 years now. Edoofa is one of the initiatives under Anhad Edutrain Solutions, specializing in providing scholarship opportunities for students to pursue higher education in India. I hope this is understood to you now?
17/10/23, 3:34 pm - +27 84 923 8482: Understood
17/10/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, shall we move ahead with our discussion dear?
17/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Sorry was busy with invigilation of examinations today
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here about the offer letter from LPU now?
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Good afternoon
18/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes we can continue
18/10/23, 1:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, Now,  If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 1:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 1:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Thank you.
18/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Is LPU the only university contacted or  which replied
18/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Can you explain
18/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with LPU by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at LPU  without risking losing out on the scholarship.
18/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $700 to LPU to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $700.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $700, but because you would have already paid $700 for LPU, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $700 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
19/10/23, 5:13 am - +263 71 876 2116: Understood
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Good afternoon
19/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Its ok will be available

19/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 71 876 2116: My network is a little bit poor but will follow
19/10/23, 10:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Anesu, may I know if you have taken a note of Mr. Rajan's details so that we can move ahead?
19/10/23, 10:58 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes we have noted
19/10/23, 10:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles using Ecocash, in case, if you wish to use the same mode now, shall I share those details with you here as well?
19/10/23, 11:01 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Yes you can share so that we may compare
19/10/23, 11:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, you can do the same on the following details, the transfer charges would be 12.5% of the amount that you will be paying:

19/10/23, 11:05 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Thank you
19/10/23, 11:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 11:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 11:14 pm - +263 71 876 2116: Its clear
19/10/23, 11:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 11:17 pm - +263 71 876 2116: No queries . If any arise will  ask
19/10/23, 11:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 11:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

20/10/23, 9:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand your concerns regarding the financial strain, and it's essential to plan accordingly for the registration process. If you are finding it difficult to raise the amount, in that case, what are your plans to deal with the same?
20/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 71 876 2116: We are still thinking of how it can be done
20/10/23, 10:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask, were you able to plan anything as of now?
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anesu!
