I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024.

21/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, parents and my dear student.

25/09/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is well noted and I understand.
25/09/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 747 7769: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 747 7769: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 747 7769: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
25/09/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 747 7769: Good evening sir ,l do remember the discussion we had.
25/09/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
25/09/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 747 7769: I understood that upon receiving an offer letter from whichever Universities would be interested in enrolling me l have to look the univerties up online and see which one is best ranked so that l can choose accordingly.
25/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
25/09/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 747 7769: We are on the same page Sir.
25/09/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/09/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
25/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
25/09/23, 7:07 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Thank you and looking forward to hearing from you tommorow
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 2:06 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Afternoon, am ready Sir
26/09/23, 2:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
26/09/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
26/09/23, 2:07 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Am ready Sir
26/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/09/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
26/09/23, 2:50 pm - +27 76 489 8532: U may go ahead with the discussion
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
26/09/23, 2:53 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Crystal clear my good Sir
26/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - +27 76 489 8532: It  does Sir
26/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 3:07 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I hear you Sir
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/09/23, 3:15 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Crystal clear Sir
26/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/09/23, 3:21 pm - +27 76 489 8532: May you please kindly elaborate on it Sir
26/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/09/23, 3:27 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I understand now, thank you Sir
26/09/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/09/23, 3:31 pm - +27 76 489 8532: In such a scenario do l get a refund  of the registration l would have paid or what happens
26/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We will come to that now.
26/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/09/23, 3:40 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I agree Sir
26/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/09/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
27/09/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/09/23, 4:04 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Yes my good Sir
27/09/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/09/23, 4:07 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Noted
27/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 4:10 pm - +27 76 489 8532: My phone had a problem  and got a new one so lost some of the information.Would appreciate a quick run over it
27/09/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
27/09/23, 4:27 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Please do
27/09/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.

You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
27/09/23, 4:32 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Crystal clear
27/09/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
27/09/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
27/09/23, 4:38 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Am following Sir
27/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
27/09/23, 5:12 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Thank you
27/09/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
27/09/23, 5:19 pm - +27 76 489 8532: No Sir
27/09/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 5:40 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Let me quickly round up at work Sir and will get back to you
27/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I shall wait for the same.
27/09/23, 6:15 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Am back Sir
27/09/23, 6:18 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Is it possible l pay the registration fees in 3monthly installments of $250 if for instance it is $750
29/09/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust you're doing wonderfully.

I wanted to share that I won't be accessible until Monday. I look forward to reconnecting with you on Tuesday at 5:00 PM. Wishing you a blessed day, and please extend my warm regards to your dear family.
29/09/23, 1:21 pm - +27 76 489 8532: No problem Sir
29/09/23, 1:21 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Have a lovely weekend
03/10/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Am available now,on a break
03/10/23, 3:38 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Good afternoon
03/10/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Kundai's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Kundai is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
03/10/23, 3:49 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I am looking forward to the next steps Sir
03/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Kundai's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
03/10/23, 3:58 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Pleasure is mine
03/10/23, 3:59 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Kindly proceed
03/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
03/10/23, 4:04 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Thank you so very much,be blessed too
14/10/23, 8:48 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 12.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 8:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by PDM University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 408 8685: Good morning Sir, exhilarating news indeed, God is good 🙏
14/10/23, 8:54 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from PDM University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 12:58 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Good afternoon,Kundai's mum here
14/10/23, 12:58 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Am at work and just started my lunchbreak
14/10/23, 12:58 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Will quickly go through it now
14/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to connect with you here mam. That is alright please. Once you are done going through the letter, please let me know.
14/10/23, 1:11 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Have just had a quick run over it
14/10/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from PDM University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
14/10/23, 1:13 pm - +27 76 489 8532: So my question now is that is it possible that the $750  registration can be broken down into 3 payments over a period of 3months
14/10/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: @27764898532 Thank you for sharing your query with me here. On that note, I would advise you to take note of all the queries that you have and we will discuss them towards the end of our discussion when we will have better clarity about the offer letter. I hope you understand, right?
14/10/23, 1:16 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Annual tuition is $1315
14/10/23, 1:18 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Accomodation annual fee is $1250
14/10/23, 1:19 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Registration fee is $750
14/10/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1315 and your per annum accommodation fee is $1250 which makes your per annum educational fee $1315 +$1250 = $2565. I hope you are clear about this?
14/10/23, 1:22 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Clear
14/10/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now when we talk about accommodation at PDM University, for the first year, it is recommended that the students opt for the on-campus hostel as they are new to the place and the university is in a better position to assist them with their FRRO.

From the second year, when they are familiar with the place and have made a few friends if they wish, they can move out of the on-campus accommodation and look for accommodation options outside the university campus.
14/10/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, your accommodation fee would be $1000 per annum and will have to be paid to the landlord of the place you stay. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70 and the cost of food would be $20 to $30. 

This means, with the off-campus accommodation, your per annum cost would reduce to ($1315 + $1000) = $2315. Are you clear with this as well?
14/10/23, 1:29 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I understand
14/10/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure-

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
14/10/23, 1:40 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Noted
14/10/23, 1:41 pm - +27 76 489 8532: So if l may ask is that the  only university thus far or l could still have other options
14/10/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that I have taken a note of the query that you have shared here, and stay assured that I will help you in understanding the same moving ahead during our discussion. I believe you are clear till here right?
14/10/23, 1:49 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Iam
14/10/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
14/10/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
14/10/23, 2:03 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Noted
14/10/23, 2:03 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Very clear
14/10/23, 2:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2315 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2315 - $1000 = $1315 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
14/10/23, 2:08 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Understood
14/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself. Now, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well -

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee itself, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be as below -
14/10/23, 2:10 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Noted
14/10/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, only your tuition fee is to be paid to the university which means, your fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565 and this will have to be paid in one part on your arrival. 

2. If you go with the *On-campus accommodation*, you will have to pay the tuition fee of $1315 and your accommodation fee of $1250, which means the total fee to be paid to the university is $2565 and after your registration fee has been adjusted, the balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815 which can be paid in two installments of $908 and $907. (August 2024/January 2025)

I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page here as well?
14/10/23, 2:11 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Is it possible you give us more options of universities to choose from as you had stated
14/10/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, as I had mentioned earlier I will help you in understanding the same moving ahead during our conversation. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier. May I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our conversation here?
16/10/23, 11:39 am - +27 76 489 8532: We are well thanks for asking.How do you do
16/10/23, 11:39 am - +27 76 489 8532: You may continue
16/10/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 2:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, since you are getting the Endowment Program Benefits on completing the registration now, in that case, you won't be getting the same if you plan to complete that in the coming year. 

Also, if I may ask why is it that you wish to do that in the coming year?
16/10/23, 2:57 pm - +27 76 489 8532: If l opt  to do the registration next year may you plz kindly advise on the fee structure
16/10/23, 3:05 pm - +27 76 489 8532: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, you would be able to change her course to the one that you like at that time as well, there would be no issues in that please. 

Moving ahead, it would be even more beneficial for you since, you would have already secured a seat for her and then based on the reslts, you can then change her couse. I hope this is understood?
16/10/23, 4:39 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Understood Sir
17/10/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have understood the same. Now, on that note, I believe you are now ready to move ahead with Kundai's admission process, right?
17/10/23, 4:09 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Good day Sir,am well thanks.Trust you are too
17/10/23, 4:18 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I have come to a decision that l will proceed with the payment of registration only when her results are out next year.Thank you.
17/10/23, 4:23 pm - +27 76 489 8532: That will be in the next 4months or so end of February next year
17/10/23, 4:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, are you willing to let go of the Endowment Program Benefits that you are getting now?
17/10/23, 7:35 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Will pay next year Sir after the results have come out
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if you wish to wait till the coming year, for completing Kundai's admission process, then being the Senior Admission Officer here, I would advise you to not do that, since there are several reasons to that. 

1. You would firstly lose on the Endowment Program Benefits that you are getting here. 
2. By the coming year most of the students would have completed their admission processes already and in that case Kundai might not get the same scholarship offers that she is getting now. 
3. Moreover, over the past 5-6 years that I have been helping the students in completing their admissions, I have seen that untimely actions in securing the scholarship often leads the students into getting to a position where they lose out on the scholarship seats entirely as by the time they become ready, the seats are already filled in. 

I hope you would understand the same right?
18/10/23, 1:56 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I do understand
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to respond to my message here earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter as well as the admission process. Now, may I know if we can move ahead with the same now?
19/10/23, 6:40 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Good day my good Sir l have been swamped at work and very tired.For now l will stick to proceeding next year when results are out.
Thank you
19/10/23, 9:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, are you certain that you wish to lose on the benefits that are being offered now?
24/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kundai!
I hope you are doing well today.

As you may know, today was Dussehra, a significant festival here in India, and our team was not available due to the holiday. On this auspicious occasion of Dussehra, I also extend my warmest wishes to you and your family. May the festival bring joy, prosperity, and success into your life. ✨

On that note, I would like to schedule a conversation with you at 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our discussion here about your admission process. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow, until then have a blessed evening!
25/10/23, 9:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 09:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
25/10/23, 3:38 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I was also considering that how about you find her a different good course she can do at L.P.U that she can do there as l prefer she goes there because looking at the reviews it would be the best for her compared to P.D.M
25/10/23, 3:52 pm - +27 76 489 8532: And if L.P.U also offers Biochemistry it is fine she can continue w it
25/10/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. On that note, I believe you had a discussion with Valerie, right?
25/10/23, 4:19 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I did speak to her Sir and she did advise that if l can l register for Kundai now before the universities fill up and also take advantage of the discounts am being offered now
25/10/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right. Now, on that note, what have you decided to do regarding Kundai's admission process?
25/10/23, 4:23 pm - +27 76 489 8532: That you try and find her a place at L.P.U and if they are not offering Biochemistry she csn switch to another good faculty of study
25/10/23, 4:23 pm - +27 76 489 8532: And once she has found the place l can proceed with the registration
03/11/23, 9:26 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai! ☀️
I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. 

It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 9:26 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents today at 02:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
03/11/23, 9:26 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 1:53 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Good afternoon have been swamped at work and on my lunch break now
03/11/23, 1:54 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Am available currently
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kundai!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 07:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 07.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 5:42 am - +27 76 489 8532: Good morning, we will connect then
07/11/23, 7:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kundai!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 7:54 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Good evening,you may go ahead
07/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 747 7769: Good evening Sir.
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, if I may ask, were you able to go through the offer letter from LPU by now?
08/11/23, 5:19 am - +27 76 489 8532: Good morning.l trust you are well.I have gone through the offer letter from L.P.U
08/11/23, 7:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kundai!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 7:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee? <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 7:42 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Good evening
08/11/23, 7:46 pm - +27 76 489 8532: 1. $975
2. 3years
3. $200
4. $700
08/11/23, 7:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
08/11/23, 7:49 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Clear
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU - <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
08/11/23, 7:55 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Understood
08/11/23, 7:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
08/11/23, 7:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
08/11/23, 8:00 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Crystal clear
08/11/23, 8:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
08/11/23, 8:02 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Am following
08/11/23, 8:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 17th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
08/11/23, 8:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
08/11/23, 8:20 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Am not in a financial position to pay the $700 by the 17th of November, I can  only pay it in 3parts of $250 end of  November, another December and last January if they can accept that
08/11/23, 8:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask what happened due to which you are not in a position to pay the fee timely please?
08/11/23, 8:31 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I can only afford part payments towards that fee at the moment
08/11/23, 8:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that, however, on that note, let us first complete the discussion here and then we will discuss about any of the challenges that you may have. I hope this is okay with you?
08/11/23, 8:40 pm - +27 76 489 8532: It is alright
08/11/23, 9:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, if I may ask, are you clear till here please?
08/11/23, 9:31 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I am
08/11/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
08/11/23, 9:33 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Please do explain
08/11/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:
08/11/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of November 17th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).
08/11/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of December 17th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
08/11/23, 9:47 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Is it possible to make it 25 instead of 17 as l get paid on the 25th
09/11/23, 1:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai!

09/11/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, can you please also let me know about how much amount can you manage to pay towards your registration fee by the given deadline date?
09/11/23, 1:53 pm - +27 76 489 8532: I can  pay the $550 by 25December once off
09/11/23, 1:54 pm - +27 76 489 8532: So if the university can give me up until then l will be grateful
09/11/23, 7:24 pm - +27 76 489 8532: Or $275 25Nov. and the remaining $275 25Dec
14/11/23, 9:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kundai!

14/11/23, 9:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Firstly, please accept our sincere apologies for the delay in getting back to you. The team was observing a week-long break due to the Diwali celebrations, and unfortunately, we weren’t available to address queries during that time.
14/11/23, 9:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, thank you for sharing the same with me here. On that note, since you have mentioned that you are certain about making the payment of $275 by 25th November and another $275 by 25th December, are you certain about doing the same so that we can move ahead with our conversation? <This message was edited>
