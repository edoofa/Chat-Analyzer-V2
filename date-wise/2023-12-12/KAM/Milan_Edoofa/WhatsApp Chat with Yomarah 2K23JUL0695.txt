18/09/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*
18/09/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/09/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/09/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/09/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 731 6907: I have reviewed them ma'am
18/09/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/09/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
18/09/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Yes ma'am l'm clear with it
18/09/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/09/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/09/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Yes ma'am
18/09/23, 5:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/09/23, 5:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Yes ma'am
18/09/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/09/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/09/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/09/23, 6:32 pm - +263 77 731 6907: I have nothing to inquire ma'am
18/09/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/09/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Please provide more information ma'am
18/09/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/09/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/09/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/09/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 731 6907: It's quite clear ma'am
18/09/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Yes
18/09/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/09/23, 4:01 am - +263 77 731 6907: 2.
19/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Good afternoon
20/09/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Yomarah,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with receiving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.
20/09/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Yomarah

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are facing any challenges since you were able to go through the message as well?
27/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Good afternoon ma'am 
I hope you are doing well too
27/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 731 6907: I am sincerely sorry l have been occupied in preparing for my final exams which are around the corner
27/09/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Yes, I understand that you must be occupied with the preparations, may I know if you parents are available to connect with us?
27/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Yes ma'am they can connect with you
27/09/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know by when will they be able to connect with us?
27/09/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Greetings , hope I find you well ,  may we connect tomorrow anytime between 8 am and 4 pm .
27/09/23, 4:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263718159158 thank you for sharing that, it is alright please, may I know if tomorrow 12.30 pm is suitable for you to connect with us?
27/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 815 9158: yes 12:30 pm is okay
27/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12.30 pm.
27/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 71 815 9158: thanks
28/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Good afternoon
28/09/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Yomarah.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us?
28/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 815 9158: We are doing well , hope you are also fine , yes we can
28/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. So may I know if you are ready to start?
28/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 815 9158: yes we can
28/09/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
28/09/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
28/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 815 9158: yes I have heard you well
28/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
28/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
28/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 815 9158: yes very clear
28/09/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
28/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Okay fine . Based on A Level results outcome I think options 1 and 2 are better .
28/09/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes indeed @263718159158. Now Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 815 9158: I believe Yomarah will pass her A level exams . On this one you can please elaborate a bit on the costs of the admission process .
28/09/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is completely fine. I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
28/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 815 9158: yes you can proceed
28/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.

You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
28/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 815 9158: very clear , thank you
28/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 815 9158: we can move forward
28/09/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)

The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here?
28/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 815 9158: sure , it is very clear
28/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
28/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 815 9158: no question as of now
28/09/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Yomarah's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Yomarah is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
28/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 815 9158: yes very  excited
28/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
28/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Thanks so much for this fruitful connection . Greet your family as well . Nice day . thanks
28/09/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you.
02/10/23, 5:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Yomarah!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
02/10/23, 5:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 01.00 PM CAT. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
02/10/23, 5:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Thank you so much
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Yomarah!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Good afternoon
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Yes we were able to go through it
03/10/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
03/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 731 6907: 1. $900
2. 3years (6 semesters)
3. $300
4. $750
03/10/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
03/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 731 6907: It's clear
03/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
03/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 731 6907: Noted
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
03/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 731 6907: We are together sir
03/10/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
03/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 731 6907: We can move forward
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
03/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 731 6907: It's clear sir
03/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
03/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 16th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 16th November 2023.*
03/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *16th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page. <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 815 9158: 1. *$300 before 16th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 16th November 2023.* Greetings , these two options are good for us .
03/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 815 9158: No , we live in Bulawayo .
03/10/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/10/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/10/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Okay , I have noted that . We live in Bulawayo but anyway we will find ways of connecting with him . For enrolment fees we used another associate's account by name Mr Charles Jerera .
03/10/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
03/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Yes please , Mr Jerera's account is very feasible to us since we are far from Harare . You can please share the account details
03/10/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
03/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Well received .
03/10/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
03/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Noted , thank you
03/10/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/10/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
03/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 815 9158: yes noted
03/10/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
03/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 815 9158: yes , its true , it will be more affordable
03/10/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 815 9158: one question I have is - How secure is the off campus accommodation for a girl child ?
03/10/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this clears the doubt that you have here, right?
03/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 815 9158: yes , that's good and clear
03/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask please?
03/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 815 9158: for now its fine and if we have any arising queries we will ask .
03/10/23, 4:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
03/10/23, 4:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

03/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 815 9158: this is exciting , thank you so much
03/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
03/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 815 9158: okay , well noted
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Yomarah!
I hope you are doing well.

Have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
05/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Good afternoon , we are still deliberating and weighing the options . We will get back to you tomorrow .
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Yomarah!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please I understand that since this is a very exciting opportunity that you have received here, it is very important for you to discuss about the same. Moving ahead, may I know that if you were able to get the chance to discuss the offer letter as a family yet?
06/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Good day . We are all fine and doing well . How are you doing over there . The opportunity offered is very good and exciting for sure . We have sat down as a family , had a discussion about the offer and the cost we are going to face for Yomarah to study in India . All positives were noted but we concluded that despite having the scholarship in place the cost of Yomarah studying in India has proved to be beyond our financial reach . Therefore we are decided that we will look elsewhere for her studies since we can not afford the cost associated with studying abroad . We are sincerely sorry for the inconvenience caused by this decision .

08/10/23, 8:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Yomarah!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/10/23, 9:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me here and I understand where you are coming from. On that note, I would like to have a discussion with you tomorrow and I would help you in understanding about the offer about here in the better way as well as how are we planning to complete the next steps in Yomarah's admission process.
08/10/23, 9:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Along with that, you can also stay assured that we have share Yomarah's application with a few other universities as well where the cost of education would be comparatively less that what you have now, hence, I believe it would then be easy for you to move ahead.
11/10/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Yomarah!
I hope you are doing well.
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier, so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University and could have planned the next steps in your admission journey. May I know by when can we reconnect with each other to proceed with the conversation?
13/10/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Yomarah!
I hope you are doing well today.
13/10/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Moving ahead, I understand that the costs at Galgotias University might seem like a challenge to you, however, on that note, I believe it would be better if we discuss this through and come to a solution rather than giving up on the opportunity, right?
13/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 815 9158: Okay sure
13/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 815 9158: From our discussion as a family we did go through the offer letter , it was very good , we weighed the options taking into consideration not to disadvantage the other our kids who are also in school , also the uncertanity in Zimbabwe after the past elections and we came up with the above conclusion . We do not need a situation where our child will get stranded in a foreign country while we are unable to pay the amounts needed . That was a family decision .
13/10/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that, however, in that case, why do you feel like you would be facing a situation in which Yomarah will be stranded here in India please?
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Yomarah!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier, when we were connected with each other here so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion and planned the next steps in your higher education journey. Hence, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other here for the same?
16/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 815 9158: I am not sure how to respond , our family position was communicated unless if there is another way to formalise our withdrawal . Good day .
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Yomarah!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I get what you are trying to say, now, in that case, I believe your main concern is on the total per annum costs of Yomarah's higher education, right?

On that note, if you would be getting another opportunity where the costs would be less, I believe you will be ready to continue with her higher education, right?
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Yomarah!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?

I hope you are doing well today.
11/12/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: It has been quite some time since we have connected with each other here. From the discussions that we have had over the past few weeks, may I know if we can move ahead with that here now and proceed with the next steps in your admission journey?
