08/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa added you
08/09/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Hi
08/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Good after noon
08/09/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings! I hope you're enjoying this beautiful evening. Kindly excuse me for the late reply. May I know if you are available to proceed with the session?
08/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Greetings to you too                      l am available we may proceed
08/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
08/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
08/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes they are clear
08/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 537 0886: I will be waiting
08/09/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
08/09/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
08/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes l am following
08/09/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
08/09/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
08/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes they are clear
08/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
08/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 537 0886: I don't have any  queries  you have made every thing simple and understandable
08/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
08/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes we can start
09/09/23, 12:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you're having a wonderful afternoon. I apologize for not being able to engage further as I'm feeling a bit under the weather. 

As the weekend is approaching, let's plan to reconvene on Monday to continue our session. I wish you a fantastic weekend, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.

15/09/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Loccadia. I hope you are well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
16/09/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 611 2479: Evening Sir
16/09/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Good evening
18/09/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Loccadia ,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Good evening
18/09/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Our weekend was great how about yours?
18/09/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. It was good too, thank you for asking. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
18/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Here l got that students must be skilled and open minded,and should follow Edoofas instructions
18/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Here l got that the Edoofa also focuses on increasing students success and making students reasonable and independent
18/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Here they explained how students are treated as family and are assisted in choosing the best universities for courses
18/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Last here l got to know how important is the statement of purpose and how students  must be diligent when filling the form
18/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
18/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
18/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
18/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
18/09/23, 10:11 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes we are on the same page
18/09/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
18/09/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:30 PM.
18/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

22/09/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening.

I hope you are as excited as I am as we are approaching the weekend. Please how are you doing this lovely evening?
22/09/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 537 0886: I am good thanks how are you
22/09/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
22/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Am ready
22/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Sociology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
22/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes the information is accurate
22/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
22/09/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 537 0886: I am ready
22/09/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
22/09/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
22/09/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes l agree a student can only study in one university
22/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes he did
22/09/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes we are
22/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
22/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
22/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
22/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes l have
22/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
22/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
23/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 537 0886: I understand

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Good afternoon
04/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Am available we can start our session
04/10/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
04/10/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
04/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
04/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 537 0886: No l dont
04/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Don't have any queries
04/10/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
04/10/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Am looking forward to
04/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
04/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Thank you
05/10/23, 9:10 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good morning dear parents and Loccadia.

With that being said, I will be connecting with you this evening at 3:00 PM for further continuation of our session.
09/10/23, 8:23 am - +263 78 537 0886: Good morning we are doing fine
09/10/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes am ready for the session
09/10/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
09/10/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected?  @263785370886
09/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 537 0886: This is so exciting
09/10/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Loccadia!

Please do let me know as soon as possible so that we can have the discussion of the offer letter at the earliest. @263785370886
10/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Good afternoon 

We can start our session
10/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that.
10/10/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, May I know if you are ready for this?
10/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Am ready
10/10/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/10/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/10/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Am done
10/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
10/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 537 0886: I understand
10/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 4:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes it does
10/10/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes it does
10/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 537 0886: I understand
10/10/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 537 0886: I would like u to provide more information please
10/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 537 0886: I understand
10/10/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Yes
10/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 537 0886: Am about to go for my history class in 20 minutes time can we continue Tomorrow
10/10/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if your parents are available to continue with the session, dear?
10/10/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/10/23, 2:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Loccadia, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process.

Hence, can you please let me know by when would you be making the payment so that I can share the same information with the university officials please?
24/10/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 509 6788: We are making arrangements we will let you know once all is well

30/10/23, 6:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Loccadia, it has been quite some time since I have been reaching out to you here in this admission group as well as over the personal window, however, I did not receive any promising response from your side, can you please help me in understanding about the reason that you were not able to respond to me in time?

02/11/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263785370886  I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discsussion here. May I know by when should we reconnect with each other here for continuing with the same?
16/11/23, 7:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good evening Esteemed Parents and Loccadia!
I trust you're all doing well.

It's been some time since our last communication. I'm excited to share that starting tomorrow at 06:00 PM CAT, we'll be initiating regular sessions. These sessions are specifically designed to address any queries, concerns, or discussions regarding the ongoing admission journey.

Your active involvement and participation in these sessions are incredibly valuable to ensure a smooth and successful process. We look forward to connecting here tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss and plan the next steps in this exciting journey. Until then, have a pleasant evening ahead.

I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
27/11/23, 9:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Loccadia!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/11/23, 9:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you for the past few days, because I was a bit under the weather and was not working since then. 

Now, that I am well and in a position to resume my work, I have returned here to help you ahead.
27/11/23, 9:11 am - Milan Edoofa: With that, may I know if we can resume our discussion here regarding the next steps in your admission journey?
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 611 2479: Afternoon
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 611 2479: Yes we can
28/11/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Loccadia!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/11/23, 9:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, I would like to share an important update with you here. As you are aware a significant amount of time has passed since you have received the offer letter from Galgotias University, and as you were not able to complete the admission process in time, the university officials are now deciding to revoke your offer letter and cancel the offered scholarship. 

Moving ahead, if you want to complete the admission process later on, in that case, you would be losing on the Endowment Plan Benefits that you had earlier received as well and the $150 Grant won't be available either. Now, I would like you to share an update with me on how exactly do you wish to move ahead so that I can share the same update with the university officials. Hence, may you please let me know when can we discuss that?
