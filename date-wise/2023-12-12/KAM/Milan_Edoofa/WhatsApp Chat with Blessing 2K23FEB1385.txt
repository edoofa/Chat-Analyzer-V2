Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

10/10/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

I trust this message reaches you in good health. Please let me know if you are available so that we can further proceed with the session.
10/10/23, 3:19 pm - +27 82 349 8192: You can proceed but will only respond later due to work constraints
10/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
10/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 6:59 am - +27 82 349 8192: Morning ..yes I do recall the steps and some of them we have gone through them ,even the SOP was submitted
13/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 8:26 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Yes we can proceed ..good evening
13/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
13/10/23, 8:46 pm - +27 82 349 8192: My understanding is that after receiving offer letters from different universities you have to select 1 and then the registration starts where by you have to pay a registration fee for the student to be enrolled inthat particular university
13/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
13/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
13/10/23, 9:34 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Correct
13/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
13/10/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 9:45 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Well appreciated
13/10/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
13/10/23, 10:03 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Yes ,ready
13/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
13/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
13/10/23, 10:06 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Pliz explain point number 3
13/10/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly I will, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
13/10/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
13/10/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
13/10/23, 10:11 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Understood
13/10/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
13/10/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
13/10/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/10/23, 10:20 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Yes
13/10/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
13/10/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/10/23, 10:22 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Well understood
13/10/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now and let us connect tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM. Have a great day ahead!
13/10/23, 10:33 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Thank you ..good night
14/10/23, 8:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, Dear parents and Blessing. 

How are you doing this lovely weekend?
14/10/23, 8:02 am - +27 82 349 8192: We are all good and how are you
14/10/23, 8:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.If you are ready shall we proceed with the session?
14/10/23, 8:33 am - +27 82 349 8192: Yes
14/10/23, 8:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/10/23, 8:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/10/23, 8:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/10/23, 8:39 am - +27 82 349 8192: Understood
14/10/23, 8:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/10/23, 8:52 am - +27 82 349 8192: Pliz provide information
14/10/23, 8:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 8:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 8:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/10/23, 8:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
14/10/23, 9:10 am - +27 82 349 8192: Noted
14/10/23, 9:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/10/23, 9:21 am - +27 82 349 8192: Option 1
14/10/23, 9:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/10/23, 9:22 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/10/23, 9:38 am - +27 82 349 8192: Crystal clear
14/10/23, 9:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
14/10/23, 9:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/10/23, 9:41 am - +27 82 349 8192: Noted
14/10/23, 9:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/10/23, 9:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 10:01 am - +27 82 349 8192: All clear will ask if questions arise
14/10/23, 10:10 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Blessing's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Blessing is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
14/10/23, 10:24 am - +27 82 349 8192: Yes
14/10/23, 10:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Blessing's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
14/10/23, 11:32 am - +27 82 349 8192: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 11:33 am - +27 82 349 8192: Noted ..thank you and above is his latest result slip from school
17/10/23, 10:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. We have some incredible news to share with you and your family! 

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application at the universities in India under the Endowment plan.
17/10/23, 10:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With all the efforts we have invested, I am thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

Once you have taken note of this letter, please let me know so that we can schedule our next discussion accordingly. Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐

18/10/23, 11:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I wanted to follow up on the exciting updates we shared with you yesterday regarding your university admission. Have you had the chance to review my previous messages and take note of the offer letter shared with you?

Your response is crucial to us, as it will allow us to schedule a discussion and get into the offer letter details thoroughly. We value your timely response and hence, look forward to connecting with you at your earliest to move forward with the next steps in your admission cycle.
18/10/23, 11:58 am - +27 82 349 8192: Morning hope you are well too ..yes we are still going through the letter and still trying to find much information about the institution.For now we are even thinking that if it's allowed we can hold the process and wait for him to get his results so he can maybe get accepted inthe institutions that we were looking forward to..

Because in all our previous searches on Universities that institution does not come up on rankings so we are not sure whether it will be good to send the child far away from home into an institution that we are not quite happy about ,and previously on our discussions if I remember well offer letters from different universities were mentioned so a parent can have an option to choose..
18/10/23, 12:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I appreciate your response, and it is completely understandable that you're taking the time to thoroughly review the offer letter and consider your options. The well-being and future of your child are of paramount importance.

Rest assured, that we are here to help you feel confident about the choice you make for your child's education. The ranking and reputation of the institution do play a significant role in this decision, and we respect your diligence in this matter.
18/10/23, 12:03 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Thank you ..will engage and see the way forward
18/10/23, 12:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @27823498192. At the same time, addressing the concern you highlighted, indeed during our previous discussions, we did mention offer letters from different universities, and it's certainly a way for parents to have options and make an informed decision that aligns with their preferences and expectations.
18/10/23, 12:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To address the same concern shared by you, let me tell you that this is the first university that has accepted Blessing's application for a scholarship, and it is a significant achievement for him. 

If you go through my above message, it will help you see that we are due to have a detailed conversation regarding this offer letter and guide you through the admission process. 

To ensure we can discuss the offer letter thoroughly and address any questions or concerns you may have, could you kindly confirm if you will be available to connect with us today in the evening at 07:30 PM?
18/10/23, 12:06 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Yes having an option to choose gives us a chance to make a comparison between different institutions
18/10/23, 12:06 pm - +27 82 349 8192: This message was deleted
18/10/23, 12:07 pm - +27 82 349 8192: This message was deleted
18/10/23, 12:08 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Yes I will ba available
18/10/23, 12:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely, and that's a commitment we have made to you. You can be confident about your child's university admission, and we are here to guide you through the process. Right now, your role as a parent is to gain a better understanding of the process so that you can make an informed decision for Blessing's higher education and take full advantage of the Endowment Plan.
18/10/23, 12:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Since you have also confirmed our connection for later in the evening, let us plan to reconvene at 7:30 PM. We eagerly anticipate our discussion, during which we will not only address any questions you have but also thoroughly go through the offer letter with you. Rest assured, we are here to support you every step of the way.
18/10/23, 12:11 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Thank you
18/10/23, 7:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening once again Parents and Blessing,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 7:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 7:53 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Yes we have gone through it but as I stated earlier it has become a bit difficult for us because there are no options here ,it's just one institution
18/10/23, 7:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that addressing these concerns is a priority for us. To provide you with more clarity and help you understand the process, we will discuss the specific offer letter in detail during our conversation today. 

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide you with information on the steps required to secure the scholarship offer. This way, we aim to alleviate your concerns and ensure you have a better understanding of the situation.
18/10/23, 7:57 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Noted
18/10/23, 7:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @27823498192. The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 7:58 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Advise and I will respond in due course ,something came and am still busy at work
18/10/23, 8:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, @27823498192, I am looking forward to a response from your end. Also, now that we are all set to discuss Blessing's offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 8:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, once you are available, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s Blessing's per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
19/10/23, 6:17 am - +27 82 349 8192: Good morning hope I find you well.

All the points above have been noted ,but as I stated before that in previous discussions it was stated that offer letters will be from different universities so I will have an option to choose ..

In the current situation there is no option because the offer is from one institution and honestly speaking I have been searching for this institution among India's top 100 institutions and it's nowhere to be found..

So inthis instance it's difficult for me to look at the admission process for this particular institution because I have no interest in sending my child far away from home to an unknown institution..

As I said if the fact that he does not have his 'A' level results rather the whole process be put on hold and only proceed when his results are out so he can get offers from institutions that we will be all happy about..

So I would like to know whether everything can be put on hold until next year then we can target the 2025 intake ..

Your clarity onthe above will be greatly appreciated but the honest truth is I am not prepared to discuss Galgotias University
19/10/23, 10:53 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good morning to you as well @27823498192, we are doing well, thank you for your concern and I hope you are doing well too.
19/10/23, 11:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I was able to go through the message you shared and I understand your concerns and your preference for having options from different universities. In cases where you receive an offer from a particular institution you are not familiar with, it's essential to make the best choice for your child's education. As I mentioned earlier, we certainly appreciate your honesty and your desire to ensure your child's future education aligns with your expectations.
19/10/23, 11:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, @27823498192, it's important to note that Edoofa has over 13 years of experience in the education sector. During this time, we've identified reputable universities that provide quality education while also considering affordability. If you feel that the university you received an offer from doesn't meet your expectations, I suggest connecting with us to have a discussion and gain more insights.
19/10/23, 11:05 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Rather, if you believe your assumptions are sufficient to make a decision, it might not be the best course of action. It is crucial to explore the offer and get a clearer understanding. Please keep in mind that the offer letters have an associated due date of 31st October. Missing this deadline may result in the university not considering Blessing's application further. It's a critical decision, and hence, once again all I can do is encourage you to discuss it further with the team to make an informed choice.
19/10/23, 11:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, as we discussed the other day, this is the first offer letter that Blessing has received. To understand how the admission process is carried out and when you can expect another offer letter, it's crucial for you to have a discussion with the team and gain a clear understanding of the process. Only then can you see the bigger picture.

@27823498192, please don't take this the wrong way, but if you re not open to listening to the team, in the end, it will be Blessing who could potentially be at a loss. As a parent, I am sure this is not something you wish for. It is essential to make well-informed decisions for your child's education, and the Edoofa team is here to provide guidance and support to ensure the best outcomes for Blessing.
19/10/23, 11:12 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, addressing the last concern you shared, the availability of A-Level results doesn't determine the number of university choices Blessing will get. Even without the A-Level results, Blessing's application can be and has been processed to the universitues for a scholarship. I believe Mr. Shiveejt from our team must have helped you understand how the process is carried out under the Endowment Plan, and back then, you didn't express this concern.
19/10/23, 11:12 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Regarding the part where you mentioned putting everything on hold until next year for the 2025 intake, the A-Level results will be released in January 2024. This would still prepare Blessing to join the August 2024 intake. Therefore, I didn't quite understand why you're considering a gap year. Is it because you need more time to prepare your finances? The timelines and university options can be addressed. It's crucial not to miss the current opportunities for Blessing's education and hence it is important for you to be transparent.
19/10/23, 11:28 am - +27 82 349 8192: The gap is a preference if it will mean my son can get another institution ..I am opening to lestening to the team because you have vast experience inthis field but inthis instance I am not interested inthe university that have given the offer letter due to the reasons I stated above ..

Overall all advice from the team will be well accepted but not regarding this institution ,I have done my research and I don't see it anywhere among the list of well recognised institutions in India
19/10/23, 11:45 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, @27823498192, we understand your concern about Galgotias University. While your preference is important, it's essential to consider that Galgotias University is indeed a respected institution with numerous accolades. It is consistently ranked among the top 100 universities in India by various ranking bodies such as MDRA and NIRF.
19/10/23, 11:45 am - Vilsha Edoofa: For your reference, here are some me key points to note about Galgotias University include:

1. *Accreditation:* The university holds NAAC A+ Accreditation, which signifies a high standard of academic excellence.

2. *Placement Record:* Galgotias University boasts a remarkable 100% placement record, which indicates the employability of its graduates.

3. *Student-Focused Approach:* The university follows a "students-first" philosophy, emphasizing the well-being and success of its students. This aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

4. *Low Student-to-Faculty Ratio:* Galgotias University maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio, ensuring that students receive individualized attention and mentoring, creating a supportive learning environment.
19/10/23, 11:46 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To explore further and gain a better understanding, you can visit the university's official website. Here, you will find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, indicating the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.

Please use this link to visit the [Galgotias University Government Recognition](https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition) page.

You can access the virtual tour through this link: [Galgotias University Virtual Campus Tour](https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour).
19/10/23, 11:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: We encourage you to make use of these resources to familiarize yourself with the university, even if visiting the campus in person is not currently feasible. Once you have conducted thorough research, you'll be in a better position to form an informed opinion about the university. However, @27823498192, it's essential to ensure that you have all the facts before making any judgments or assumptions. Making a decision without adequate information might risk missing out on an opportunity for Blessing.

We are here to provide information and guidance, and if you have a different perspective or preference, that's absolutely fine. 

We have applied to other universities for Blessing, and once we receive updates, we will inform you. In the meantime, if you wish to understand how the admission process is carried out or have any questions, I am more than willing to help. Just let me know what specific information or assistance you require. Your comfort and confidence in the decision-making process are important to us.

26/10/23, 8:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Blessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the message you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for not being able to check your message today. India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 8:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 8:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 8:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time.

26/10/23, 9:42 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Below is a list of questions that I have about the admission procedure..good evening..

(1)Is the $300 admission and procedure fee the one payable with 15 working days of receiving the offer letter ??

(2) At what time during the process is the registration fee of $750 supposed to be paid??

(3)There is a part onthe offer letter that says "A level results pending,please submit before registration,else your admission will be cancelled.What does this statement mean as we will be getting the 'A' level results in February 2024?.

(5)When is the student ID fee and the caution/ERP fee supposed to be paid??

I thank you
03/11/23, 2:47 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Blessing,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the admissions for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 2:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are in good health. I have carefully reviewed your previous message and would like to assure you that I will address each of your queries. Before we dive into that, I have some exciting news to share with you.

I trust you're all doing well.

I'm Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. Now, I was going through your application file and I saw that it's been some time since our last communication.

17/11/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: We are doing fine as well, thank you for asking.
17/11/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, earlier when Ms. Vilsha had connected with you here, she had shared an offer letter from LPU with you, however, after that you did not respond to us her. May I know why is that please, what happened?
17/11/23, 11:16 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Was away ,something bad happened to one of my family members ,I had to attend to that matter urgently so I lost track of everything
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
28/11/23, 9:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 9:13 am - Milan Edoofa: It's been over five days since we last connected regarding the next steps in your admission journey. I understand that life can get busy, however, since I did not get any response from your side I was concerned about the same. 

May I know if everything is fine at your end and if you would be able to connect with me here today in order to continue with our discussions regarding your admission process as well as the next steps?
28/11/23, 12:23 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Afternoon ..hope you are all well ..Will it be fine if we connect on Thursday ..It's the festive season now and it's a bit hectic at work..

11/12/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing!
I hope you are doing well today.
11/12/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: It has been quite some time since we have connected with each other here. From the discussions that we have had over the past few weeks, may I know if we can move ahead with that here now and proceed with the next steps in your admission journey?
11/12/23, 4:20 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Greetings to you ..all is well
11/12/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, shall we continue with our discussion now?
11/12/23, 4:48 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Yes
11/12/23, 4:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, it has been too much time that we have been through the admission process, hence, may you please let me know how is it that you have planned to move ahead with Blessing's admission process?
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - +27 82 349 8192: The only thing that have bothered me with the university admission is the fact that the process is not complete until the results are out and the admission fee is non refundable ..so with us the results will only be out in February and to fork out more than 700 US dollars that I know will never be refunded is a bit of a problem
11/12/23, 5:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, are you considering the fact that Blessing won't even pass the exams and won't be moving ahead with higher education, is that so?
11/12/23, 5:22 pm - +27 82 349 8192: He will be moving ahead but the fact that the fee is said to be non refundable is not a good term considering how difficult it is to raise such money
11/12/23, 5:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. Now, in that case, if you are so certain that Blessing will be moving ahead, then why is it that you are worried about the refund clause?
11/12/23, 5:33 pm - +27 82 349 8192: As families who are struggling to raise funds ,it's always easier to work with something that you have at hand not on assumptions

11/12/23, 5:57 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Am saying it's a bit of a substantial amount of money to raise when you don't know exactly what will be the outcome
11/12/23, 6:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: But here the situation is not like that you don't know what will the outcome be. Once you will complete the admission process, the seat for Blessing will be reserved and then in the coming year, when the results will be out, scholarship will be reevaluated and might as well increase based on the results, and moving ahead, the higher education journey will start in August 2024. I do not understand where is the uncertainty that lies here?
11/12/23, 6:26 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Yes I understand your explanation ,as an professional in this field I value your opinion and I will follow your guidelines..the uncertainty remians the same as I stated
