10/10/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
10/10/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
10/10/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
10/10/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
10/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes they are very clear
10/10/23, 3:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
10/10/23, 3:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
10/10/23, 3:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
10/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes I am following
10/10/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
10/10/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
10/10/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
10/10/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
10/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes,they are very clear
10/10/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
10/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes ma'am
10/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
10/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

10/10/23, 4:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 9:00 am for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to complete all the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
10/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 110 5343: same to you Ma'am
10/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 110 5343: Thank you
10/10/23, 4:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you and you are most welcome @263781105343
11/10/23, 8:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Shumirai, I hope you find this message in high spirit. 

As we move forward with your journey, I would like to follow up on the videos we shared with you. Can you please confirm if you have watched the videos?

If you have watched the videos, please share your understanding and insights with us. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 110 5343: we are good thank you Ma'am .                                             Yes I have watched the videos and firstly I would like to say they were very clear and helpful as they gave an insight of specifically of how the students should behave themselves in the admission journey .On the first video I learn that following instructions is one of the most important thinks a student should do and also the student is supposed to be open minded as well as someone who is teachable.Furthermore , on the second video I learn and understood that Edoofa's main vision is to make international students more responsible and independent through the SEELS program such as the earn while you learn as this makes them even ready to be employable and work well with others in the society.Moreover the third video was about the Edoofa dedication and commitment in order to make students have the chance to learn at the most good and prestigious institutions.In conclusion, on the last vedio I understood that there is a document called the Statement Of Purpose which every student is supposed to fill their details showing their skills ,strengths ,weaknesses as well as their previous academic achievements
11/10/23, 9:17 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Shumirai, that is correct. These videos have provided you with a comprehensive understanding of the admission journey and how Edoofa supports students in their pursuit of higher education. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
11/10/23, 9:17 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
11/10/23, 9:18 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
11/10/23, 9:18 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to students' career goals.
11/10/23, 9:18 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
11/10/23, 9:18 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
11/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am that is absolutely correct
11/10/23, 9:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have deeply understood all the videos, @263781105343. With this, we have successfully completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office). Therefore, we will now progress to the second step in her admission journey, which is the *Statement of purpose.* May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 110 5343: yes Maam ...we are on the same page
11/10/23, 9:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing! Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 9:00 AM.
11/10/23, 9:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. 

If you want to submit the documents now, you can do so. This will allow us to move to the next step.

11/10/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 110 5343: This message was deleted

11/10/23, 12:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263781105343, As the first needs to be answered in the form of audio, you need to share your response in the same manner.
11/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 110 5343: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 110 5343: 2.Explain about BPM( Business Process Management) life cycle
11/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 110 5343: The BPM(Business Process Management) life cycle is a process used to manage and improve business processes. The cycle includes five steps: define, model, analyze, design, and implement. Each step plays a crucial role in ensuring that business processes are as efficient and effective as possible.
First, the define step helps to clearly define the goals and scope of the process. Furthermore, the model step creates a visual representation of the process.Moreover, the analyze step identifies areas of improvement in the process. Once potential improvements are identified, the design step creates a plan for implementing the changes. Finally, the implement step puts the new process into action. Throughout the BPM life cycle, continuous feedback and monitoring are essential to ensure the process is optimized over time. By following the BPM life cycle, organizations can improve their processes and achieve their goals more effectively.
11/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 110 5343: 3.How does business contribute to economic development? Please elaborate and state with an answer .                                     Businesses contribute to economic development in a number of ways. First, they create jobs and stimulate economic activity. They generate taxes that support infrastructure and public services. They also bring new products and services to the market, which improves the standard of living for consumers. In addition, businesses contribute to the development of human capital by providing training and development opportunities for their employees. They also invest in research and development, which spurs innovation and creates new technologies. Businesses can also have a positive impact on the environment by adopting sustainable practices and reducing their carbon footprint. Moreover, another specific way that businesses can contribute to economic development is by investing in local communities. For example, when businesses set up operations in a community, they often bring with them new infrastructure, like roads and utilities. They may also bring new educational opportunities, like scholarships or training programs. All of these things can help to improve the lives of local residents and spur economic growth.
11/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 110 5343: 4.Explain with an example from your life which shows your managerial skills or talents.                                                              As a business student, I've developed strong managerial skills through my coursework and extracurricular activities. My coursework has taught me how to lead teams and make decisions under pressure. In addition, my involvement in student organizations has given me valuable experience managing projects and budgets. For example, as President of the Business Club, I planned events, coordinated with vendors, and delegated tasks to other students. I believe my skills and experiences have prepared me to be an effective leader.In addition to my coursework and extracurricular activities, I've gained valuable insights from my continuous Assessment Learning Activities (CALA) and practicals. For example, in my last CALA  at a local startup, I was given the opportunity to lead a team of students and work on several projects. This experience taught me the importance of effective communication, setting clear goals, and providing constructive feedback. Overall, I believe my combination of academic and practical experiences has given me a strong foundation in managerial skills.
11/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 110 5343: 5.explain the importance of human resources in an organization.                            Human resources departments are responsible for recruiting, hiring, and retaining talent. They also manage employee relations, compensation, and benefits. In short, they help to ensure that the organization has the right people in place to achieve its goals. Without a strong human resources department, an organization would struggle to find and keep the talent it needs to succeed. It would also likely have lower employee morale and productivity. The human resources department is truly the backbone of any organization.Another important role of the human resources department is to ensure that the organization is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. For example, they must ensure that the organization is following all labor laws and regulations, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act. They must also make sure that the organization is compliant with all employment-related laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. In short, the human resources department is responsible for making sure that the organization is operating legally and ethically. This is an important role that helps to protect both the organization and its employees.
11/10/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on *Tuesday (17th of October).* <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 110 5343: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 110 5343: let me share with you the last two documents
11/10/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263781105343, May I know by when you'll be available to send the rest of the documents?
11/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 110 5343: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 110 5343: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 110 5343: I have sent all the documennts now and I am very sorry for the delays
11/10/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents, and no worries about the delays @263781105343. Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on *Tuesday (17th of October).*
11/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 110 5343: oky Ma'am noted
11/10/23, 2:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/DfTrDZ4fK7FJ5iSrO79wjv
11/10/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Shumirai Shammar John , and my EWYL group name is SHUMIRAI EWYL23E0773. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (17th of October) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
11/10/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 110 5343: okay Ma'am
11/10/23, 2:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of our last conversation and the documents you have submitted, we have successfully completed the first and second steps in your admission process and with that, now it is time to progress to the third step, which entails *university admission counseling.*

Once again to confirm our records: the course *BBA* has selected for her higher education is a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and it's my understanding that you're planning for her to arrive in India in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
11/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes that is very true
11/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/10/23, 2:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/10/23, 2:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes I agree with you
11/10/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263781105343 Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/10/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 110 5343 started a call
11/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes she told me about the registration fee
11/10/23, 2:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

*I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?*
11/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am
11/10/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
11/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 110 5343: okay Maam
11/10/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
11/10/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am
11/10/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
11/10/23, 4:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am
11/10/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
11/10/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/10/23, 4:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 110 5343: no Ma'am let's move on
11/10/23, 4:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, With this are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am I am very excited
11/10/23, 4:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to her chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
11/10/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
11/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 110 5343: duly noted Ma'am
11/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 110 5343: Thank you very much
11/10/23, 4:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome, Let's conclude our discussion for now. Have a great day ahead @263781105343
11/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 110 5343: oky Ma'am ..Same to you!
12/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 110 5343: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 110 5343: I have submitted the SOP
12/10/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation with us @263781105343, We have duly note that you have successfully submitted the SOP.
12/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 110 5343: You are welcome Maam
17/10/23, 11:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Shumirai,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. We have some incredible news to share with you and your family! 

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application at the universities in India under the Endowment plan.

Given the importance of focusing on your exams and the priority of the offer letter, what we can do is, if your parents are available, we can connect with them today to discuss the offer letter right here in your admission group.

Then, whenever you find some time in your schedule, you can go through the discussion we had, understand the letter better, and catch up with us. This way, you won't be left behind, and you will be in a position to share your thoughts and ask any questions you might have. We can then reconnect on Friday/Saturday to ensure we are all on the same page. What are your thoughts on this solution? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 7:57 am - +263 78 110 5343: I agree with yoy
18/10/23, 7:57 am - +263 78 110 5343: *you
18/10/23, 7:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing Shumirai, to ensure we can discuss the offer letter well and address any questions or concerns you may have, could you kindly let me know if your parents will be available to connect with us today in the evening at 07:30 PM? 

This would provide us with ample time to have a detailed conversation and guide you on the next steps you are to undertake to complete your admission formalities. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 7:59 am - +263 78 110 5343: at 7:30 they will not be available
18/10/23, 8:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me, Shumirai. If I may inquire, do they have a prior commitment at the same time, which might prevent them from connecting with us at that specific time? 

Additionally, could you please let me know at what time they would be available to connect with us, according to their schedule? This way, we can explore if there is a suitable time that aligns with their availability for our discussion.
18/10/23, 8:07 am - +263 78 110 5343: they are not able to attend the session at 7:30 because they will be at church ..I think we can schedule it for 8:30 PM CAT if you are comfortable with that time
18/10/23, 8:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, Shumirai, and that's absolutely fine. Given the time difference between India and Zimbabwe, our operational hours are typically scheduled from 08:00 am to 04:00 pm CAT.
18/10/23, 8:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: At the same time, we also recognize that parents sometimes have work commitments during the day. Therefore, we occasionally extend our availability and schedule operational hours in the evening to assist parents promptly. However, I am sure you understand that this might not be feasible every day.
18/10/23, 8:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: For today, I can certainly accommodate and connect with your family at 08:30 PM, which is 12:00 AM here in India. However, since we are scheduling this discussion specifically for you and your family, I hope your parents will be actively available at that time?
18/10/23, 8:15 am - +263 78 110 5343: okay ...Thank you very much for your commitment
18/10/23, 8:15 am - +263 78 110 5343: Yes they will be available at specified time
18/10/23, 8:17 am - +263 78 110 5343: I will be leaving you for now as my first exam is about to start ...Have a great day.
18/10/23, 8:18 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That sounds great, Shumirai. In that case, let us plan to reconnect in the evening at 8:30 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion and will be fully prepared to assist you.
18/10/23, 8:18 am - Vilsha Edoofa: During our today's meeting, we will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete your university admission formalities.
18/10/23, 8:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: For now, let's bring our conversation to a close. I wish you all the best for your exams and a blessed day ahead. Please convey our regards to your family as well.
18/10/23, 8:26 am - +263 77 455 9977: Most welcome, thank you for all you are doing to make it a success for our daughter Shumirai.
18/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 110 5343: thank you

18/10/23, 9:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Shumirai,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 9:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am ,we had the chance to go through the letter
18/10/23, 10:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263781105343. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 10:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
19/10/23, 5:14 am - +263 78 110 5343: Greetings Ma'am ...Sorry yesterday we faced network challenges before finishing our session and we are very sorry for that .
19/10/23, 5:15 am - +263 78 110 5343: starting from 1:00 PM CAT we will be all available for the session today
19/10/23, 11:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Shumirai,

Thank you for the update, and I understand that network issues can sometimes disrupt our sessions. I am glad to hear that you'll be available for today's session starting at 1:00 PM CAT.
19/10/23, 11:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am looking forward to a message from your end. Also, now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
19/10/23, 11:58 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, once you are available, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
19/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 110 5343: Greetings Ma'am ... I am back from the examination and we can continue with our discussion
19/10/23, 1:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are ready to proceed, @263781105343. Can you please let me know if you had the chance to review the questions I shared with you earlier? Your response to those queries will help us navigate our discussion more effectively.
19/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes I had the chance to review the questions
19/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 110 5343: I will answer them right away
19/10/23, 1:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @263781105343, I am looking forward to getting a response from your end.
19/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 110 5343: 1.$0.                                           2.3yearz                                           3.$1000.
19/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 110 5343: The last question I need your help
19/10/23, 1:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details Shumirai. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded her a 100% scholarship to you on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout your course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you also have been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
19/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes it is.
19/10/23, 2:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to see that you are following through. As you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
19/10/23, 2:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that Shumirai's per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means Shumirai's total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
19/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am
19/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 110 5343: thank you for the clarificatiob
19/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 110 5343: *n
19/10/23, 3:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome, if you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
19/10/23, 3:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how you can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
19/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 110 5343: noted
19/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 110 5343: you may proceed Ma'am
19/10/23, 3:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing to hear that @263781105343. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1250, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/10/23, 3:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am ..it is very clear
19/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 110 5343: on number 7.regarding the 24 hour wifi, is it paid monthly or per swmester
19/10/23, 3:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: @263781105343, the EWYL fee is part of your annual education cost and follows the same payment timeline as your other fees. We will discuss the payment timelines in detail shortly as we proceed with our discussion.
19/10/23, 3:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, let us get into how the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program can benefit you as a parent. Consider that you, through your hard work, earn scholarship credits totaling $1,000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
19/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 110 5343: okay
19/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 110 5343: okay noted
19/10/23, 3:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 3:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
19/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am I have clearly understood its importance
19/10/23, 5:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
19/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 110 5343: thank you for having confidence in me ..I promise that I will not let you down
19/10/23, 5:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Shumirai. With that said, let us not shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 110 5343: oky Ma'am noted
19/10/23, 5:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263781105343. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
19/10/23, 5:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason your per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
19/10/23, 5:14 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. But rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
19/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am it does make sense
19/10/23, 5:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said Shumirai, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier just like the offer you have from Galgotias University.
19/10/23, 5:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
19/10/23, 5:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this Shumirai?
19/10/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 110 5343: I would opt for the one with higher registration fee and save at least $850 annualy
19/10/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes thats right
19/10/23, 5:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Correct Shumirai. Now talking about the registration fee, let's turn our focus to the registration fee outlined in your offer letter. As mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
19/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am
19/10/23, 5:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now Shumirai, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as October 31st, 2023*.
19/10/23, 5:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/10/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 110 5343: oky Ma'am duly noted
19/10/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 110 5343: thank you for the clarification
19/10/23, 8:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 8:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 110 5343: no I reside in Chinhoyi
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)

20/10/23, 7:44 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Shumirai. Before we conclude our conversation, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
20/10/23, 7:44 am - Vilsha Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad. <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 7:44 am - Vilsha Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Tuesday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
20/10/23, 7:45 am - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am

30/10/23, 2:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Shumirai

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
30/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Maam
30/10/23, 4:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is wonderful and reassuring to hear that you have had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that your family must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
30/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 110 5343: As a family we are very happy and grateful for such a good opportunity and chance to study abroad as it comes once in a while .But we have been struggling for the past weeks due to a tragic incident which happened and have left us with a financial crisis and currently we are facing financial problems, and as per the recommendation of the letter we understand that the registration fee is wanted by tomorrow as it is the deadline  and that's what is really troubling us on how we are going to overcome this  challenge and make the payment on time
30/10/23, 4:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about the difficult situation you and your family are going through. I hope everyone is safe and well. Financial challenges can be tough to navigate. Could you please share more details about the incident that occurred and led to this situation? This information will help me better understand your circumstances and see how we can work together to address this challenge and make the payment on time.
30/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 78 110 5343: thank you very much for understanding ... As I said when I gave an introduction ,I stated that we are three girls in my family and I being the second daughter of my parents ..My Elder sister is called Shalom Anesu John ,she had an accident and she was badly  injured ,but some were minor injuries which included her hands and the left leg were only bruised but her right leg was  the one badly injured and the situation was very bad that it had to be taken of care as soon as possible .So as a family  the responsibility was for us to make sure that she gets treatment before things gets out of hand ..So she had to go for treatment at a private hospital here in Chinhoyi were she was stitched  and given medication and it was a little bit expensive because we were not expecting something like that to happen and all of the money saved in my parents savings had to be used for paying the medication and treatment ..So it became difficult for us as a family and we were not able to raise up the  funds quickly in order to pay the registration fee on time
30/10/23, 5:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about your sister's accident, Shumirai. It must have been a challenging time for your family. I hope she is on the path to recovery now. I understand that this unexpected incident led to the use of your family's savings, making it difficult to raise the funds for the registration fee. In light of this situation, could you please let me know how much you've been able to save so far for the registration fee? This information will help us determine the best way to assist you in meeting the deadline.
30/10/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes it was indeed a hard time for all of us but ar least we managed ti make sure that she gets treatment on time And now she is on her road to recovery ....So far we have managed to save $150 as the  incident just happened a week ago not far from now
30/10/23, 5:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am relieved to know that your sister is on the road to recovery. Considering that this incident happened just a week ago, it is understandable that it put financial strain on your family. In light of this, I propose that you go ahead and make the payment of $150 that you have managed to save tomorrow. This will allow us to secure your scholarship seat with the university, ensuring you don't miss out on this opportunity.

Once the immediate financial pressure eases, we can work together to create a flexible payment plan for the remaining $450. This approach will enable you to secure your scholarship while accommodating your family's situation. Does this sound like a feasible solution for you and your family?
30/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 110 5343: yes Ma'am thank you .. we will definitely discuss about this as a family and come up with a solution to this financial disaster
30/10/23, 5:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You're very welcome, Shumirai. I completely understand the situation and the financial challenges you're facing. It's good to hear that you will have a family discussion to come up with a solution. In light of the same, may I know when will you be able to give us a confirmation so as to ensure we can communicate with the university officials in a timely manner and help you navigate the challenge in a timely manner?
30/10/23, 6:17 pm - +263 78 110 5343: okay I will give you an update at 9:00PM CAT when everyone will be back home
30/10/23, 6:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for the update, @263781105343. Please take your time to discuss and come up with a plan that works for your family. We will be here at 9:00 PM CAT to hear from you and assist with any questions or decisions you may have.
31/10/23, 5:46 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Shumirai,
